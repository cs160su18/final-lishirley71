00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,500
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,560
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,260
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,770
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,440
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,410
I can't stand still, I can't stop

Daybreak hasn't come

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,080

If you want to go to

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,040
your toughness, that's what it takes

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,520
At any cost, One Piece,
I'll be the first

00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,400

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,970
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,470
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned

74
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,750
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,530
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,330
After leaving Punk Hazard,
the Straw Hats headed to Dressrosa.

78
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,540
But a mysterious man,
Breed, who leads a pack

79
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,140
of sea monsters made a raid on them

80
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,200
and kidnapped Caesar.

81
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,970
To take back Caesar, Luffy, Law,

82
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,080
and Chopper snuck into the enemy's ship.

83
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,740
There, they happily reunited
with a Kung Fu Dugong

84
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,230
who had become Luffy's disciple in Alabasta.

85
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,380
Pull your arm back all
the way - like this!

86
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,740
And use the lower half of your body!

87
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,410
However, Breed's Peto-Peto
Fruit power controlled

88
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,970
the Dugong and the others.

89
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,790
Breed gained control of Chopper, Luffy,

90
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,660
and even Law with his mysterious power.

91
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,500
Pet-peto!

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,900
Dammit!

93
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,790
I can control any living thing

94
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,260
and bring out all of its power!

95
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,750
You will see how deadly it is!

96
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,190
"Luffy Dies at Sea?!
The Pirate Alliance Comes Apart!"

97
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,290
Damn! I can't take it off!

98
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,360
Luffy, look up!

99
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,570
I can't control myself!

100
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,470
Damn!

101
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,340
Watch out!

102
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,030
Wait!

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
Chopper stopped!

104
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,370
You're just the bait.

105
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,990
My main target was you
two from the beginning.

106
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,700
What did you say?!

107
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,580
Wait!

108
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,250
Oh? I can't move!

109
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:17,880
Roo...

110
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,970
Wait!

111
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,120
You guys are going
to be eating out of my hand forever.

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,740
As long as I hold you two as my slaves,

113
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,740
there's nothing to be afraid of!

114
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,510
Straw Hat! Trafalgar!

115
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,710
Sit!

116
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,440
Dammit!

117
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,850
Shake hands!

118
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,300
Son of a bitch!

119
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,760
See what I'm capable of?!
This is the power of the Peto-Peto Fruit!

120
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,970
Whether you're a Warlord
or a rascal pirate

121
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,070
with a 400 million bounty,
you're powerless before me!

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,090
If you were an animal, you
could've become my pet.

123
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,300
But stinking humans like
you will become my slaves!

124
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,210
How cute!

125
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,330
I didn't realize because you
had a strange outfit on before!

126
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,750
Your blue nose is so cute, Raccoon-kun!

127
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,970
I've never had a pet like you before!

128
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,090
I'll dress you up right away!

129
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,390
Don't!

130
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,440
Oh, good boy, good boy, good boy!

131
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,430
Hey, get your hands off of Chopper!

132
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,830
Shut up! You two are
gonna get locked up!

133
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,520
Put Sea Prism Stone handcuffs on them!

134
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,450
It won't be long.

135
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,430
It won't be long
before my dream kingdom becomes reality.

136
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,720
Hey, Peto-guy! Let us out!

137
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,410
Give us back Chopper! Dammit!

138
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,800
You...

139
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,950
I'm losing my strength...

140
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,060
I guess the cage is...

141
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,100
...Made of Sea Prism Stone.

142
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,870
You guys are so pathetic.

143
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,530
Caesar!

144
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,830
Hey, let us out!

145
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,630
Shut up! Why does everybody
give me orders?!

146
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,930
Did he take control over you?

147
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,170
Yes, he did. A collar and a leash!

148
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,760
I feel like a pet!

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,470
But I'm a great scientist!

150
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,980
He said he's a Peto-Peto Fruit eater.

151
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,850
And with that power,

152
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,810
he can make people obey whatever order he gives.

153
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,560
Caesar, is he one of
Doflamingo's associates?

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,990
Are you stupid?

155
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,270
If he were, why would I be held captive still?

156
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,660
As far as I know,

157
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,630
Doflamingo doesn't have
any subordinates like him.

158
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,100
That guy told me he wants to create
a dream kingdom or something.

159
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,420
What kingdom?

160
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,120
How do I know?! Dammit!

161
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,570
It's so humiliating...

162
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,980
...for me to take that whip fool's orders!
Screw him!

163
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,800
Caesar!

164
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,120
Lie down!

165
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,480
Hey, Caesar!

166
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,280
I said "Lie down"! Can't you hear me?!

167
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Dammit! That asshole! I can't take it!

168
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,450
You guys can't get away from me!

169
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,070
Now,

170
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,160
it's all ready!

171
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,310
What should I make them to do for me?

172
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,490
Peto-guy!

173
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,680
Give us back Chopper...

174
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,020
You shitty humans never learn.

175
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,920
Don't worry. Chappy's here.

176
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,590
Chappy?

177
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,800
Chappy!

178
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,510
I'm not Chappy!

179
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,720
Chopper!

180
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,170
Chappy!

181
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,210
I'm Chopper!

182
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,510
Chopper, what are you wearing?!

183
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,870
Hey, Luffy! Stop laughing!

184
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,590
Oh... I'm exhausted because
of the Rumble Ball...

185
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,040
Are you shy because you're dressed up?!

186
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,150
No...

187
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,110
Oh, somebody's in a bad mood!

188
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,830
Stop!

189
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,500
Luffy!

190
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
Don't push your luck.

191
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,860
You must be happy when I pet you.

192
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,720
Submit to my demands!

193
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,510
Are you okay, Chopper?!

194
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,350
Yeah.

195
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,920
Chappy, get on your knees!

196
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,650
Lower to the ground!

197
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,690
Now, it's time for discipline!

198
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,870
Hey, stop!

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,560
I said "Stop"!

200
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,780
What are you doing to my friend?!

201
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,730
"Friend"...

202
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,630
"Friend"?

203
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,600
"Friend"!

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,380
"Friend"!

205
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,550
"Friend"!

206
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,750
"Friend"!!

207
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,990
Cut the "friend" crap!

208
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,820
I don't believe in friendship!

209
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,800
It's not worth a damn!

210
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,480
Listen! All I need is...

211
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,240
...loyal followers - tools -
who just work for me!

212
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,610
I have no need for insubordinates!

213
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,780
Everyone should just do as
I say without complaining!

214
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,420
Worthless humans always
stand against me!

215
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,040
That's why I have no need
for their friendship!

216
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,250
I don't need them!

217
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,970
But animals... pets are different!

218
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,860
They just follow my orders
quietly and submissively!

219
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,670
Animals! Pets! They're the best!

220
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,130
That's why I need you.

221
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,280
Caesar.

222
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,850
To make...

223
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,720
...this!

224
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,320
Is that... SMILE?!
Where did you get it?!

225
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,790
I have a connection
with the underground.

226
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm gonna use this Zoan type,
man-made Devil Fruit...

227
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,910
...to turn humans to animals forcibly!

228
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:09,010
Then there will be no more detectable,
pathetic humans in the world!

229
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,820
You bastard! What are you really up to?!

230
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,680
A kingdom.

231
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:21,290
I will create an animal-only kingdom -
without a single stinking human!

232
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,060
And I will conquer all the animals
using my Peto-Peto power!

233
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,410
I will turn them to loyal pets!

234
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,630
That's my dream kingdom!

235
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,750
Suit yourself!

236
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,310
But you can't make me follow anybody!

237
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,300
What are you talking about?!

238
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,150
Didn't you see what I'm capable
of with the Peto-Peto power?!

239
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,820
It means nothing to me!

240
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,990
You silly human!

241
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,830
Worthless humans like you should just
shut your mouths and follow my orders!

242
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,110
Stop resisting!

243
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,470
I'm a pirate!

244
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,220
I'm not gonna follow anybody's order!

245
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,040
Pirates should be free!

246
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,990
"Pirates"? "Free"?

247
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,050
I hate humans like you the most!

248
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,640
Alright.

249
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,980
I was gonna spare your
life and enslave you.

250
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,300
But all you damn humans
deserve death after all!

251
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,450
What is this place?

252
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,910
Where are we?!

253
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,340
It's showtime!

254
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,470
I'll show you the terror
of my Peto-Peto power!

255
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,550
Alright, Trafalgar, here
is my order to you!

256
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,570
Kill Straw Hat!

257
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,610
Tra-guy!

258
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,240
Straw Hat, I want you to kill Trafalgar!

259
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,650
Dammit!

260
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,690
No!

261
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,450
This is outrageous!

262
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,290
Go ahead and kill each other!
You can't use your Devil Fruit power though!

263
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,860
Punch each other to death
like idiots - just as you pathetic humans are!

264
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,370
Now, the bloody show begins!

265
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,980
Luffy! Law!

266
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,870
I can't believe this!

267
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,760
Tra-guy, it's no good!

268
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,590
I can't control my body!

269
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,940
Dammit!

270
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,860
Yes! This is the greatest show ever!

271
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,870
Damn! I can't stop myself!

272
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,200
I don't wanna fight you like this!

273
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,950
Dammit!

274
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,600
Get away from me!

275
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,880
Destroy each other! You foul humans!

276
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,890
The leash!

277
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,840
Keep fighting!

278
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,100
Tiptoe, stealthy steps... Goodbye!

279
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,960
What a fool.

280
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,690
He still doesn't understand
that nobody can get away from me.

281
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,790
Well, I'll let him go for now.

282
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,410
I'm enjoying this bloody show!

283
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,910
Seal, watch out!

284
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,720
Hey you, stay out of it!

285
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,560
Do you wanna get whipped?!

286
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,700
What?! Stop barking!

287
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,490
You fool!

288
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,180
Don't tell me you're
speaking against me!

289
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,920
Damn you!

290
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,840
Damn! Damn! Damn!

291
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,410
You idiot!

292
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,380
Stop!

293
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,430
Dugong!

294
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,650
Do you want to help them so bad?

295
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,840
Alright, if you insist, I'll stop them.

296
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,510
Straw Hat, Trafalgar, wait!

297
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,470
My body stopped.

298
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,490
Instead,

299
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,530
you do it.

300
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,480
Since you like them so much,
it'll be far more interesting

301
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,250
to see you beating them up!

302
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,720
Kill those two, Dugong!

303
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,460
Now, go!

304
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,820
That guy's terrible!

305
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,680
Seal, I'll be alright!

306
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,070
Do you realize what happens
if you disobey me?!

307
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,200
Now, throw them into the sea!

308
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,310
Seal!

309
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,450
I told you to use the lower half

310
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,320
of your body and pull your
arm back all the way!

311
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,490
But you sure got stronger!
