00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,270
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,060
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,240
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,770
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,380
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,760
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,250
With one hour left until
God Eneru's declared time limit,

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,540
there currently remain 25 survivors.

20
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,200
Cien Fleurs!

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,730
Stop!

22
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,160
It's too late for that now...

23
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,630
Can't breathe...

24
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,920
After defeating Yama and
discovering Shandora, the city of gold,

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,800
Robin found something even more surprising.

26
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,880
Could it be?!

27
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,160
The Poneglyph I searched the
world for, but could never find...!

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,480
In which case, the grand belfry
located in the center of the four altars

29
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,640
might contain the "text of real history"...

30
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,890
The Rio Poneglyph!

31
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,600
"0% Survival Rate! Chopper vs. Ohm,
the Sword Wielding Priest"

32
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,900
Just a little more...

33
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,320
Everyone will be so surprised
if I find the gold first!

34
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,820
Ruins up here, too...

35
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,280
Oww!

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,500
What's with this place?!
The ground's all crooked...

37
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,390
I'll go around that way.

38
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,940
Gold! Gold!

39
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,980
Wait. Wait, Holy.

40
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,920
Holy! Wait!

41
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,590
I got too carried away! I should've
just gone back! I'm going to die!

42
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,260
You're the third one to make it here today...

43
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,930
Eh?! Who're you?!

44
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,350
That spider-head is so careless!

45
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,480
You killed Gedatsu, didn't you?

46
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,160
He means that guy from earlier!

47
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,520
No, it's all right. Being rid of a
fool like him is best for the world.

48
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,900
Wouldn't you agree?

49
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,540
Huh? I tripped over--

50
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,970
Don't be so afraid. That's my
pet dog Holy. He won't bite.

51
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,820
B-But this guy is lying here, all torn up...!

52
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,990
Holy is well-trained, so he
won't bite anyone recklessly.

53
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,940
I cut that man up.

54
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,900
That's even scarier! Who are you?!

55
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,440
Who are you?

56
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,640
My name is Ohm.

57
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,260
You're scary!

58
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,530
Just be silent!

59
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,930
He's too scary! I don't like him!

60
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,080
I am saddened by the frailty of man.

61
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,250
Eh?

62
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,220
Why do people fight and rot,
despite knowing the transience of life?!

63
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,820
What, now?

64
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,990
They're born to be happy, and
they desire happiness in life,

65
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,020
only to die in battle!

66
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,220
In which case, it would've been
best to do nothing from the start...

67
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,300
Such is the dilemma of
man's nature... It's so sad...

68
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,440
But, there is one path to salvation!

69
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,650
Everyone just needs to die!

70
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,490
What scary stuff is this
guy saying?! Unbelievable!

71
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,160
What have you come here for?

72
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,500
Oh, I'm just looking for gold--

73
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,740
Greed begets strife.

74
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,800
Eh?

75
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,500
Allow me to save you.

76
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,760
You'll save me?

77
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,560
Once dead, you will do--
and desire-- nothing.

78
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,350
He doesn't plan to save me at all!

79
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,690
Why?!

80
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,320
Why is everyone charred black?!

81
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,550
It's almost as if they've
been hit by lightning...

82
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,270
Kamakiri...!

83
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,640
Kamakiri!

84
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,830
L-Laki...?

85
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,650
Yes!

86
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,420
Go... Go, Laki...

87
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,770
But, Kamakiri!

88
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,310
Wyper... is headed... for God's Shrine...

89
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,740
But... Eneru isn't there!

90
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,880
You can still stop him...

91
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,490
Stop Wyper...

92
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,220
All right! I understand! Save your breath!

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,130
No one... can beat him...!

94
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,880
I am lightning.

95
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,480
He's... invincible...

96
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:32,750
He's lightning... which people have
feared as God... since long ago...

97
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,810
I'll stop Wyper! Wait here!

98
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm going to leave Aisa's bag with you!

99
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,520
No one... can beat him...!

100
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,290
He's... invincible...

101
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,930
Kamakiri is so strong...
yet his will has been broken!

102
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,250
The Rumble-Rumble Fruit!

103
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,560
To think that Eneru has the
powers of a Logia-type Devil Fruit,

104
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,060
the most powerful kind of all...!

105
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,860
I have to stop him quickly!

106
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,250
I think I recognize this place...
Or not... No, I do...

107
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,120
Or not...

108
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,470
No, I do.

109
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,170
Does it just look similar?

110
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,020
Did you laugh just now?!

111
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,910
What? You're the one who
came along just to get food!

112
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,650
This is what you get when you're
with me! Got a problem with that?!

113
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,350
You idiot! Hey!

114
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,360
Hey...! Wait! There's no more food in there!

115
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,750
Let go! Hey!

116
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,010
Where are you flying off to?!

117
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,750
This is a crazy place I wound up in!

118
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:19,630
Exit, exit, where is the exit? The exit! Hey!

119
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,580
A dead-end?!

120
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,150
You can't be serious, I walked all this way!

121
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,830
Wait...

122
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,320
Could it be a trick door?

123
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,870
Ah! I might be able to go
forward if I bust through it!

124
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,140
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

125
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,960
Huh? It didn't even budge...

126
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,650
What's going on?!

127
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,120
He's not following me...! Whew!

128
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,050
Is he a priest too?

129
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,620
There are lots of places to hide here.

130
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,590
I just need to escape and meet up
with Luffy and the others!

131
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,160
He seemed like a swordfighter,

132
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,480
so if I stay hidden and get
further away, I can escape!

133
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,800
He's run quite a long way.

134
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,700
How foolish, running from salvation...

135
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,590
That itself is an attachment
to life, and an earthly desire...

136
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,420
However...!

137
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,930
There are no means to survive on
the sad path to attaining peace...

138
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,200
This is the Iron Ordeal,
with a survival rate of 0%!

139
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,270
Another voice disappeared!

140
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,060
Aisa?

141
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,790
I can't just sit here!
I'm going to find Laki!

142
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,200
Hold it!

143
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,060
Stop! Don't!

144
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,420
Urgh!

145
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,410
I said stop!

146
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:51,010
What's your problem?!
Let go! Let go of me! Let go!

147
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,980
This is none of your business!

148
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,030
Maybe not, but I can't just
leave a kid like you to die!

149
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,050
I'm a warrior!

150
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,050
Yes, yes, okay. Kid warrior.

151
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,400
Your glares don't scare me.

152
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,050
Umm, are you all right?

153
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,250
Just fine!

154
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,980
Here! There's no use struggling! Get on!

155
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,620
Urgh! No! Let go! I'm gonna
save everyone! Let go!

156
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,670
Knock it off or I'll slug you!

157
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,920
And no crying!

158
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,930
Even two of our crew
have already been done in!

159
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,440
I can't leave you alone!

160
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,430
Now hurry and get on.

161
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,990
No way!

162
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,720
Whoa, that scared me! What's with this cave?!

163
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,090
First there's an earthquake,
then a flood of sea clouds...

164
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,340
I almost drowned there!

165
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,180
Stupid thing! Open up!

166
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,780
Why is it so huge?!

167
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,160
Darn you! Where's the exit?!

168
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,280
Gum-Gum Gatling!

169
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,550
Nami-san! That leads into the forest!

170
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,340
Nami-san!

171
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,050
What do we do? They went into the forest...

172
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,360
Damn it!

173
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,270
You're tough!

174
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,040
What's that?!

175
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,970
Who's that?!

176
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,720
S-Something's coming!

177
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,310
Shoo! Go that way!

178
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,130
It's the Lord of the Sky!

179
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,940
Was that... Aisa?!

180
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,920
We're... inside the forest...!

181
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,490
Hey! Let me down! Are you listening to me?!

182
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,060
You stupid bird! I oughta chop you up!

183
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,440
Huh?

184
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,330
T-The giant snake! Hey!
Fly higher! Or we'll get eaten!

185
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,900
Hurry it up! Hey!

186
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,660
It's still coming after us!
It seems irritable for some reason...!

187
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,480
Why, you little...!

188
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,880
God's Shrine is at the
top of this Giant Jack!

189
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,910
And Eneru is there!

190
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,840
I'm going to bring an end to the
past 400 years of terrible history!

191
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,480
Here he comes.

192
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:09,510
Wyper... Climb that vine any further
and you'll reach God's Shrine.

193
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,420
Who gave you permission to pass?

194
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,910
Ohm!

195
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,250
There is no longer any point
in heading for God's Shrine.

196
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,560
Gan Fall!

197
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,500
What are you doing here?!

198
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,760
Still attached to the position of God?!

199
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,270
No, but I've yet to finish
taking responsibility.

200
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,710
I've just come from God's Shrine up above.

201
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,160
A tragedy... It was utterly destroyed...

202
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,060
Naturally, Eneru was nowhere to be found.

203
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,250
Perhaps it means he no
longer has any need for it...

204
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:15,850
It appears that their six years
of hard labor is nearing its end.

205
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,940
I thought I would come to bid you farewell.

206
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,500
Just what is it you people seek, Ohm?!

207
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,030
Eneru isn't in God's Shrine, you say?!

208
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,240
One of Straw Hat's friends?!

209
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,570
That took its toll...! That bird's gonna pay!

210
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,570
It's you!

211
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,330
What is this place?

212
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,500
Ruins?

213
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,770
Looks like we got us some
ferocious ones here...

214
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,470
Hey, hand over the gold!

215
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,320
Oh, my. How sad...

216
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,260
...given that none can
escape from my Iron Ordeal...

217
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,310
If you're going to get in my way,
I'll eliminate you all!

218
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:33,010
Tell me where Eneru and the Divine Squad are!

219
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,520
What's going on with this cave?!

220
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,840
Well, I'm sure you gentlemen
have all sorts of things to say,

221
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,690
but if you want to make yourselves heard...

222
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,040
...you'll need to survive here first!

223
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,830
Racing full speed ahead as always

224
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,580
A to Z, we run through it

225
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,380
We all have worries and fall many times

226
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,300
But we just need to rise to the top someday

227
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:31,770
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

228
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,830
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

229
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,330
I never treat you "bad"

230
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,030
How many times did we fall?

231
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:55,120
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

232
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,660
Smile! Come back to you, friends

233
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,470
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

234
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,390
Come back to you, friends

235
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,230
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

236
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,930
Come back to you, friends

237
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,540
It seems that it's getting a
little busy in the Upper Ruins...

238
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,060
What is it you're after?! Where is Eneru?!

239
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,370
The situation in the sky is not
our concern! Hand over the gold!

240
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,970
You're all in my way! You
can all... die together!

241
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,850
Seriously, where am I?!

242
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

243
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,150
"Climb Giant Jack!!
Deadly Combat in the Upper Ruins"

244
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
