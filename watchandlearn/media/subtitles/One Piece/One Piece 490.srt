2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,740
Luffy made a raid on the Navy HQ to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,400
However, both Ace and
Whitebeard lost their lives!

62
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,100
Whitebeard, Ace...

63
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,560
Let us handle the burial of those two.

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,880
Only because it's you, I
allow it, "Red-Haired"!

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,140
But...!

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,270
I will take the blame on myself!

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,930
Thanks.

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,680
Treat the injured now!

69
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,020
This war is...

70
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,000
...over!

71
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,880
"Mighty Leaders Face Each Other
Down! Heralding the 'New Era'!"

72
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,500
What's wrong with it? I can't hear it.

73
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,860
Is it because of a bad connection?

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,360
What happened in the war after all?

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Did the Navy win?

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,730
--They did, didn't they?
--It's getting clearer now.

77
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,200
--The Whitebeards have lost?
--Did the Navy really win?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,410
Regarding the war occurring at Marineford

79
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,900
being waged by the Whitebeards
and we, the Navy HQ,

80
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,160
the process took longer than anticipated
because of the enemy's persistence

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,800
but the Navy soldiers all
fought with a sense of justice

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,930
and defeated all the
Whitebeards and their allies

83
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,070
and now we are happy to tell you that
the Navy HQ gained a complete victory...

84
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,770
They did it!

85
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,410
The Navy is invincible!
Praise all our heroes!

86
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,470
I want to be called to
duty at the HQ someday!

87
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,600
The war is over!

88
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,180
Yes!

89
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm glad!

90
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,660
The legendary pirate - Whitebeard lost!

91
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,200
--The war is over, right?
--Yes! You're safe now!

92
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,030
--This is so great!
--They did it!

93
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,370
We're safe!

94
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,780
Hurrah for the Navy! Hurray
for the World Government!

95
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,480
And for victory and justice
and peace! Hurrah!

96
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,470
At the scene of the war - Marineford!
There are 7 ships out at sea!

97
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,640
Those who would take part in the new era...

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,780
...are there to witness this
great turning point in history.

99
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,740
Staring at the dust of the battle
rising above Marineford -

100
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,320
evidence of the workings of
justice in the Great Pirate Era -

101
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,580
they sense the restlessness
of the changing of the times.

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,290
Captain Drake.

103
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,710
Finally... it's over.

104
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,320
The Navy has to change, also.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,130
In no time,

106
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:34,050
Whitebeard's territory will sink in
a sea of blood in this whirlpool.

107
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,430
Blackbeard is the key.

108
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,890
He has gained new followers
and Whitebeard's power.

109
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,150
I'm sure they're gonna reign for while!

110
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,950
It's all... his fault!

111
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,410
I'll track him down soon enough!

112
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,250
Let's go! To the New World!

113
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,590
What the hell is going on?

114
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,210
What are you talking about, Apoo-san?

115
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,380
That guy will become his enemy.
Is he really gonna save him?

116
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,300
Huh?

117
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,970
I'm talking about Trafalgar Law.
He's known for his brutality.

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,100
He wouldn't save Straw Hat Luffy
if there wasn't some catch.

119
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,690
It's odd.

120
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,070
What's wrong, Captain Hawkins?

121
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,570
I've been trying to see the
odds that Luffy's still alive

122
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,880
but it never reaches zero.

123
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,520
To be honest, I was scared
when the war started,

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,750
but now the great pirate,
Whitebeard, is dead.

125
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,750
So it's really over, isn't it?

126
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,840
Yeah, it is.

127
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,400
What's over?!

128
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,650
The new force who emerged during this
war--that Blackbeard is quite a guy!

129
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,530
The New World is ruled by The Four Emperors.

130
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,240
Whitebeard, "Red-Haired", Kaido, Big Mam.

131
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,120
But since one of them is dead,

132
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,080
the World is out of balance and no
one can predict the consequences!

133
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,630
This is the beginning of a new era the
likes of which no one has ever seen!

134
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,890
The news of the Navy's victory
in the war at Marineford,

135
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,060
the biggest war since the beginning
of the Great Pirate Era,

136
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,220
spread all over the world
in the blink of an eye

137
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,990
and people are celebrating
the news everywhere.

138
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,700
East Blue.

139
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,990
EAST BLUE

140
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,990
Hurrah!

141
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,080
--Whitebeard is dead!
--Yeah!

142
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,580
--We're safe now!
--I'm so glad!

143
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,470
West Blue.

144
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,250
WEST BLUE

145
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,380
The sea will be in peace now!

146
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,960
Hurrah!

147
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,630
SOUTH BLUE

148
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,670
South Blue.

149
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,300
We're gonna have a bargain sale today!

150
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,090
So are we!

151
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,470
--The Navy has won!
--I'm so relieved!

152
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,430
North Blue.

153
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,180
NORTH BLUE

154
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,310
Yes! I'm so happy!

155
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,360
--Let's drink, everybody!
--We have tons of it!

156
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,150
Grand Line.

157
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,270
GRAND LINE

158
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,160
What should we do tomorrow?

159
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,530
I wanna play tag!

160
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,030
Hide and seek!

161
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,660
Alright!

162
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,450
God! Thank you!

163
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,880
Like most of history, some facts are
trimmed off as the news goes around

164
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,590
and just the two words
"Navy victory" stand out.

165
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,500
The people, in their excitement at the
news, failed to notice something...

166
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,550
W-What's going on?!

167
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,480
Look at you people! That's hilarious!

168
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,110
Whitebeard said that the great
treasure - One Piece is real!

169
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,030
I'm gonna find it!

170
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
There is so much more out
there! Let's set sail!

171
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,710
Navy victory.

172
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,510
The result is not necessarily peace...

173
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,960
NEW WORLD: FOODVALTEN ISLAND

174
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,140
Y-You can't come any further!
Don't come into our town!

175
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,190
With the loss of a deterrent -
namely, the threat of Whitebeard -

176
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,480
the world of the seas has
become very unsettled...

177
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,960
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

178
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,480
Here you are!

179
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,800
We've had word from Impel Down!

180
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,310
Is Magellan alright?

181
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,810
He got beaten badly and is barely alive.

182
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,610
He's been treated intensively
by the medical team.

183
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,110
He's a dutiful man - he's blaming himself.

184
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,200
They said that if he could
move now, he'd kill himself.

185
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,620
Don't let him do such stupid thing!

186
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,520
Y-Yes, sir!

187
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,460
What has been going on at the prison?

188
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,880
Allow me to tell you the
condition as it stands.

189
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,300
The situation on level 6 is especially
bad. It's literally a disaster.

190
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,760
A disaster?

191
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,760
UNDERWATER PRISON IMPEL DOWN

192
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:25,280
LEVEL 6

193
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,470
What's up?

194
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,000
You prisoners're doomed to
be stuck behind bars forever!

195
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,450
You've got nothing to do except wait to die!

196
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,540
Then how about this?! Why don't
you fight each other in the cell?!

197
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,670
I will free those of you who
survive as members of my crew!

198
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,510
--Really?!
--Get me out of here!

199
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,520
Let me be your crew member!

200
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,650
So he has freed selected members from
the worst criminals in the world?!

201
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes. But only 4 prisoners were taken.

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,200
San Juan Wolf, Avalo Pizarro,
Vasco Shot, Catarina Devon.

203
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,210
But there are obviously more
prisoners missing from level 6!

204
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,670
Which means...

205
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,510
I understand. Then, there are
more escapees from level 6!

206
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:38,230
If even one of the prisoners from level
6 sneaks into a country somewhere,

207
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,480
the people will be in grave danger!

208
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,980
Check to see how many there were.

209
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,200
Get their names, and put a
most wanted list out now!

210
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,910
What's wrong?

211
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,580
Well, I...

212
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,220
I'm under orders from the World Government

213
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,400
to keep this level 6 matter secret.

214
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,630
More blunders will harm the
Government's reputation.

215
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,400
Damn them!

216
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,100
You bastard!

217
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,020
Doflamingo!

218
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,690
Moria, you're too weak to go
on with the title as a Warlord.

219
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,280
"Died in the War of the
Best" sounds better...

220
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,990
...than "done in by the Government".

221
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,370
Whose idea was this?! Sengoku?!

222
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,380
No, someone much higher up the ladder!

223
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,390
It's hot... Too hot...

224
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,100
Why is it so hot? I can't take it.

225
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,570
Could you shut up already?!
You're making me feel hot too!

226
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,030
You're hairy. I don't blame you.

227
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,890
I don't like it when we submerge.

228
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,970
We have to stay in such a cramped place...

229
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,530
...with messy people.

230
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,410
You're the messiest!

231
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,830
I can't take it! I have no choice but...

232
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,210
--...to make you feel the same!
--Stop it!

233
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,710
--You're so hot!
--That's gross!

234
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,720
Come on!

235
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,720
I beg you! A little bit is fine!
Let me get some fresh air!

236
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,930
Alright! Now, stop rubbing your sweat on me!

237
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,600
Surface! Let's surface now!

238
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,500
It's so refreshing! How nice it is outside!

239
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,540
Now I'm cool! Right side - okay!

240
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,290
Left side - okay!

241
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,090
Front...

242
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,090
Snake - okay! Snake?!

243
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,560
--What the hell?!
--How did a snake get here?!

244
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,560
Oh no!

245
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,810
A Navy ship!

246
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,270
--Tell Captain!
--Someone's there!

247
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,980
A Warlord - the Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock!

248
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Don't worry. I turned all
the Navy soldiers to stone.

249
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,360
So how is Luffy doing?

250
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,870
Is it bad? He'll recover, won't he?

251
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,970
How did you know that we
were gonna surface here?

252
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,970
I was scared thinking that the
Navy was still chasing us.

253
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,800
I made Salome follow you underwater.

254
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,180
--I see!
--Don't change the subject, you fuzzy beast!

255
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,520
--I'm sorry!
--So weak!

256
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,520
How is Luffy doing? Tell me now...

257
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,110
Oh, Captain!

258
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,110
THE HEART PIRATES – CAPTAIN TRAFALGAR LAW

259
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,110
I did everything I could.

260
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,830
You mean, he's okay?

261
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,660
We were able to stabilize him. However...

262
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,720
...he took greater damage than you think.

263
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,460
There is no guarantee
that he will survive yet.

264
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,550
It's no wonder!

265
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,040
Who's talking?

266
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,400
Straw boy couldn't even
stand up at Impel Down once!

267
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,980
--Straw Hat was risking his life!
--We got out of the prison thanks to him!

268
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,120
Because of him, we can
make our dream come true:

269
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,650
To go to the Kamabakka Kingdom!

270
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,820
Let's go!

271
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,270
To the New Kamas' home from New Kama Land!

272
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,540
What are they?

273
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,440
They are prisoners of Impel Down.
Looks like they're Luffy's friends.

274
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,330
They have snuck into the ship.

275
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,760
I can't believe that he
pushed himself that hard!

276
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,470
That's how much he wanted
to save his brother Ace!

277
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,100
That's right! We know how much
he pushed himself to do it!

278
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,850
But that brother died in front of his eyes...

279
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,810
...in order to protect him...

280
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,950
There is no justice in this world! It's
not surprising that he broke down!

281
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,450
Damn it all! Hang in there, Straw Hat!

282
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,620
You got to live! You got to, Straw Hat!

283
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:42,390
What a tragedy! I wish
I could take his place!

284
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,090
Poor Luffy!

285
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,280
I'm jealous...

286
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,230
It must be nice to have the Pirate
Empress care about you that much...

287
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,230
Yeah, yeah...

288
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,230
By the way, are you a friend of Straw boy?

289
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,190
No, I didn't have to save him at all.

290
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,900
If you're wondering about my motivation,
I can come up with a reason.

291
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,120
No, that's okay. Sometimes your
instinct tells you what to do.

292
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,830
--Hey, wait!
--You can't walk around yet!

293
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,010
--Don't push yourself like that!
--He told you to rest!

294
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,270
--The wound could open up!
--Where are you going?

295
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,070
Jimbei!

296
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,600
You're Trafalgar Law from
the North Blue, aren't you?

297
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,390
Uh-huh.

298
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,450
Hey, is it okay for you
to move around like that?

299
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,130
Thank you!

300
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,980
You saved my life!

301
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,280
You must rest. It could kill you.

302
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,530
I can't ease my mind. It's impossible!

303
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,910
What I have just lost
was too important to me!

304
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,830
That is why I know that Luffy-kun
must be going through far worse!

305
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,880
At least, his instinct to protect himself

306
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,090
forced him to lose
consciousness at that time!

307
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,960
Even if he survives,

308
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,050
I can't stop worrying about
the moment that he wakes up.

309
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,200
You, fuzzy beast, do you
have a Transponder Snail?

310
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,350
Yeah... I mean... yes, ma'am!

311
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm sorry!

312
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,990
--I'm jealous. He's like her servant...
--Yeah, yeah...

313
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,280
I'm gonna call the Kuja's ship so we can go

314
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,330
across the Calm Belt even with this submarine.

315
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,970
If the Government finds out that Luffy's
alive, they're gonna come after him!

316
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,210
Let us harbor him at the Maiden Island!

317
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,130
What?!

318
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,960
If they still see me as a
Warlord, Luffy can rest safely!

319
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,160
Luffy...

320
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,730
At Hancock's suggestion,

321
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,050
Luffy is taken to Maiden Island
so his wounds can heal,

322
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,800
and there he finally regains consciousness.

323
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,150
But as his memories of the battle return,

324
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,810
Luffy is overtaken by deep despair.

325
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,210
On the net episode of One Piece!

326
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,020
"Landing at the Maiden Island!
The Harsh Reality Falls upon Luffy!"

327
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
