00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,670
K-Kagari?

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,210
Wait!

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,310
Kagari...

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,720
Where is it?

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,480
The precious gift... Mommy gave me.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,190
Precious gift, huh?

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,030
Big Sis Rumi...

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,280
Well, meow?

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,540
Hmm... I've got maybe a week left.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,710
Feel bad for the others, though.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,420
Suzu-meow, what's that?

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,580
Ah...

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,500
This is a treasure of mine.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,050
Oh, is that you?!
Which means the one next to you is...

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,760
Yup. It's a photo with Mom.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,930
Why do you look so grumpy in the picture, meow?

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,480
To be honest, I don't really remember.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,900
Yeah, I don't remember...

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,400
By now, I've forgotten...

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,530
Suzu-meow...

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,650
Oh?

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,360
Uh, Mo-- Yuki-san?

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,490
It's been a while.

25
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,280
My brother?

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,410
He's doing all right, I guess.

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,660
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,580
I haven't heard from him at all lately,

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,500
so I wondered if he's feeling
under the weather or something.

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,960
I see... Well, if he's fine, that's good.

31
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,350
I can't wait to see Maho-san.

32
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,900
Try not to miss her. Don't forget she's so...

33
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,280
Hiyajo-san.

34
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,030
Long time no see, you guys.

35
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,870
"Marbled Port-Cutlet Sandwiches"
"Chicken & Rice"

36
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,620
Maho-san seems to be doing well.

37
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,500
Yeah, apparently she came to help the Professor.

38
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,170
What a busy girl.

39
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,250
I wonder if Kagari-chan is doing well too?

40
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,720
Me too. I know Daru and
Suzuha were looking for her...

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Yeah...

42
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
By the way, where's Hashida-san?

43
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,390
I guess he had something important to talk
with Suzu-meow about, so he couldn't come.

44
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,560
Hmm...

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,020
"Television"
"CRT Workshop"

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,400
What the hell, Dad?!

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,860
Wh-What's that scary face for?

48
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,820
Put your hand on your heart and think about it.

49
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,740
Hand on my heart?

50
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,080
If you keep doing crap like that,
Mom's really gonna get taken by somebody else!

51
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,250
Eh? Say again? What do you mean?

52
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,710
I saw it...

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,090
I saw Mom talking all friendly
with some other guy.

54
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,630
Miss Amane was?

55
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,710
When's the last time you saw Mom?

56
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,010
Um, when I went to visit Miss Fubuki...

57
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,300
Since then?

58
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,390
Why don't you meet her more often?!

59
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,520
B-Because! I've been so busy
with the time leap machine and stuff...

60
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,860
You could find the time if you wanted to!

61
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,730
Sorry...

62
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,700
What if this keeps up and
Mom ends up marrying someone else?

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,490
Hmm... Maybe it's no big deal?

64
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,160
It was probably just some guy asking
for directions or trying to sell her something.

65
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,750
And if it wasn't?

66
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,170
If you're that worried about it,
why don't you just go and ask her?

67
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,750
How come you're not the least bit concerned?!

68
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,300
At this rate, I might never
end up being born in the future!

69
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,640
But doesn't the fact that you're here
right now mean you'll be born for sure?

70
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,930
Hmm?

71
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,560
Is that... Miss Amane from the future?!

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,810
Ooh! Loli Suzuha is lovely!

73
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,980
That isn't the point! Look closer!

74
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,730
Eh?

75
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,860
Why are you so faded out?

76
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,990
It's been like this for a while now.

77
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,030
--That's just like Back to the--
--Dad!

78
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,240
Wh-What?

79
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,450
You have zero confidence, Dad.

80
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,210
It's because you lack confidence
that instead of making the first move,

81
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,790
you're waiting and hoping for her to.

82
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,210
Am I wrong?

83
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,460
That's...

84
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,260
No future awaits those
who refuse to take action.

85
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,970
Eh?

86
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,760
That's something you
told me a long time ago, Dad.

87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,100
I said all that?

88
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,890
But, that's--

89
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,810
Listen to me!

90
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,230
If you and Mom aren't getting along,
I might be in trouble! I mean it!

91
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,150
Too-too-roo! We're here!

92
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,150
Huh?

93
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,860
Ruka-kun and Moeka-san too?

94
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,120
What's going on here?

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,540
Big Sis Mayu...

96
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,790
We're going to need your help.

97
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,620
Eh?

98
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,920
Um, so... Before their date tomorrow,

99
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,710
you want Daru-kun to learn
how to have confidence in himself?

100
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,590
I'm no good at things like that,
which is why I need everybody's help.

101
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,970
Did you use that photo, meow?

102
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,640
Big Bro!

103
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,470
Y-Yes?!

104
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,810
Our mission will now commence!

105
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,650
The operation objective:
Concluding their date tomorrow,

106
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,900
Hashida Itaru will confront Amane Yuki
and confess his feelings for her.

107
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,780
C-Confess?!

108
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,070
That's crazy talk!

109
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,780
That's not what I want to hear! Try again!

110
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,370
Miss Suzuha! Yes, ma'am! Miss Suzuha!

111
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,170
The poor girl wanted to see you so badly that
she was begging "Let me come to Japan too!"

112
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,380
I said no such thing.

113
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,970
By the way, Lintahlo... How is that report
we discussed the other day coming along?

114
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,090
Well, I have it right here.

115
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,930
Oho? You impress me.

116
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,260
"Maho-san! Help me!"

117
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,270
Suzuha-san?

118
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,060
It's nothing special, but here it is.

119
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,230
Lintahlo.

120
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,480
Modesty isn't always a good virtue in practice.

121
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,690
Especially if you're hoping
to go far in America.

122
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,820
Sorry, I mean...

123
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,780
Thank you.

124
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,790
I'll have to put aside some time tonight
to sit back and read this report of yours.

125
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,460
If it's good enough, you might be
able to transfer before you know it.

126
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,420
Great.

127
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,920
And I'm sure Maho would love that too.

128
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,090
Professor!

129
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,430
"Incoming Call: Mayuri"

130
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,470
What's up?

131
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,180
Ah, Okarin?

132
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,690
Um, a bunch of us are gathered at the lab right now,
so I was wondering if you wanted to join us?

133
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,770
At the lab?

134
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,570
Yeah... Will you come?

135
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,570
Sorry... Maybe another time.

136
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,280
I see... Okay, no problem!

137
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,490
That's too bad. Keep it up, Okarin!

138
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,460
If you wanna be a popular guy, you've gotta
know all the tasty places to go, meow!

139
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,550
So without further ado, we'll be drilling good
restaurants and manners into your head, meow!

140
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,010
Miss Faris! Yes, ma'am! Miss Faris!

141
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,980
Yuki-san is a huge cosplayer, right?

142
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,650
So, I'm thinking if you wear
something different than usual,

143
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,520
it might make her heart flutter, you know?

144
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,490
Miss Mayuri! Yes, ma'am! Miss Mayuri!

145
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,780
To be honest, the most important thing
is to understand a woman's heart.

146
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,620
"Keep the conversation fun and exciting."

147
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,670
Well, Big Bro?

148
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,330
Feeling confident yet?

149
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,460
Huh? Uh, yeah...

150
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,630
I can't believe you had me come here for this...

151
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,260
You're kidding me, right?

152
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,930
Maho-san! Where's Okarin?

153
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,100
The professor made me leave without him.

154
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,730
Will you help us?

155
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,900
It's a pain for me too
if Hashida-san stays like this.

156
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,730
Fill me in on the details.

157
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,900
Actually...

158
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,370
In other words, he needs more
confidence dealing with women.

159
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,490
What's that?

160
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,330
For now, let's just say an experimental
system with an improvement or two.

161
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,170
But basically, it's something
of a sleep-learning device.

162
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,920
Hashida Itaru.

163
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,050
Believe it or not, you're a lady's man.

164
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,560
Not even Don Juan could compare
to your charm and success.

165
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,310
I-I'm a successful man...

166
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,640
Now...

167
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,600
Open your eyes.

168
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,450
Yuki-san.

169
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,160
Hashida-san?

170
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,920
Bring the usual.

171
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,750
Very well.

172
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,710
You come here that often?

173
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,970
Because I'm a successful man.

174
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,760
R-Right...

175
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,470
Was that any good?

176
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,060
Perfect, meow!

177
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,230
I don't know... Do you think it's going well?

178
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,400
It has to be! I know it!

179
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,650
Maho-meow's idea is sure paying off big time!

180
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,030
Well, I never thought it'd be so effective...

181
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,740
Wow! This is beautiful!

182
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,240
It is, but...

183
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,450
You're even more beautiful.

184
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,130
Thank you...

185
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,420
What a romantic mood!

186
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,670
All that's left is for Big Bro
to deliver the final blow!

187
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,800
Look, meow!

188
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,050
Um, today was--

189
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,050
Yuki-san.

190
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,100
Umm, Hashida-san?

191
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,440
I have something to say, Yuki-san.

192
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,390
Uh...

193
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,730
Yuki-san, will you...

194
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,200
Will you...

195
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:51,000
"Recognition of the Asymptotic Line

196
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,130
I failed...

197
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,130
Dad, get a hold of yourself.

198
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,090
It's not like you were rejected, right?

199
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:06,140
No matter how you look at it,
she's gotta hate me, noob!

200
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,180
Will you...

201
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,350
Oh no... Look at the time...

202
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,230
Eh?

203
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,190
I need to get going.

204
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,230
Huh?!

205
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,650
I had so much fun today. Thank you.

206
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,700
Uh...

207
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,450
I knew it was pointless...

208
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:29,240
Deep down inside, she doesn't
want to be asked out by a guy like me.

209
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,630
But I was all cocky and misread the situation
and had the nerve to hold her hand...

210
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,670
Yeah, and just look at my body...
My hands are sticky and sweaty and nasty.

211
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,880
I bet she was thinking to herself...

212
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,180
Eww! Disgusting! Let go of
my hand already, you slimy pervert!

213
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,640
No! Mom's not that kind of person!

214
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,350
I knew it was too good
to be true from the start...

215
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,740
Think about it! Why would such a cute
girl ever decide to marry a guy like me?!

216
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,990
That just doesn't happen, it's common sense!

217
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,870
Miss Amane will end up with somebody else...

218
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't say stuff like that, Dad!

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,500
But you're the one who said it was happening...

220
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,790
Dad...

221
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,960
Sorry, but I need some time alone...

222
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,470
Suzu-san, I'm sorry.

223
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,720
Big Sis Mayu...

224
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,390
No, this all happened
because I doctored that photo.

225
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,900
I went too far as well...

226
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,570
No...

227
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,400
It's not your fault...

228
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,660
It's my fault.

Yeah...

231
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,040
Just like then...

232
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,420
Mom! Mom!

233
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,500
Suzuha!

234
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,340
Watch out!

235
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,970
M-Mom?

236
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,160
Dad?

237
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,200
Could we talk maybe?

238
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,580
Yeah.

239
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,220
The future that I came from...
It wasn't such a peaceful world.

240
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,730
I never spent much time together with
you and Mom. There wasn't a chance to.

241
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,070
So...

242
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,700
The truth is...

243
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,040
I just wanted to see it.

244
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,670
My mom and dad who gave
birth to me, getting along together...

245
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,840
That way, I'd feel like
I'm heading down the right path.

246
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,300
I thought that'd be the proof I needed...

247
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,720
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,600
Her talking to some other guy
and me disappearing was a lie.

249
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,270
I lied to you.

250
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,900
Well, I kinda figured you were.

251
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,820
Huh?

252
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,900
Yeah, I knew...

253
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,240
Dad...

254
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,700
It doesn't matter if you
were lying or telling the truth.

255
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,540
I just... wanted someone
to give me that push on the back.

256
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,170
I was being selfish.

257
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,170
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

258
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,920
Dad...

259
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,050
Miss Amane?

260
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,300
Sorry about today.

261
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,390
Yeah, so hey...

262
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,390
Tomorrow, do you want
to meet up with me again?!

263
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,440
Yeah... Yeah, yeah.

264
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,980
Later.

I can't compete with you, Dad.

268
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,460
Good grief...

269
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,790
What the heck am
I supposed to do all on my own?

270
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,300
Miss Amane!

271
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,840
Today was lots of fun. Thank you.

272
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,180
Right back at you. Thanks for
hanging out with me two days in a row.

273
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,520
Miss Amane?

274
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,900
Personally, I think you're wonderful
when you act like yourself.

275
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,210
Uh, um...

276
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,920
Dad...

277
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,260
I-I...

278
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,760
I think of you and feel...

279
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,100
...Moe Moe Kyun!

280
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,610
Dad...

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,750
Thank goodness...

282
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,050
With this, I can...

There's so much I want to talk about."

284
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,520

There's so much I want to talk about.

285
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,610
Lintahlo. Sorry to keep you.

286
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,700
Oh, no. It's okay.

287
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,530
Forgive me. Work at the hospital
has been one problem after another.

288
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,540
But I did look over your report.

289
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,250
There are a few areas that need polishing up,
but your viewpoint and ideas are interesting.

290
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,340
Do you have time to stay
and answer some questions about it?

291
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,380
Sure, that's fine with me.

292
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,180
Your brother cares for you very much.

293
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,940
Yeah... I couldn't wish for a better family.

294
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,320
So, my brother...

295
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,780
Please take good care of him.

296
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,490
Me too.

297
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,120
Itaru-san makes me
Moe Moe Kyun too, you know?

298
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,630
Suzuha... I'm so happy I gave birth to you...

299
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,590
Thank you.

300
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,060
H-Huh?

301
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,730
This is weird...

302
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,400
I'm... Why am I...?

303
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,320
It's okay. You don't have to say anything.

304
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,820
Aren't you going to be in it?

305
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,070
It's fine, it's fine!

306
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,940
Her and I will take plenty together from now on.

307
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,740
I'm taking it.

308
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,370
Are you sure?

309
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,920
If I keep bugging you two any longer,
I'll feel like a third wheel.

310
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Shall we?

311
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,500
Okay.

312
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,640
Thank you, Mom...
