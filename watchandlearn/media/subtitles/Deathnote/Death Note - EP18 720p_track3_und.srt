00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,020
Ally

17
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,520
Ah, you can't go through with this belt...

18
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,670
Huh? Still doesn't work?

19
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,720
Huh? Still doesn't work?

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,720
Hmm... we really don't have a choice but to accustom you to the security measures around here, no?

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Hmm... we really don't have a choice but to accustom you to the security measures around here, no?

22
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,380
How about... this?!

23
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,930
Good day!

24
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,350
What's happened to your forehead?

25
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,130
Oh, this?

26
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,500
Well, I had a fight with my wife.

27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,120
My kid is still young, so it looks like I'm going to have to commute here.

28
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,040
Yes, it would be better for you to go home.

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,590
Yes, it would be better for you to go home.

30
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,680
What a waste! The rooms here are incredible!

31
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,870
What a waste! The rooms here are incredible!

32
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,930
You should just move in yourself, with the family and all.

33
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,610
Don't treat me like I'm a single, easy-going guy such as yourself.

34
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,420
Where's Ryuuzaki?

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,800
A date.

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,900
He's gone on a date, along with Light-kun, in Misa-Misa's room.

37
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,020
Surveillance cameras, eh?

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,830
Well, I guess it's unavoidable considering Amane is somehow connected to the second Kira.

39
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, I guess it's unavoidable considering Amane is somehow connected to the second Kira.

40
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,820
And Matsuda, stop calling her "Misa-Misa"!

41
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,990
Oh, okay...

42
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,710
Hey! You know, for me, this just isn't feeling like a date.

43
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,760
Please, don't mind me.

44
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,410
Anyway, aren't you going to eat that cake?

45
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,130
Sweet things make you fat, so I avoid them.

46
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,120
As long as you use your brain, you won't get fat, even if you eat sweets.

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,270
Ah! You're making fun of Misa again!

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,610
Fine. How about I give you the cake if you leave me and Light alone?

49
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,860
If I leave you alone, I'd still be watching you on the surveillance cameras; it'll still be the same.

50
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,290
Pervert! Will you just quit with all this tasteless stuff, already?

51
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,280
Whatever you say, I'm still taking your cake.

52
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,300
That's okay. We'll just close the curtains and turn off the lights.

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,580
The cameras detect infrared as well.

54
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,020
More importantly, despite moving into these headquarters filled with equipment, Ryuuzaki, you seem to lack the motivation to do anything.

55
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,970
More importantly, despite moving into these headquarters filled with equipment, Ryuuzaki, you seem to lack the motivation to do anything.

56
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,010
More importantly, despite moving into these headquarters filled with equipment, Ryuuzaki, you seem to lack the motivation to do anything.

57
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,800
More importantly, despite moving into these headquarters filled with equipment, Ryuuzaki, you seem to lack the motivation to do anything.

58
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,200
Motivation?

59
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,290
I don't have any.

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,640
To be honest, I'm pretty depressed.

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,270
Depressed?

62
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,680
Yes.

63
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,020
Because I've always thought that Light-kun was Kira, the idea that this theory may be wrong has come as quite a shock.

64
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,820
Because I've always thought that Light-kun was Kira, the idea that this theory may be wrong has come as quite a shock.

65
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,430
Still, I have my suspicions...

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,390
Hence the reason for these.

67
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,820
But then again, Kira can manipulate people's actions.

68
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,350
In other words, Kira was manipulating you in such a way that I would suspect you...

69
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,000
Both Light-kun and Misa-san were being manipulated by Kira.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,980
If you think about it this way, it does seem to make sense...

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,490
By that reasoning, even though Misa and I were being manipulated, we were still Kira.

72
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,270
By that reasoning, even though Misa and I were being manipulated, we were still Kira.

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,820
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

74
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,870
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

75
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,770
You're both Kira.

76
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,990
According to my theory, Light-kun was Kira when I imprisoned him.

77
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,010
And from that moment, criminals stopped dying.

78
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,660
Until then, the theory that Light-kun was Kira still worked.

79
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,330
Yet, two weeks later, criminals started dying again.

80
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,440
Yet, two weeks later, criminals started dying again.

81
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,840
So from here, we move to the next assumption...

82
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,880
Kira's powers can be passed from person to person.

83
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,100
That's an interesting theory, but if that's the case, then catching Kira will be no small feat.

84
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,890
Yeah, that's why I'm stumped.

85
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,840
Even if we catch those being manipulated, their power will just pass to someone else, and no memory of it will remain.

86
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,510
Even if we catch those being manipulated, their power will just pass to someone else, and no memory of it will remain.

87
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,030
No matter how many people we manage to catch, it'll be pointless.

88
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,370
But none of this has been confirmed yet. Try and rouse some motivation.

89
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,570
But none of this has been confirmed yet. Try and rouse some motivation.

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,290
Motivation?

91
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,400
I don't have much.

92
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,430
In fact, it's probably better if we don't try too hard.

93
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,640
If we chase them too desperately, we'll just be placing our own lives at risk... don't you agree?

94
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
If we chase them too desperately, we'll just be placing our own lives at risk... don't you agree?

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,570
Ryuuzaki...

96
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,070
That hurt.

97
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,840
Don't fuck with me.

98
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,620
You have no motivation because your little theory about me being Kira was wrong?!

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,080
Perhaps I phrased that badly. I meant that making the first move might work against us, so--

100
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,700
Perhaps I phrased that badly. I meant that making the first move might work against us, so--

101
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,920
How are we supposed to catch them if we don't even chase them?!

102
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,750
How many innocent people do you think have already been entangled in this?!

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,050
Besides, weren't you the one who imprisoned both Misa and myself?!

104
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,380
I know... but no matter what reasons you had, my motto is... an eye for an eye.

105
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,630
I know... but no matter what reasons you had, my motto is... an eye for an eye.

106
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:59,160
I know... but no matter what reasons you had, my motto is... an eye for an eye.

107
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,150
I know... but no matter what reasons you had, my motto is... an eye for an eye.

108
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,030
It's not that my theory was wrong, merely that "Yagami Light is Kira" and "Amane Misa is the second Kira" wasn't enough to solve the case.

109
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,040
It's not that my theory was wrong, merely that "Yagami Light is Kira" and "Amane Misa is the second Kira" wasn't enough to solve the case.

110
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,350
That's why I'm depressed.

111
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,850
Is it so wrong for a human to feel this way?

112
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,310
I'd say it was wrong.

113
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,990
The way you're talking, it sounds like you won't be satisfied unless I really am Kira.

114
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,890
The way you're talking, it sounds like you won't be satisfied unless I really am Kira.

115
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,450
I'm not satisfied unless Light-kun really is Kira?

116
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,170
You could be right.

117
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,210
I've only just realized... I wanted you to be Kira.

118
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,990
I've only just realized... I wanted you to be Kira.

119
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,580
Remember, an eye for an eye.

120
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm fairly strong you know.

121
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,480
W-We should contact them and get them to stop.

122
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,540
W-We should contact them and get them to stop.

123
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,770
Yes?

124
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,210
Ryuuzaki! Get this!

125
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,430
Misa-Misa was voted top of the Eighteen readers' popularity poll!

126
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,330
Oh, I see.

127
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,890
This means that she'll be the star in Director Nishinaka's next movie!

128
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,690
What's wrong?

129
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,190
It's just Matsuda being his usual dumb-ass self.

130
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,410
Well, Matsuda-san is a bit of an airhead by nature.

131
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,940
I can hear you both...

132
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,150
Two Months Later

133
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,300
Ryuuzaki, I know you've got no motivation for anything, but can you take a look at this?

134
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,870
Ryuuzaki, I know you've got no motivation for anything, but can you take a look at this?

135
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,880
Look at this carefully. It seems like this might be hinting at something.

136
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,670
Look at this carefully. It seems like this might be hinting at something.

137
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,010
All three of them held important positions within enterprises that represent Japan.

138
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,550
Tamiya
Rokuhei

Kawashima
Tatsuya

151
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,090
All three of them died from heart attacks.

152
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,680
As a result, Yotsuba's share prices have risen, while those of other enterprises have fallen.

153
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,860
Simply put, all these deaths have benefited Yotsuba.

154
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,070
Simply put, all these deaths have benefited Yotsuba.

155
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,710
If you search a little deeper, there have been thirteen incidents like this over the last three months.

156
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,010
What do you think?

157
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,470
The only conclusion I can draw from this, is that Kira is backing Yotsuba.

158
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,390
Yes, but if this is true, killing criminals isn't Kira's primary objective.

159
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,060
Yes, but if this is true, killing criminals isn't Kira's primary objective.

160
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,450
Yes, but if this is true, killing criminals isn't Kira's primary objective.

161
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,070
Yes, it's possible that they're using the act of killing criminals as a camouflage for killing people for their own profit.

162
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:30,420
Yes, it's possible that they're using the act of killing criminals as a camouflage for killing people for their own profit.

163
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
So, how's that? Feeling slightly more motivated now?

164
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,010
So, how's that? Feeling slightly more motivated now?

165
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,010
It's impressive that everything is going this smoothly; nobody suspects anything at all.

166
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
Both Yotsuba's share price and profits have gradually been rising without gaining attention.

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,260
Yes.

168
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,580
Everything is going exactly according to our calculations.

169
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,670
There's just one thing that's been on my mind... the three we killed last week... why did they all die of heart attacks?

170
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,770
There's just one thing that's been on my mind... the three we killed last week... why did they all die of heart attacks?

171
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,120
There's just one thing that's been on my mind... the three we killed last week... why did they all die of heart attacks?

172
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,540
For one of them, I thought we decided on an accidental death?

173
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,010
Wangansen is a coastal highway in Tokyo.

174
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,010
It's probably because we specified the place of death as along the Wangansen.

175
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,540
However, at the time of his death, he wasn't at home, but was secretly with a woman in Italy.

176
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,940
So, if there's an impossible element in the cause of death we provide...

177
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,890
So, if there's an impossible element in the cause of death we provide...

178
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,470
Kira will merely kill them with a heart attack.

179
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,490
That's why I said last week that if we just request for a death either via an accident or illness,

180
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,240
he'll eliminate them in the fastest and most natural way possible.

181
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,420
Anyway, the police should already have their hands full investigating the deaths of criminals.

182
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,950
Anyway, the police should already have their hands full investigating the deaths of criminals.

183
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,950
If there was someone who was able to trace these civilian deaths back to us, they would have to be some sort of god.

184
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,880
If there was someone who was able to trace these civilian deaths back to us, they would have to be some sort of god.

185
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,900
Furthermore, it's all been taken care of already.

186
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,660
Chief! Ah, Mogi-san! Thanks for all your hard work.

187
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:58,910
Chief! Ah, Mogi-san! Thanks for all your hard work.

188
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,810
Chief! Ah, Mogi-san! Thanks for all your hard work.

189
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,880
Chief! Ah, Mogi-san! Thanks for all your hard work.

190
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,600
It's amazing! Thanks to Light-kun's work, there's a real possibility that Kira is connected to the Yotsuba Group.

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,600
It's amazing! Thanks to Light-kun's work, there's a real possibility that Kira is connected to the Yotsuba Group.

192
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,940
Yotsuba?

193
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,990
Er, that's right...

194
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,320
That's probably it, Matsuda.

195
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,060
Just now, I heard from the Deputy Chief that Kira has been sending bribes to politicians.

196
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,060
Just now, I heard from the Deputy Chief that Kira has been sending bribes to politicians.

197
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,120
This is what Kira is promising... in return for the police simply ceasing their pursuit of Kira, they would leave the politicians untouched.

198
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,620
This is what Kira is promising... in return for the police simply ceasing their pursuit of Kira, they would leave the politicians untouched.

199
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,210
The police have sold out to Kira.

200
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,990
Mogi has already made his decision.

201
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,060
Aizawa, Matsuda, if you still want to pursue Kira, you'll need to follow Mogi and myself, and hand in your resignations to the police!

202
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,230
Aizawa, Matsuda, if you still want to pursue Kira, you'll need to follow Mogi and myself, and hand in your resignations to the police!

203
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,130
Aizawa, Matsuda, if you still want to pursue Kira, you'll need to follow Mogi and myself, and hand in your resignations to the police!

204
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,810
Aizawa, Matsuda, if you still want to pursue Kira, you'll need to follow Mogi and myself, and hand in your resignations to the police!

205
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,260
Unless we decide to resign from the police, we'll no longer be allowed to investigate Kira seriously.

206
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,230
Unless we decide to resign from the police, we'll no longer be allowed to investigate Kira seriously.

207
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,870
W-What's the meaning of this?!

208
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,110
W-What's the meaning of this?!

209
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,470
It's very simple. They said that if I continue to investigate with L, I'll be fired.

210
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,250
It's very simple. They said that if I continue to investigate with L, I'll be fired.

211
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,950
It's very simple. They said that if I continue to investigate with L, I'll be fired.

212
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,420
S-So, Chief, what did you do?

213
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,030
S-So, Chief, what did you do?

214
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,480
In a few hours, I'll no longer be the Chief.

215
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,400
But you have your own lives, so think carefully before you decide what to do.

216
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,020
But you have your own lives, so think carefully before you decide what to do.

217
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,360
You're right, especially those with wives and children...

218
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,970
You're right, especially those with wives and children...

219
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,300
I think that all of you should return to the police force.

220
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,010
I originally began alone...

221
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm grateful that you've all managed to stick with it for so long.

222
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,670
But I'll be able to do this alone.

223
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,010
And I promise to visit you all with Kira's head as a present to the police.

224
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,090
Ryuuzaki, as long as I'm here, you won't be alone.

225
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,580
Ryuuzaki, as long as I'm here, you won't be alone.

226
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,170
I've made this promise as well.

227
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,980
That's correct. Until Kira is caught, I'll need Yagami-kun to stay with me.

228
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,930
That's correct. Until Kira is caught, I'll need Yagami-kun to stay with me.

229
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,710
However, the rest of you should return to the police force.

230
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,880
Didn't you once say that you needed the cooperation of the police with this case?

231
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,890
That was because then, the police, as an organization, was prepared to disobey Kira and maintain its stance on this investigation.

232
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:15,880
But help from a few civilians who have quit the police can't really be said to be with "the cooperation of the police".

233
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,060
The police have decided not to catch Kira. You've done enough.

234
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,230
The police have decided not to catch Kira. You've done enough.

235
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,750
Well, it's true that if we leave the police, we may not be of much help to you,

236
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,920
but what about our feelings?! We've put our lives on the line for this case!

237
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,730
but what about our feelings?! We've put our lives on the line for this case!

238
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,540
We should have the right to decide by ourselves: do we want to continue investigating, or return to the police?

239
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,700
I guess so... in that case, please make your own decision.

240
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,000
I guess so... in that case, please make your own decision.

241
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:45,980
B-But Chief, by quitting the police we'll be without a job.

242
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,440
B-But Chief, by quitting the police we'll be without a job.

243
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,430
B-But Chief, by quitting the police we'll be without a job.

244
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,290
Even if we manage to catch Kira, what are we supposed to do after that?

245
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,980
Even if we manage to catch Kira, what are we supposed to do after that?

246
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,710
After that? I hadn't really thought of that, but I'm guessing that once we've caught Kira, we'd have to... find new jobs.

247
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,260
After that? I hadn't really thought of that, but I'm guessing that once we've caught Kira, we'd have to... find new jobs.

248
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,780
After that? I hadn't really thought of that, but I'm guessing that once we've caught Kira, we'd have to... find new jobs.

249
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,440
After that? I hadn't really thought of that, but I'm guessing that once we've caught Kira, we'd have to... find new jobs.

250
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,040
I've decided! I'm going to quit the police and continue chasing Kira!

251
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,980
I've decided! I'm going to quit the police and continue chasing Kira!

252
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:17,630
I've got a job as Misa-Misa's manager, besides, if I return to the police, I'd feel like a loser--

253
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,830
Watch what you say, Matsuda.

254
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,780
Is it possible to return to the police, and help out in my spare time?

255
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,940
No. If you're planning to return to the police, please don't come here again.

256
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,850
No. If you're planning to return to the police, please don't come here again.

257
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,900
I swear I won't reveal a single thing from this place!

258
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,360
I definitely won't give you any information from here.

259
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,730
If you want to pursue Kira as a lone policeman, then that's up to you.

260
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't think it'd be right for you to quit as a police officer, and then go chasing Kira to the point of causing your family concern.

261
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,020
It's exactly as Ryuuzaki says. If you decide to stop now, no one will blame you.

262
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,350
It's exactly as Ryuuzaki says. If you decide to stop now, no one will blame you.

263
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,640
That's right. We won't think of you as a traitor!

264
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,710
That's right. We won't think of you as a traitor!

265
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,310
But Chief, you also have a family...

266
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,970
Our circumstances are completely different.

267
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,220
This is so unfair. I wanted to stay as well...

268
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,180
This is so unfair. I wanted to stay as well...

269
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,480
I approached this knowing that my life was going to be at risk...

270
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,110
And if I quit now, how can I face Ukita?

271
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,950
Damn it! Why has it become wrong for a police officer to chase Kira?!

272
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,990
Damn it! Why has it become wrong for a police officer to chase Kira?!

273
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,690
Ryuuzaki... didn't you make me promise that if anything happens to any member of the investigation, including being fired by the police,

274
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,550
Ryuuzaki... didn't you make me promise that if anything happens to any member of the investigation, including being fired by the police,

275
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,560
Ryuuzaki... didn't you make me promise that if anything happens to any member of the investigation, including being fired by the police,

276
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,710
I would provide them and their family with sufficient financial aid for a lifetime?

277
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,090
Why are you reluctant to tell them this?

278
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,010
Mind your own business, Watari.

279
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,010
I apologize.

280
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,120
What? You've even acted to protect our livelihood?

281
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,930
What? You've even acted to protect our livelihood?

282
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,690
Isn't that great, Aizawa-san?!

283
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,690
Ryuuzaki, were you testing me to see whether I'd leave the police and continue here?

284
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,740
Ryuuzaki, were you testing me to see whether I'd leave the police and continue here?

285
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,270
I-It isn't like that, Aizawa! Ryuuzaki just hates to say things like that himself.

286
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,040
I-It isn't like that, Aizawa! Ryuuzaki just hates to say things like that himself.

287
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,350
I-It isn't like that, Aizawa! Ryuuzaki just hates to say things like that himself.

288
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,730
T-That's right!

289
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,030
T-That's right!

290
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,790
No.

291
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,140
I was testing him.

292
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,000
I wanted to see what choice he'd make.

293
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,980
Ryuuzaki...

294
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,880
Fine, I get it! I'm leaving this investigation and returning to the police.

295
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,010
Fine, I get it! I'm leaving this investigation and returning to the police.

296
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,730
Aizawa-san!

297
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,760
I was unable to make an instant decision like you, and was leaning towards returning to the police.

298
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,270
I was unable to make an instant decision like you, and was leaning towards returning to the police.

299
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,000
There's no reason to be stubborn...

300
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,120
No! I quit!

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,860
collisionline

302
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,860
No! I quit!

303
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,710
I've just realized... I hate Ryuuzaki, his methods, all of it!

304
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,700
I've just realized... I hate Ryuuzaki, his methods, all of it!

305
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,680
I've just realized... I hate Ryuuzaki, his methods, all of it!

306
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,170
You know, Aizawa-san, I like people that are like you...

307
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,330
You know, Aizawa-san, I like people that are like you...

308
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,450
That's the other thing I hate! The fact that you can say that with such a straight face!

309
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,700
That's the other thing I hate! The fact that you can say that with such a straight face!

310
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,980
I'm out of here!

311
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,170
Thanks for all your hard work.

312
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,310
I've found another one!

313
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,900
A branch manager from one of Yotsuba's biggest rival banks.

314
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,660
September 7th - slipped on the stairs at home and died.

315
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,590
September 7th, that makes it a Friday.

316
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,320
Taking a look at this again, it just occurred to me that all the deaths which benefit Yotsuba happen towards the end of the week.

317
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,180
Taking a look at this again, it just occurred to me that all the deaths which benefit Yotsuba happen towards the end of the week.

318
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,740
Eh? Really?!

319
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,830
Eh? Really?!

320
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,040
At first the times of death were random; however, they've gradually begun to cluster around the time from Friday evening until Saturday afternoon.

321
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,370
At first the times of death were random; however, they've gradually begun to cluster around the time from Friday evening until Saturday afternoon.

322
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,510
That's an excellent observation, Chief!

323
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,230
I keep telling you that I'm not "Chief" anymore.

324
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,130
No. To me, you'll always be the Chief!

325
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,230
No. To me, you'll always be the Chief!

326
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,150
This is an excellent lead, father!

327
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,010
I'm not planning to lose to you and Ryuuzaki just yet.

328
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,780
I don't want to be a dead weight around here.

329
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,830
Dead weight...?

330
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,480
Is Kira a part of Yotsuba? Is Kira merely using Yotsuba?

331
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,880
Is Kira a part of Yotsuba? Is Kira merely using Yotsuba?

332
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,630
I've got no idea which it is, but we can assume that Kira is behind this.

333
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,370
I've got no idea which it is, but we can assume that Kira is behind this.

334
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,520
It's time that we investigate Yotsuba thoroughly.

335
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,820
I've finished compiling a list of all Yotsuba's employees, both here and overseas.

336
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,930
Thank you.

337
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,930
Over 300,000 people! How did he manage this so fast?

338
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,470
Over 300,000 people! How did he manage this so fast?

339
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,930
That's amazing, Mogi-san!

340
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,970
There was always something amazing about Mogi-san, right from the start.

341
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,970
R-Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do? Other than being a manager?

342
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,000
R-Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do? Other than being a manager?

343
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,390
R-Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do? Other than being a manager?

344
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,020
R-Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do? Other than being a manager?

345
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,650
You want to make yourself useful?

346
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,740
Yes!

347
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
Then, can you bring me another cup of coffee?

348
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,250
And don't forget our guests as well.

349
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,680
Who are they?

350
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,350
When did they get in here?

351
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,580
They're our new members.

352
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,940
I'm Aiber, a con artist. Nice to meet ya.

353
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
I'm Aiber, a con artist. Nice to meet ya.

354
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,210
I'm Aiber, a con artist. Nice to meet ya.

355
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,490
I'm Wedy, a thief by trade.

356
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm Wedy, a thief by trade.

357
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,040
A-A con artist and a thief?!

358
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,790
A-A con artist and a thief?!

359
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,340
That's correct.

360
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,820
Aiber acquires and learns what is necessary for every social discourse, and is guaranteed to form an intimate connection with his target.

361
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,770
We'll be using him as our spy.

362
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,220
Wedy is a thief that can crack any safe, key or security system.

363
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,740
As proof, she was able to infiltrate this place without anyone noticing her.

364
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,470
W-We'll be investigating with criminals?

365
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,650
W-We'll be investigating with criminals?

366
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,190
They're criminals, but not the type that appear in public. Kira will not be able to judge them.

367
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,490
They're criminals, but not the type that appear in public. Kira will not be able to judge them.

368
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,040
Try to think of them as professionals from the underworld.

369
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,810
I get it. In order to investigate Yotsuba properly, we'll need such people.

370
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,090
I get it. In order to investigate Yotsuba properly, we'll need such people.

371
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,670
Let's all work together on this.

372
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,360
Yeah!

373
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,010
Okay...

374
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,400
It's Papa!

375
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,570
Papa!!

376
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,230
Yumi... Eriko?

377
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,010
Yumi... Eriko?

378
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,000
What are you doing in such a place?

379
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,020
If you're going to come home, just say so. I haven't bought you any dinner.

380
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,900
If you're going to come home, just say so. I haven't bought you any dinner.

381
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,640
I'll give you half of my croquettes!

382
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,030
Yeah... I haven't had a lot of rest, so they've given me some leave.

383
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,090
Yeah... I haven't had a lot of rest, so they've given me some leave.

384
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,240
"Leave"? You have time off?

385
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,850
Yup, that's right.

386
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,310
Yay!

387
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,580
From now on, I should get some time off every week.

388
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,130
That means we can come to this park... even the zoo... or theme parks...

389
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,770
That means we can come to this park... even the zoo... or theme parks...

390
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,530
That means we can come to this park... even the zoo... or theme parks...

391
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,240
What's wrong?

392
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,460
Mama... papa is crying.

393
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,430
Mama... papa is crying.

394
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

395
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,320
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

396
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,320
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

397
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,450
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

398
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,450
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

399
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:39,230
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

400
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:39,230
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

401
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,010
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

402
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,010
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

403
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:51,080
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

404
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:51,080
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

405
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,220
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

406
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,220
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

407
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,870
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

408
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,870
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

409
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,030
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

410
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,030
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

411
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,510
Samazama na negative ni

412
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,510
I'm not so weak,

413
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,840
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

414
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,840
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

415
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,700
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

416
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,700
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

417
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,740
Preview

418
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,330
A top secret meeting?

419
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,000
They make it sound like they have one every week...

420
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,800
Bingo!

421
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,840
I'm on a roll today!

422
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,760
Next Time

423
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,760
Matsuda
