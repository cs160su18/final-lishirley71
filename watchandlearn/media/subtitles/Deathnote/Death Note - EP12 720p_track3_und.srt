00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

16
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,060
Love

17
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Yagami

18
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,110
Light, Ryuuzaki has asked for your help with the investigation.

19
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,320
Light, Ryuuzaki has asked for your help with the investigation.

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,480
If you're willing to help, we need you to come here as soon as possible.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,780
I understand, father.

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,810
And here I was thinking of how to start discussing the subject with them...

23
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,170
I never imagined that they would approach me with this first.

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,050
In this manner, I'll be able to investigate both the Investigative Headquarters and the fake Kira as much as I want.

25
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,100
Whatever it takes, I've got to find the fake Kira before they do.

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,120
Thank you, Yagami-kun.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,340
No problem; after all, we both want to catch Kira, Ryuuga.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,360
No problem; after all, we both want to catch Kira, Ryuuga.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,400
Please call me "Ryuuzaki" while you're here.

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm Matsui.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,890
I'm Aihara.

32
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,560
And I'm Asahi.

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,400
I see...

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,240
So, does that make me "Asahi Light"?

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,950
Yes, That is good.

36
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,080
While you're here, I'll call you "Light-kun".

37
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,540
Sorry for throwing you in at the deep end, but I need you to look over all the current material we have on the investigation, including the videos that were sent to the Japanese TV station.

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,190
Sorry for throwing you in at the deep end, but I need you to look over all the current material we have on the investigation, including the videos that were sent to the Japanese TV station.

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,380
Sorry for throwing you in at the deep end, but I need you to look over all the current material we have on the investigation, including the videos that were sent to the Japanese TV station.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,130
I'm afraid that I can't let you take any of the material away, or make notes of it.

41
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,890
Understood.

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,740
In that case, let's begin.

43
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,160
Light...

44
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,800
Last night

45
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,320
So... we'll proceed by hiding the possibility of a second Kira, and by having Yagami Light assist us with the investigation.

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,150
So... we'll proceed by hiding the possibility of a second Kira, and by having Yagami Light assist us with the investigation.

47
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,080
So... we'll proceed by hiding the possibility of a second Kira, and by having Yagami Light assist us with the investigation.

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,420
B-But won't it be hard for us to investigate with him if we do that?

49
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,750
B-But won't it be hard for us to investigate with him if we do that?

50
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,840
He's right. What's the point in him helping us in this investigation anyway?

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,520
He's right. What's the point in him helping us in this investigation anyway?

52
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:05,240
No, we only need to hide this from him till we've heard his opinions on these videos.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,570
Light-kun's skills of deduction are truly quite amazing.

54
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,050
If he sees these videos, he may be able to deduce that this is the work of a second Kira.

55
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,220
If he sees these videos, he may be able to deduce that this is the work of a second Kira.

56
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,390
But the basis for claiming that there is a second Kira... you say that the victims of the predicted murders were ones Kira wouldn't normally have killed, "since they only committed minor crimes",

57
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,360
But the basis for claiming that there is a second Kira... you say that the victims of the predicted murders were ones Kira wouldn't normally have killed, "since they only committed minor crimes",

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,200
but that theory of yours is the only basis we have, isn't it Ryuuzaki?

59
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,370
That's not the only reason.

60
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,990
Up until now, we've assumed that Kira needs a face and a name in order to kill.

61
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,400
Yet, from the fact that Ukita-san was killed when he happened to rush to the TV station that time... and from the fact that Kira spoke as if they could kill L merely by having him appear on TV,

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,560
Yet, from the fact that Ukita-san was killed when he happened to rush to the TV station that time... and from the fact that Kira spoke as if they could kill L merely by having him appear on TV,

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,290
we can come to the conclusion that the second Kira can kill people merely by seeing their faces.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:58,920
If, after reviewing the case and watching these videos, Light-kun is able to deduce that there is a second Kira, the majority of my suspicions against him will be lifted.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,650
What do you mean by that, Ryuuzaki?

66
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,030
It's evident that Kira wants to kill the L who has been leading the police force.

67
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:15,290
If things continue to progress as they are, I will die after appearing on TV in three days' time.

68
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,030
I doubt that Kira would let an opportunity like this pass.

69
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,780
What if my son doesn't manage to deduce that there is a second Kira?

70
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,040
Does it mean that your suspicions will deepen?

71
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,850
No. If that happens, my suspicions will remain at 5% or lower.

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,160
No. If that happens, my suspicions will remain at 5% or lower.

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,710
We'll reveal to him that we're investigating the possibility of a second Kira, and have him assist us with that.

74
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,230
I believe that you have understood from this that I am Kira.

75
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,680
On the date and time specified...

76
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,130
Watching these videos... the terrible quality of them makes me feel sick... is that just because I am the real Kira?

77
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,510
Watching these videos... the terrible quality of them makes me feel sick... is that just because I am the real Kira?

78
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,840
Watching these videos... the terrible quality of them makes me feel sick... is that just because I am the real Kira?

79
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,550
This is far more serious than a simple drop in my image as Kira...

80
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,490
But why has no one offered any explanations for any of these videos?

81
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,530
There's something odd going on here...

82
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:08,170
Either way, I better not say anything stupid regarding this.

83
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,960
If I leave things as they are, L will die.

84
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,970
How is it going, Light-kun? Have you been able to deduce anything from this?

85
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,010
How is it going, Light-kun? Have you been able to deduce anything from this?

86
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,090
Why you--!

87
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,580
There's a possibility that there's more than one person who has Kira's power.

88
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,060
K-Kira's power? What are you saying, Light?

89
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,830
K-Kira's power? What are you saying, Light?

90
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,400
K-Kira's power? What are you saying, Light?

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,940
If nothing else, there's a high probability that this is not the same Kira that we've been dealing with until now.

92
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,780
If nothing else, there's a high probability that this is not the same Kira that we've been dealing with until now.

93
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,750
The Kira we've been dealing with until now would not have utilized the suspects used in this broadcast.

94
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,120
Add the fact that if Kira does indeed need a name and a face to kill, it's strange that they were able to kill the policemen who merely happened to go to the TV station.

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,330
Add the fact that if Kira does indeed need a name and a face to kill, it's strange that they were able to kill the policemen who merely happened to go to the TV station.

96
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,140
I-It's the same...

97
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,090
I-It's the same...

98
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,780
The same as L... I mean, that's exactly the same theory as Ryuuzaki!

99
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,390
The same as L... I mean, that's exactly the same theory as Ryuuzaki!

100
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,150
The same as L... I mean, that's exactly the same theory as Ryuuzaki!

101
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,790
W-Well done, Light!

102
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,600
W-Well done, Light!

103
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,610
The suspicions against you should now be lifted.

104
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,090
That's right, Light-kun. We also believe that there's a second Kira.

105
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,100
That's right, Light-kun. We also believe that there's a second Kira.

106
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,540
As I thought...

107
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,130
You already knew, Ryuuga? I mean.. Ryuuzaki.

108
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,180
You already knew, Ryuuga? I mean.. Ryuuzaki.

109
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,310
You were testing me, weren't you?

110
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,610
I wasn't testing you.

111
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,600
If I were the only one to have come up with the "second Kira" theory, people may have trouble believing me.

112
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,470
Since you've come to the same conclusion as I did, it's become a much more convincing viewpoint.

113
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,290
Light-kun, you really are extremely helpful.

114
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,290
So, it's decided.

115
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,110
Firstly, we have to stop the second Kira.

116
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,130
Evidently, they sympathize with Kira, but they aren't very intelligent.

117
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,890
They might even obey the real Kira.

118
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,340
Thus, there's a good chance that we might be able to stop them by sending them a message from the real Kira.

119
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,130
Thus, there's a good chance that we might be able to stop them by sending them a message from the real Kira.

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,870
I'd have expected nothing less from you, Ryuuzaki.

121
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,890
I was also thinking of that as the best course of action.

122
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,060
I'd like you, Light-kun, to play the real Kira.

123
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,390
I'd like you, Light-kun, to play the real Kira.

124
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,040
M-Me?!

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,090
M-Me?!

126
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,180
Yes. With your talent, it shouldn't be a problem.

127
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,290
Yes. With your talent, it shouldn't be a problem.

128
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,670
Anyhow, we don't have a lot of time.

129
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,910
Can you write a response from "Kira" ready to be aired on this evening's news?

130
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,180
You bastard...

131
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,380
Is this what you planned all along? Is that why you brought me here?

132
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,000
Is this what you planned all along? Is that why you brought me here?

133
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,670
Ryuuzaki, is this okay?

134
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,670
Ryuuzaki, is this okay?

135
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,050
I really think I became Kira, just for a moment.

136
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:36,430
It's very good... but unless you take out the bit that says, "I don't mind if you kill L"... I'll die.

137
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:44,730
Ah, yes. If I were in Kira's shoes, in the current situation, I'm sure I'd order L's death.

138
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,100
It's just a joke. You can change it to whatever you want.

139
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,000
It's just a joke. You can change it to whatever you want.

140
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,150
Yes...

141
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,640
Aihara-san, the report is ready.

142
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,910
Aihara-san, the report is ready.

143
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,800
Okay!

144
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,060
A terrible thing has occurred!

145
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,790
In response to the videos sent in by Kira and aired on Sakura TV, messages have been received from another person claiming that they are the real Kira.

146
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,500
They have demanded that the message from the real Kira is broadcast on all TV channels.

147
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,010
Police Headquarters have agreed for the video to be broadcast.

148
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,370
Is this Kira? Or are they both Kira?

149
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,810
Is this Kira? Or are they both Kira?

150
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,990
First, take a look at this video sent in by Kira.

151
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm Kira.

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,020
Yay! I got a response from Kira!

153
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:39,000
I am the real Kira, and those videos sent to Sakura TV were not from Kira.

154
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,290
Currently, I will tolerate the actions of the one that is taking my name.

155
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:49,800
They have worked on my behalf, and have tried to aid me.

156
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,930
However, taking the lives of innocent people is directly against my beliefs.

157
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,710
However, taking the lives of innocent people is directly against my beliefs.

158
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:07,540
If the person taking my name holds the same beliefs as I, and is willing to help me, they must stop acting impulsively, and learn to understand my true intentions.

159
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,270
Let's see now... Video, video!

160
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,900
If you do not heed this warning, you will leave me with no choice but to pass judgement on you.

161
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,230
hidden lines

162
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,620
What are you planning on doing?

163
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,590
Naturally, I'm gonna send a response to Kira right away!

164
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,600
Naturally, I'm gonna send a response to Kira right away!

165
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,950
A few days later

166
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,930
Ryuuzaki! We've received a response from the second Kira!

167
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,070
Ryuuzaki! We've received a response from the second Kira!

168
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,970
What?!

169
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,160
It's here!

170
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,280
I'll bring the envelope and everything else over as soon as I can; for the moment, I'm sending a copy to your computer.

171
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,370
I'll bring the envelope and everything else over as soon as I can; for the moment, I'm sending a copy to your computer.

172
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,070
Kira-san, thank you for your response.

173
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,330
Kira-san, thank you for your response.

174
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,000
I will do as you ask.

175
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,910
We did it!

176
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,770
"I will do as you ask", huh?

177
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,440
I can't tell whether I can use them or not...

178
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,290
If they truly understood Kira's feelings, they should have enforced L's appearance on TV, and killed him!

179
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,950
If they truly understood Kira's feelings, they should have enforced L's appearance on TV, and killed him!

180
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,680
Don't mess things up... Damn it!

181
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,370
Don't mess things up... Damn it!

182
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,950
I want to meet you, Kira-san.

183
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:05,750
I don't believe that you have the eyes, but don't worry, I won't kill you.

184
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,510
What is this idiot thinking?!

185
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,960
They're talking about the Shinigami's eyes on a video that's being broadcast to the entire nation!

186
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,090
Did they just say, "I don't believe that you have the eyes"?

187
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,090
Dunno...

188
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,220
Please think of a way that we can meet without the police finding out.

189
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,130
Once we meet, we can confirm our identities by showing each other our Shinigami.

190
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,420
Once we meet, we can confirm our identities by showing each other our Shinigami.

191
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,990
Shinigami?!

192
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,450
This person is hopeless... If I don't do something fast...

193
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,640
This person is hopeless... If I don't do something fast...

194
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,270
What?!

195
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,150
R-Ryuuzaki!!

196
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,350
R-Ryuuzaki!!

197
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,650
Are you okay?

198
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,160
S-Shinigami...

199
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,680
S-Shinigami...

200
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,130
Are you trying to tell me... that such things exist?!

201
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,340
Are you trying to tell me... that such things exist?!

202
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,000
S-Shinigami...

203
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,450
Are you trying to tell me.. that such things exist?!

204
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,400
Are you trying to tell me.. that such things exist?!

205
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,410
S-Surely not...

206
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,870
S-Surely not...

207
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,270
There's no way that they exist...

208
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,970
He's right, Ryuuzaki. There's no way that Shinigami actually exist.

209
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,450
He's right, Ryuuzaki. There's no way that Shinigami actually exist.

210
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,290
Kira used prisoners to write sentences about Shinigami...

211
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,980
If that's true, shouldn't we consider this to be the work of the original Kira?

212
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,050
If that's true, shouldn't we consider this to be the work of the original Kira?

213
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,600
The same words from the same person?

214
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,880
I doubt that, father.

215
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,260
The Kira we have dealt with until now wouldn't have replied to our video.

216
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:51,330
The real Kira wouldn't have bought this story. And they wouldn't have prevented L from going on TV to be killed.

217
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,340
Then, is there a possibility that the real Kira and the second Kira may already have joined forces, and are using the term "Shinigami" to confuse our investigation?

218
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,560
Then, is there a possibility that the real Kira and the second Kira may already have joined forces, and are using the term "Shinigami" to confuse our investigation?

219
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,430
Then, is there a possibility that the real Kira and the second Kira may already have joined forces, and are using the term "Shinigami" to confuse our investigation?

220
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,370
I don't think there's any chance of that happening.

221
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,900
Light-kun is correct. If Kira is involved, I doubt that they'd stop trying to kill me.

222
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,950
Light-kun is correct. If Kira is involved, I doubt that they'd stop trying to kill me.

223
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,660
This second Kira appears to be acting on their own interests, rather than Kira's beliefs.

224
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,540
Basically, their desire to meet Kira.

225
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,070
Basically, their desire to meet Kira.

226
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,630
Exactly.

227
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,180
They are acting on their own curiosity about Kira.

228
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,710
Perhaps "Shinigami" is referring to their ability to kill.

229
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:36,810
"Confirm our identities by showing each other our Shinigami", could mean that they'll confirm each other's identity by demonstrating their ability to kill.

230
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,340
You could be right...

231
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:49,180
At the very least, we can consider "Shinigami" as a common term of some significance between Kira and the second Kira.

232
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,300
We need to try to clarify that.

233
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,280
So, will we reply again to guide them?

234
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,060
If we probe too deeply, they may realize that we know nothing, and that we aren't really Kira.

235
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,800
If we probe too deeply, they may realize that we know nothing, and that we aren't really Kira.

236
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,870
No. From now on, we'll leave it to Kira and the second Kira.

237
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,680
No. From now on, we'll leave it to Kira and the second Kira.

238
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,300
Leave it to them?

239
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,430
I assume that having received a reply from Kira, the second Kira is now content about the current situation.

240
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,200
I assume that having received a reply from Kira, the second Kira is now content about the current situation.

241
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,670
They believe that they've successfully appealed to Kira.

242
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,990
Plus, they are using words that only they would know the significance of.

243
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,470
We'll repeat this reply on the 6:00pm news on Sakura TV.

244
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:36,250
The real Kira will be watching to view the interaction between the second Kira and the fake Kira that we've created.

245
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:42,800
The real Kira would want to avoid any contact between the second Kira and the police.

246
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,560
If we're lucky, we'll get a response from the real Kira this time.

247
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,940
If we're lucky, we'll get a response from the real Kira this time.

248
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,220
But what if we don't receive a response from Kira?

249
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,100
Well... I've tried to think of what the second Kira would do in this situation, and...

250
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,400
Well... I've tried to think of what the second Kira would do in this situation, and...

251
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,740
they would probably tell the police and the public further information that Kira would not want them to know,

252
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,320
to force Kira to seek an audience with them!

253
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,510
This could be very interesting!

254
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:16,150
It'll be even more interesting if Kira does fear such a response, and sends their own message by video.

255
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,710
If that does happen, we'll have more physical evidence against Kira.

256
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,970
Then, for the time being, let us pursue the second Kira.

257
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,350
Then, for the time being, let us pursue the second Kira.

258
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,560
That's good.

259
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,890
That's it, that's it!

260
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,480
That's good. That's so hot, Misa-chan!

261
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,310
Brilliant!

262
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,210
I'm so tired... Being a model is all about having stamina.

263
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,790
I'm so tired... Being a model is all about having stamina.

264
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,990
Hey, Rem?

265
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,450
Can I ask you something?

266
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,720
What is it?

267
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,830
Shinigami need to have a Death Note.

268
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,110
For Shinigami to play with humans, they need to have two.

269
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,300
The Shinigami, Ryuk, who gave a notebook to Kira, tricked the Shinigami Overlord and got a second notebook, right?

270
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,380
The Shinigami, Ryuk, who gave a notebook to Kira, tricked the Shinigami Overlord and got a second notebook, right?

271
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,300
That's right.

272
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,550
Did you do that too?

273
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,480
No. The Shinigami Overlord isn't that easy to trick.

274
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,610
No. The Shinigami Overlord isn't that easy to trick.

275
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,310
So, how did you manage it?

276
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,320
I'm rare in the Shinigami world.

277
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,010
I'm one of the few who actually knows how to kill a Shinigami.

278
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,030
Let's leave it at that.

279
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,270
So, you killed a Shinigami, and gave Misa their notebook?

280
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,690
No... I didn't kill them.

281
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,690
No... I didn't kill them.

282
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,910
I just happened to be there when a Shinigami died.

283
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,670
Hey, tell me how to kill a Shinigami!

284
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,000
Hey, tell me how to kill a Shinigami!

285
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,550
You mustn't tell anyone.

286
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,760
The way to kill a Shinigami is... to make them fall in love with a human.

287
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,520
The way to kill a Shinigami is... to make them fall in love with a human.

288
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,810
What a beautiful way to kill someone.

289
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:19,000
There was once a Shinigami named Jealous, who used to constantly gaze at one particular girl from his place in the Shinigami world.

290
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,060
From the Shinigami world, Jealous was always, always, watching that girl.

291
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,870
It's today, isn't it? That girl's life runs out...

292
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,350
It's today, isn't it? That girl's life runs out...

293
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,410
She seems so full of life... I wonder why it's today...

294
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,740
She seems so full of life... I wonder why it's today...

295
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,850
I wonder... why today?

296
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,250
I wonder... why today?

297
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,510
I also became curious as to how she would die, so I chose to watch with him.

298
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,010
I also became curious as to how she would die, so I chose to watch with him.

299
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,560
She was walking alone late at night... and then.. suddenly a man appeared from an alley, and confessed his love for the girl.

300
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,420
She was walking alone late at night... and then.. suddenly a man appeared from an alley, and confessed his love for the girl.

301
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,690
She was walking alone late at night... and then.. suddenly a man appeared from an alley, and confessed his love for the girl.

302
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,950
I love you more than anyone in this world!!

303
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,740
I want to watch over, and protect you forever!!

304
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,860
The girl, having never seen the man before, naturally refused him.

305
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,310
The girl, having never seen the man before, naturally refused him.

306
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,830
Then... I'll kill you... before killing myself!

307
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,990
Then... I'll kill you... before killing myself!

308
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,570
Then... I'll kill you... before killing myself!

309
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,420
Hey! Stop that!!

310
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,090
Hey! Stop that!!

311
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,770
Jealous did something that no Shinigami should ever do.

312
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,200
Jealous used his Death Note to save that girl...

313
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,010
But that is not allowed.

314
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:26,080
Shinigami exist solely to take human lives in order to increase their own.

315
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,680
At that moment, Jealous turned into sand, or rust... something I couldn't identify... and died.

316
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,030
At that moment, Jealous turned into sand, or rust... something I couldn't identify... and died.

317
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,760
At that moment, Jealous turned into sand, or rust... something I couldn't identify... and died.

318
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,640
All that remained was the Death Note.

319
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:05,550
Jealous's life was added to the lifespan of the girl he had been watching.

320
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,850
If he wasn't in love with that girl, he wouldn't have died?

321
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,740
If he wasn't in love with that girl, he wouldn't have died?

322
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,020
That's right.

323
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,160
So, the person... who helped me back then... was Jealous, the Shinigami.

324
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,320
So, the person... who helped me back then... was Jealous, the Shinigami.

325
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,480
So, the person... who helped me back then... was Jealous, the Shinigami.

326
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,140
Correct.

327
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,330
Jealous was in love with you.

328
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,520
That's why that notebook is yours.

329
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,250
I see. You've got to make a Shinigami fall in love and help someone.

330
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,350
I see. You've got to make a Shinigami fall in love and help someone.

331
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,960
What about you Rem? You aren't falling for me, are you?

332
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,400
What about you Rem? You aren't falling for me, are you?

333
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,920
Give it up. You can't kill me.

334
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,420
Give it up. You can't kill me.

335
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,750
Oh, so you guessed it?

336
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,740
Oh, so you guessed it?

337
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,150
But now I have something else I can tell Kira!

338
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,590
I wonder if they know how-to-kill-a-Shinigami?

339
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,920
I wonder if they know how-to-kill-a-Shinigami?

340
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,400
I wonder if they know how-to-kill-a-Shinigami?

341
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,880
I wonder if they know how-to-kill-a-Shinigami?

342
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,390
I wonder if they know how-to-kill-a-Shinigami?

343
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,060
I wonder if they know how-to-kill-a-Shinigami?

344
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,540
I told them on TV to think up a good way for us to meet each other, but I still haven't had a response...

345
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,330
Maybe I should say something again!

346
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,820
This isn't good... There's no way I can leave the second Kira to their own devices.

347
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,740
This isn't good... There's no way I can leave the second Kira to their own devices.

348
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,670
If the second Kira makes a critical error, and gets captured by the police, there's a chance that they could find out about the Death Note.

349
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,860
If the second Kira makes a critical error, and gets captured by the police, there's a chance that they could find out about the Death Note.

350
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,710
If the second Kira makes a critical error, and gets captured by the police, there's a chance that they could find out about the Death Note.

351
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,010
Welcome.

352
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,430
A strawberry sundae please!

353
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,000
Coming right up.

354
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,660
But how.. should I contact the second Kira without L noticing...

355
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,150
But how.. should I contact the second Kira without L noticing...

356
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,730
Sorry for the delay.

357
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,990
I can't wait to meet Kira!

358
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,000
Still... I wonder what they're like... fake Kira...

359
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,930
Still... I wonder what they're like... fake Kira...

360
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,120
Still... I wonder what they're like... fake Kira...

361
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,780
I wonder what they're like... Kira!

362
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,010
I wonder what they're like... Kira!

363
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,050
To be continued

364
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,370
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

365
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,370
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

366
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,500
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

367
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,500
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

368
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:39,280
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

369
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:39,280
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

370
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:46,060
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

371
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:46,060
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

372
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,130
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

373
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,130
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

374
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,270
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

375
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,270
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

376
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:03,920
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

377
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:03,920
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

378
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,080
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

379
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,080
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

380
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,560
Samazama na negative ni

381
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm not so weak,

382
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,890
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

383
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,890
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

384
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,750
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

385
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,750
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

386
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,620
Preview

387
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,990
May 22nd: At Aoyama, we looked at each other's notebooks.

388
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,150
May 22nd: At Aoyama, we looked at each other's notebooks.

389
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:42,170
If the second Kira gets caught, at the very least, I've got to get their notebook, and in the worst case scenario, kill anyone that happens to be there.

390
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,090
Next time

391
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,090
Confessions
