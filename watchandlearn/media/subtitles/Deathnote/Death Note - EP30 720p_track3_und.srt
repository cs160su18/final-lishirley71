WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,580
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,500
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

91
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,590
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,580
Near, isn't it about time you tell me your thoughts regarding all this?

93
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,900
Given the rather "convenient" interaction between Kira and the Japanese police during this incident,

94
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,570
at the very least, I can conclude that Kira and the Japanese police are working together.

95
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,860
"Working together"?!

96
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,400
And if that's true, then Kira is... the second-generation L.

97
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,210
And if that's true, then Kira is... the second-generation L.

98
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:44,730
I-It can't be...

99
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,860
I-It can't be...

100
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,240
Are you serious?!

101
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,250
Near!

102
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,580
Yes, but I'm only around 7% certain.

103
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,090
Yes, but I'm only around 7% certain.

104
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,020
Commander Lester, when investigating, once you've decided on something,

105
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,640
you must believe in it absolutely, and if you're wrong, then "sorry" should suffice.

106
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Justice

107
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:18,820
"Recently, crime has decreased in Japan, because if you do something bad, your name will be put on the Internet, and you'll be killed by Kira.

108
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,820
Name?

109
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,400
That's what my dad says."

110
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,600
Unless you give me your name, we can't file a record.

111
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,160
H-Have mercy! Anything but my name!

112
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,170
I'll expose all your names on the Internet!

113
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:39,130
Kira-sama, please kill me

114
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,410
I want to announce, here and now, that Kira is Justice!

115
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,790
Kira's Realm

116
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:15,540
It's an undeniable fact that I've been appointed by Kira to be their spokesman.

117
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,300
There may be those who'll attempt to take my life...

118
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:27,970
But I'm prepared to lay down my life in order to bring you the words of Kira!

119
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,760
New Japanese Investigative Headquarters

120
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,060
"Kira's Realm"?

121
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,620
What a distasteful title...

122
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,970
What's this world turning into?

123
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,900
Investigating Kira is an inexcusable thing! I'll even go as far as saying that it's a crime!

124
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,980
We'd really be better off if they killed this guy...

125
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:42,070
The police, members of the public, criminals... whoever's investigating Kira, report them!

126
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,500
Well, it's time for the President's press conference.

127
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,970
I wonder what's happening? They said it's going to be a "message to the world"...

128
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,820
I wonder what's happening? They said it's going to be a "message to the world"...

129
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,100
All you lot seem to do is watch TV.

130
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,660
We, the United States of America...

131
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,800
Don't tell me...

132
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,680
...hereby acknowledge Kira and will not oppose them.

133
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,140
Goddamn it!

134
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,640
Success!

135
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,270
Even America is finally accepting Kira.

136
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,100
W-What the hell is he saying?!

137
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,920
W-What the hell is he saying?!

138
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,530
Do they fear Kira?!

139
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,180
Mr. President!

140
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,530
Explain yourself!

141
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,010
When was this decision made?!

142
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,360
Can you give us more details?!

143
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,460
Are you saying that Kira is Justice?!

144
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,460
"Justice"? I'm not saying that.

145
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,650
But, it's a fact that thanks to Kira's powers, war has ceased.

146
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,380
Organized crime, and not just in our own country, has also been obliterated.

147
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,360
If we openly oppose Kira, we will be killed. That much is certain.

148
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,210
So, while we won't acknowledge them as justice, we'll no longer take any measures to try and catch Kira.

149
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,850
Isn't that the same thing?!

150
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,060
Didn't you just say that you acknowledge Kira?!

151
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,400
Explain yourself!

152
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,290
Are you running away?!

153
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,060
And you call yourself this country's representative?!

154
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,410
I can't believe this... this is America we're talking about... and that was a presidential statement!

155
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,650
I can't believe this... this is America we're talking about... and that was a presidential statement!

156
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,490
I can't believe this... this is America we're talking about... and that was a presidential statement!

157
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,450
Um, can I be serious for a moment?

158
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,340
What's with the sudden change?

159
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,070
So, you normally aren't serious?

160
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,080
Do you really believe, from the depths of your heart, that Kira is evil?

161
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,090
What?!

162
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,290
What do you mean, Matsuda?!

163
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,800
To be honest... I just can't believe that they're completely evil.

164
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,420
To be honest... I just can't believe that they're completely evil.

165
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,920
You believe that Kira is Justice?

166
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,470
I don't know...

167
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,010
But I believe that Kira is fighting against evil.

168
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,480
It's also an undeniable fact that the world has become a better place for those who live honest lives.

169
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,380
You're wrong, Matsuda!

170
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,270
This is all just build on the fear of being slaughtered. This isn't real peace.

171
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,650
I know! I know that much, but... I also understand the feelings of those who proclaim Kira to be their savior.

172
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,400
I know! I know that much, but... I also understand the feelings of those who proclaim Kira to be their savior.

173
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,940
I know! I know that much, but... I also understand the feelings of those who proclaim Kira to be their savior.

174
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,850
I've always been in a weak position...

175
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,580
But I'm a cop! I can't acknowledge Kira.

176
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,450
But I'm a cop! I can't acknowledge Kira.

177
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,900
I know that, and I want to catch them, because it's my job.

178
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,540
I've got to be crazy doing this without even being able to fully oppose Kira.

179
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,140
I don't think that is crazy, Matsuda-san.

180
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,640
What are you saying?! Even you, Light?!

181
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,680
Even Kira must realize that what they're doing is evil; yet, they've still decided to sacrifice themselves to change the world.

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,280
Even Kira must realize that what they're doing is evil; yet, they've still decided to sacrifice themselves to change the world.

183
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,320
That's the type of justice Kira has chosen.

184
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,340
I'm assuming that's what Kira probably is thinking.

185
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,880
But it's not our job to decide whether Kira is good or evil.

186
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,790
We only have to catch Kira.

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,500
If we catch Kira, then Kira is evil.

188
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,040
If Kira takes control of the world, then Kira is Justice.

189
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,470
However, henceforth, things will accelerate and the world will rapidly turn toward Kira.

190
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,060
Kira will definitely become Justice.

191
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,770
What's going to happen to us now?

192
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,020
I guess we'll have to disband. Thanks to that chicken of a president.

193
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,030
No... he's not even a chicken. He's lower than a maggot.

194
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,020
This isn't a joke. There's no way acknowledging Kira is the right thing to do.

195
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,980
You're alive?!

196
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,120
Near!

197
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,220
What should we do?

198
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,160
Let them in.

199
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,060
Mello... welcome.

200
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,920
Mello... welcome.

201
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,220
Put the gun down!

202
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,090
Everyone, please lower your guns.

203
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,290
Shedding blood here will only be a waste of our time.

204
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,720
But he killed our colleagues!

205
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,330
Please don't make me say this again and again; or objective is to capture Kira.

206
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,660
Killing Mello now would achieve nothing.

207
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,120
Okay...

208
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,260
Has this gone exactly as you expected it to so far, Near?

209
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,990
Yes. You must have heard it from Lidner... about what happened with the second-generation L.

210
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,820
Yes. You must have heard it from Lidner... about what happened with the second-generation L.

211
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,800
Yes. You must have heard it from Lidner... about what happened with the second-generation L.

212
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,130
Thanks to everything you've done, I've been able to narrow down Kira quite a bit.

213
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,760
Near!!

214
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,810
I'm not a device for you to solve your puzzles with!

215
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,480
Mello, if you want to shoot me, go ahead.

216
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,240
Mello! If you shoot Near, we'll have no choice but to shoot you.

217
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,370
Mello! If you shoot Near, we'll have no choice but to shoot you.

218
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,680
Mello! If you shoot Near, we'll have no choice but to shoot you.

219
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,050
If you both die here, what will that achieve?

220
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,660
It'll only make Kira happy!

221
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,020
You're right. Near, I only came to get back that photo you have of me.

222
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,170
You're right. Near, I only came to get back that photo you have of me.

223
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,000
Alright. This is the only photo... there are no copies.

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,890
Alright. This is the only photo... there are no copies.

225
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,010
Alright. This is the only photo... there are no copies.

226
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,970
I've dealt with anyone who would have known your face, at Wammy's House and elsewhere.

227
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,480
I can't say this with 100% certainty, but you won't be killed with that notebook.

228
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,690
Is that all you wanted, Mello?

229
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,500
Near...

230
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,040
I have no intention of cooperating with you.

231
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,380
I know that.

232
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,280
But... it'd be annoying to leave here with only this photo to show for it.

233
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,380
But... it'd be annoying to leave here with only this photo to show for it.

234
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,880
The murderer's notebook... it's a Shinigami's notebook.

235
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,640
The murderer's notebook... it's a Shinigami's notebook.

236
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,730
Those who have the notebook can see the Shinigami.

237
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,850
Bullshit!

238
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,810
Who the hell is going to believe that?

239
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,820
I'll believe it.

240
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,460
What can Mello achieve by lying about that?

241
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,890
If he was going to lie, he'd lie about something more meaningful.

242
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,780
Therefore, Shinigami exist.

243
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,680
The notebook I had was once in the possession of someone other than a Shinigami.

244
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,880
And at least one of the rules written in there is fake.

245
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,880
That's about as much as I can tell you.

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,240
Near...

247
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,100
Mello...

248
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,820
Which of us will catch Kira first...

249
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,010
It's a race, huh?

250
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,260
We're both heading toward the same goal. I'll be there waiting for you.

251
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,480
We're both heading toward the same goal. I'll be there waiting for you.

252
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,900
Fine.

253
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,020
A fake rule...

254
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,480
Given what's already happened, things such as heart attacks and being able to manipulate people before their deaths must be true.

255
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,680
"Burning or shredding the notebook"? The notebooks still exist and there's no way to test that.

256
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,320
"Burning or shredding the notebook"? The notebooks still exist and there's no way to test that.

257
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,070
Which means...

258
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,290
The fake rule must be the one that states you'll die unless you write a name in the notebook within 13 days of the last.

259
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,260
Gevanni, get me L.

260
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,570
Of course.

261
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,890
It's Near!

262
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,180
Yes?

263
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,110
L, we caught Mello... but he got away.

264
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,140
However, I was able to question him a little.

265
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,800
So, you mean he didn't get away, you "allowed him" to get away? Am I right?

266
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,710
So, you mean he didn't get away, you "allowed him" to get away? Am I right?

267
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,960
So, you mean he didn't get away, you "allowed him" to get away? Am I right?

268
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,780
No, he really did get away.

269
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,660
Incidentally, he mentioned that that notebook was bound to a Shinigami.

270
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,360
Have you been able to verify the existence of such a being?

271
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,220
Yes. Shinigami do in fact exist.

272
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,570
I thought you wouldn't believe me even if I told you, so I never said anything.

273
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,120
There are a lot of things I'd like to ask that Shinigami.

274
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,180
I don't wanna be asked.

275
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:16,310
What bothers me the most are the rules written in the notebook, and the fact that there may be a fake rule.

276
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,660
There's a fake?

277
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,230
Yes.

278
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,640
L, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. If there was a fake rule, which would it be?

279
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,380
L, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. If there was a fake rule, which would it be?

280
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,070
L, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. If there was a fake rule, which would it be?

281
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:37,300
By the process of elimination, it would have to be the one that says you'll die if you don't write a name within 13 days of the last.

282
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,220
So, you think that after all... so do I.

283
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,840
So, you think that after all... so do I.

284
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,600
Shinigami, were there any fake rules written in the notebook?

285
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,140
Nope. There weren't.

286
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,100
There's a Shinigami with you, isn't there?

287
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,340
Yes.

288
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,330
Oh, really? I think I'm beginning to understand this now.

289
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,990
Kira is there, and is telling the Shinigami to lie.

290
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,180
This dude is amazing. He's spot on!

291
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:16,020
Even if there was a fake, and the Shinigami is lying, it doesn't mean anything, does it?

292
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,420
No, it would make Light's detainment pointless as well.

293
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,420
If it's not true that you need to continue to write in the notebook to stay alive,

294
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,510
then there's no meaning to the fact that he did nothing for 13 days.

295
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,320
T-That's different. There's no way Light-kun could be Kira.

296
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,900
T-That's different. There's no way Light-kun could be Kira.

297
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,560
T-That's different. There's no way Light-kun could be Kira.

298
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,480
Before he died, the Deputy Chief himself confirmed that Light-kun doesn't have a notebook.

299
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,820
In that case, how about we verify it like this?

300
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,200
I will write Mello's name in the notebook.

301
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,440
Then if I die 13 days after Mello, Kira wins. I don't care.

302
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,560
Then if I die 13 days after Mello, Kira wins. I don't care.

303
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,730
Then if I die 13 days after Mello, Kira wins. I don't care.

304
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,340
W-What? This is about winning and losing now?!

305
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,140
W-What? This is about winning and losing now?!

306
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,380
W-What? This is about winning and losing now?!

307
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,900
Verifying the "13 days" rule can only be a positive thing for the Kira investigation. There are no negatives.

308
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,430
Please allow me to lay down my life for this.

309
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:22,700
If I'm the only one to reject this idea, what sort of impression will that give the others?

310
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,230
Please give us a while. We'll need to review this proposal.

311
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,210
I'd like everyone to give me their honest opinions.

312
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,980
"We can't do this out of respect for human life"...

313
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,660
That's easy for me to say, but I was the one detained, and it'll sound suspicious coming from me.

314
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,750
It's strange. Killing Mello would avenge the Deputy Chief, so if Near wants to do that, I'm inclined to let him.

315
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,040
I'm against it.

316
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,760
I believe that no one here is Kira, and ultimately, killing people with the notebook is not something we should be doing.

317
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,760
Yeah, we should try to follow in the Deputy Chief's footsteps.

318
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,520
I'm also against the idea of verifying it.

319
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,490
Near, there's no way we can go ahead with verifying the notebook.

320
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,780
As I thought... Lastly, let me ask you one more thing.

321
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,980
As I thought... Lastly, let me ask you one more thing.

322
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,410
To all of you at the Japanese Investigative Headquarters... have you ever thought, even once, that your "second-generation" L might be Kira?

323
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,180
To all of you at the Japanese Investigative Headquarters... have you ever thought, even once, that your "second-generation" L might be Kira?

324
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,660
To all of you at the Japanese Investigative Headquarters... have you ever thought, even once, that your "second-generation" L might be Kira?

325
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,170
If there's anyone there who, having heard the conversation up to this point, is willing to cooperate with my investigation in any way,

326
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,380
then ring the number I'm about to give you.

327
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,020
You'll be able to reach me.

328
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,550
Light-kun can't be Kira. No, I don't even want to think that!

329
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,420
Light-kun can't be Kira. No, I don't even want to think that!

330
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,240
Light-kun can't be Kira. No, I don't even want to think that!

331
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,440
But if the "13 days" rule is fake, he's not completely above suspicion.

332
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,000
Near... I've got no choice now but to kill you!

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,360
Near... I've got no choice now but to kill you!

334
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,560
It's me.

335
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,370
This is Kira.

336
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,290
I-Is this some kind of joke?!

337
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,900
I-Is this some kind of joke?!

338
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,300
I'll let you decide when you compare tomorrow's events with the death list I'm about to read you.

339
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:21,010
Mr. President, first, I'd like to thank you deeply for your approval of me.

340
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,080
However, that's not enough.

341
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,570
I would like you to bring a swift end to the actions of the SPK, the organization out to get Kira, by ordering their dissolution.

342
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,950
Additionally, I would like you to use the police force, CIA,

343
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:44,480
FBI, and any other secret organizations to determine the whereabouts of the SPK members.

344
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,840
And when you uncover them, I would like you to tell me immediately via a communication point that I'll specify later.

345
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,400
Mr. President, whether you live a long life or not, is up to you.

346
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Please remember that.

347
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,280
Understood.

348
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,560
Demegawa-san! Please wait!

349
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,140
Why are you going to New York all of a sudden?

350
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,340
I'm going to crush an organization that dares to oppose Kira-sama!

351
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,620
A live report!

352
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,140
The President dropped me a line under orders from Kira!

353
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,250
Even I don't know what's going on, and I don't even care!

354
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,740
Our viewing figures are going to go up by 100... no, 120%!

355
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,430
Now, everyone, the age of Kira is upon us!

356
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,850
The previous L suspected Light-kun too.

357
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:58,860
But if I was to suggest the need to investigate him again, then if he really is Kira, I'll just be killed.

358
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,220
"13 days" rule, eh?

359
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,690
Aizawa, we've known each other for a long time now... I know what's worrying you.

360
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,180
Aizawa, we've known each other for a long time now... I know what's worrying you.

361
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,010
Aizawa, we've known each other for a long time now... I know what's worrying you.

362
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,880
You've got to do what you believe in.

363
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,370
I never fully trusted L.

364
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:22,850
Even now I'm doing this because I want to work with you, not Light-kun.

365
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,220
Ide...

366
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,180
I'll contact Near without Light-kun finding out.

367
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,160
Got it.

368
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,010
No matter what you do, I'll ensure that no one finds out.

369
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,750
Light-kun... you're not Kira...

370
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,380
Light-kun... you're not Kira...

371
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,840
I want to believe that...

372
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,020
This is terrible! Live on TV, Demegawa's...

373
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:17,420
I, Demegawa, have finally tracked down the base of an evil organization that seeks to capture our God, Kira!

374
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,150
And along with my brothers, we have them surrounded!

375
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,000
Currently, they appear to be hiding in this building!

376
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,060
Witness the power of the people!

377
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,000
The power of Justice!!

378
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,300
When Near comes running out, I'll write his name in the notebook.

379
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,760
Light! Misa will give it her best!!

380
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:50,170
Near... at this rate we really will get dragged out of here...

381
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,350
L...

382
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,620
What's the matter, Near?

383
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,360
Is this one of Mello's plans to destroy the SPK?

384
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,860
Or does the SPK operate in such ways that allow even members of the public to track down their location?

385
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,870
You... how dare you lie to me so blatantly?

386
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,580
You... how dare you lie to me so blatantly?

387
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,830
I win, Near.

388
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
To be continued

389
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,410
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

390
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,410
This one page of everlasting depression;

391
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

392
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
hakanai senpou sono meni

393
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,270
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

394
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,270
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

395

Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

396
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,850
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

397
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,500
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

398
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,500
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

399
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,350
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

400
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,350
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

401
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,790
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

402
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,790
Who would know of a path to salvation?

403
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,640
Menzai no waarudo

404
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,640
World of acquittal,

405
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,470
words of retribution!

406
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,470
seisai no waado

407
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,210
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

408
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,210
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

409
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,200
Redeem the game of law!

410
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,200
Aganau houritsu geemu

Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

Come, relentless eraser rain.

417
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,550
Despair the Billy,

418
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,550
Zetsubou za birii

here are the morals!

421
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,890
Come, relentless eraser rain.

relentless eraser rain.

Preview

426
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,800
As I thought! I can really use him!

427
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,580
Someone who genuinely worships Kira, a man who can understand, just by being given the notebook, that they are the chosen one.

428
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,540
There were no mistakes in my plan.

429
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,960
Next Time

430
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,960
