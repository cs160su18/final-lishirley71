00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,140
Near, it went smoothly.

95
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,130
I have done what you told me to do.

96
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,810
Yes.

97
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,040
T, that's all for today.

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,100
T, that's all for today.

99
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,990
I have received all the messages.

100
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,180
I also have one thing to say.

101
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,840
Yes?

102
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,090
I have confirmed it.

103
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,070
Ah? An email?

104
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,300
Ah? An email?

105
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,240
Ah, she wants to meet you she says.

106
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,440
I'm so envious of you!

107
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,670
Yes! That's to say that Mikami has confirmed it!

108
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,950
Yes! That's to say that Mikami has confirmed it!

109
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,720
All I need to do now is to wait for Near to request a meeting.

110
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,620
Near, this is my victory.

111
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,460
Near, this is my victory.

112
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,090
I have predicted how you are going to move very well.

113
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,390
This is Gevanni.

114
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,550
Near, I have checked the notebook and confirm it.

115
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,400
Mikami has written down a page per day for the last three days.

116
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,520
The names on them match the victims. Mikami did not act differently as well.

117
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,220
Understood. Well then, let's start.

118
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,360
Understood. Well then, let's start.

119
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,340
Ah, it's Near.

120
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,020
Here it comes!

121
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,410
L.

122
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,910
What is it, Near?

123
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,990
I want to meet you.

124
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,950
What?

125
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,030
I have something I want to show you regarding the Kira Incident.

126
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,550
But wasn't I regarded as Kira by you? You should not want to reveal to me what you look like.

127
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,410
But wasn't I regarded as Kira by you? You should not want to reveal to me what you look like.

128
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,530
No, I have to reveal my face to show you what I want to.

129
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,500
And, by revealing my face, I can reveal something to you as well.

130
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,540
With that, we will be able to put an end to this.

131
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,320
That's fine then.

132
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,480
I want to put an end to this wrong idea you have of me quickly as well.

133
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,490
Near is doing this to show that Light is Kira.

134
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,450
If Light is Kira, he will be doing this to kill Near.

135
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,770
That will be the time...

136
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,680
And before that, I would like to make an agreement with you.

137
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,120
Yes. Just spell out whatever requests you have.

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,270
First of all, all members from each team are to attend this meeting.

139
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,340
Meaning, we will gather everyone who is after Kira at that moment.

140
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,100
I see. That will be fine.

141
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,310
From my side, it will be like I told you. Four people including myself.

142
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,140
That will make up the whole SPK team.

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:28,110
And as for the abducted Mr. Mogi, we will bring him along, while releasing Amane without revealing where we are going.

144
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,410
You can confirm our release of Amane before moving.

145
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,740
How is that?

146
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,020
What should we do?

147
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,490
Near. Roger that. With me included, we have a team of five over here.

148
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,950
Near. Roger that. With me included, we have a team of five over here.

149
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,830
Near. Roger that. With me included, we have a team of five over here.

150
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,740
No... with Mogi-san with you, I have only three other people with me.

151
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,160
No... with Mogi-san with you, I have only three other people with me.

152
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,790
Understood. Well then, next will be deciding our meeting place.

153
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,680
Understood. Well then, next will be deciding our meeting place.

154
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,760
There's a Daikoku Wharf at the Southeast area. At the moment, it is not being used.

155
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,770
It is a place also known as "Yellow Box".

156
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,110
If this is good enough, we will proceed with the meeting.

157
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,640
How is that, Yagami Light?

158
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,800
With that, you should be able to do what you want to do as well.

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,000
One more thing. I would like someone in the investigation team to bring the notebook.

160
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,850
Why the notebook?

161
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,500
That's simple.

162
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,510
If all of you came over to meet me, there will be no one keeping guard on the notebook.

163
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,640
I can promise you this.

164
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,700
I will not attempt to take the notebook away.

165
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,860
To confirm that you are bringing the real one, and are indeed from the team,

166
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,190
I will just need Mr. Aizawa's confirmation, and I will believe in that.

167
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,510
I get it.

168
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,480
But, please make sure someone other than L is carrying it.

169
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,480
I still think that L is Kira.

170
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,820
I get it, but I will get to choose who carries it. Will that be fine?

171
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,960
I get it, but I will get to choose who carries it. Will that be fine?

172
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,140
I get it, but I will get to choose who carries it. Will that be fine?

173
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,540
Yes.

174
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,580
Then, we are only left with the day and date.

175
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,960
The day and date? Time is the important factor here.

176
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,950
If Mikami is doing his judgment from midnight, he must have picked out his targets during the day.

177
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,700
If Mikami is doing his judgment from midnight, he must have picked out his targets during the day.

178
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,090
If we take this time into consideration...

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,720
3 days after today, on the 28th, at 1pm. How is that?

180
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,970
1pm? That's the time I expected.

181
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,580
1pm? That's the time I expected.

182
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,690
Near knows how Mikami work.

183
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,690
Understood. On our side, any time is good.

184
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,200
Then, 3 days later at 1pm.

185
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,700
Yes.

186
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,620
Near!

187
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,910
Yagami Light!

188
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,290
I have predicted and read your moves. I am definitely going to win!

189
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,430
Takada-san, I'm sorry.

190
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,640
I am quite busy today...

191
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,070
Busy?

192
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,960
Are you saying you're not staying until the morning?

193
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Yeah, I'm sorry.

194
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,100
My hands will be full over the next 2 to 3 days with police work.

195
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,990
What a pity...

196
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,190
Mikami and Takada have already been instructed on what to do.

197
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,020
This is the last instruction to kill Near.

198
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,350
Smoke? There's an attacker!

199
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,160
Takada-sama, are you okay?

200
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,630
Yes.

201
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,030
He's getting away! After him!

202
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,040
Takada-sama, let's get into NHN quickly.

203
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,140
Don't do that! With this kind of attack, it will be dangerous inside NHN!

204
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,680
Mello!

205
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,770
For the time being, it's better to get away from here.

206
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,230
Takada-sama, please get on the bike.

207
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,480
Quick!

208
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,420
Takada-sama, it's alright.

209
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,900
Get on the bike and get away...

210
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,710
Yes.

211
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:49,420
A team and B team, stay around Takada-sama. Other teams, please go after the attacker in the car just now.

212
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,300
Yosh, I have confirmed her safety.

213
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,770
Please help Takada-sama into the number 7 car.

214
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,730
This cannot be...! Takada-sama is...!

215
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,420
Damn!!

216
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,440
Idiots! Stop that!

217
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,950
What if you hit Takada-sama?

218
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,800
What are you doing?

219
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,510
One of the attackers is armed with various weapons.

220
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,810
The Takada Guard Team and the police are doing their best to find out where she is.

221
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
T-This is bad!

222
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,880
T-This is bad!

223
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,690
Is it Near again?

224
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,900
Near... He had arranged for us to meet in 3 days.

225
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,800
Near... He had arranged for us to meet in 3 days.

226
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,540
What will he gain from something like this?

227
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,820
No, rather than saying Near is behind this...

228
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,450
It's Near!

229
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,480
Those guys have been waiting for me...

230
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,770
How many guards does Takada have?

231
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,690
Hey, hey! Since when is Japanese allowed to have possessions of those nice arms?

232
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:47,280
And besides, you want to know where my accomplice has taken Takada, right?

233
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,370
You can't possibly fire at--

234
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,760
What an idiot. It's not like you were going to tell us a thing.

235
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,250
Going against Kira-sama is definitely a crime punishable by death.

236
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,960
This person... is one of the people Yagami-kun told me to be especially careful of...

237
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,850
This person... is one of the people Yagami-kun told me to be especially careful of...

238
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,370
Mello! Mihael Keehl...

239
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,990
Mello! Mihael Keehl...

240
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,980
Take off everything you are wearing and put them in there.

241
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,780
Hurry up.

242
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,450
You can have this blanket.

243
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,600
L, this time, the abduction of Takada has nothing to do with me.

244
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,010
Is that so? If that's the case, Mello...

245
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,970
Is that so? If that's the case, Mello...

246
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:30,840
Yes. To tell you the truth, the guard that I sent has already confirmed it was done by Mello.

247
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,470
For the trouble my guard has caused, I'm sorry.

248
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,000
Near, if it's you, can you get through to Mello?

249
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,430
No, that is impossible.

250
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,340
Although I do have a way to do that, Mello will not respond at a time like this.

251
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,990
Before I take off my underwear, can you pass me the blanket?

252
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,570
Very well.

253
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,150
The Guard Team has taken down one of the accomplices of the kidnappers.

254
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,950
They are currently still tracking where Takada-sama is.

255
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,270
So, it was no use after all, Light?

256
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,530
Yes... Takada-san's phone is off.

257
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,370
Yes... Takada-san's phone is off.

258
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,750
With no way to get in contact with Takada, there's nothing other to do than to wait.

259
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,570
There is no other way than this. I have to be the one to do it!

260
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,470
There is no other way than this. I have to be the one to do it!

261
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,080
The identity of the man who was shot to death is still unknown.

262
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,850
Matt... I got you killed... sorry.

263
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,810
Matt... I got you killed... sorry.

264
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,550
Matt... I got you killed... sorry.

265
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,240
Light-kun!

266
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,000
It couldn't be!

267
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,940
Everyone, keep quiet!

268
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,150
Yes?

269
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,910
Yagami-kun, I...

270
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,120
Takada-san?

271
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,470
Takada-san, are you okay?

272
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,170
If she can contact me through her phone, that would mean... she's gotten away from Mello... or...

273
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,550
If she can contact me through her phone, that would mean... she's gotten away from Mello... or...

274
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,460
If she can contact me through her phone, that would mean... she's gotten away from Mello... or...

275
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,220
Yagami-kun! Help me!

276
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,430
Yagami-kun! Help me!

277
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,340
It's okay now. Calm down and answer my questions.

278
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,520
I understand.

279
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,990
First of all, the place. Do you know where you are right now?

280
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,510
First of all, the place. Do you know where you are right now?

281
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,180
I don't know where I am.

282
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,390
I am locked inside a truck.

283
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,710
When we were at the expressway, I did saw a signboard stating "Nagano". Right now, we're in some building...

284
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,760
When we were at the expressway, I did saw a signboard stating "Nagano". Right now, we're in some building...

285
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,910
Takada-san. You're Kira's spokeswoman. Do you remember how I told you the possibility that your life would be in danger?

286
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,080
Takada-san. You're Kira's spokeswoman. Do you remember how I told you the possibility that your life would be in danger?

287
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,650
Takada-san. You're Kira's spokeswoman. Do you remember how I told you the possibility that your life would be in danger?

288
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,960
Yes. I remember that.

289
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,210
In those situations, I told you what you are supposed to do. Do you remember them?

290
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,700
In those situations, I told you what you are supposed to do. Do you remember them?

291
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,040
In those situations, I told you what you are supposed to do. Do you remember them?

292
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,550
I remember.

293
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,640
The things that Yagami-kun told me to do...

294
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,550
I have done them.

295
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,220
Done them?

296
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:09,190
Even when I was stripped naked, I did not resist, but did what Yagami-kun said, and placed staying alive as my top priority...

297
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,940
I have done them all.

298
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,030
Yagami-kun, I have done everything you told me to.

299
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,570
Come quickly! Save me!

300
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,120
Takada-san, you know what to do from now, right?

301
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,260
To do as much judgment as possible...

302
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,500
I know that, but Yagami-kun...

303
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,250
I know that, but Yagami-kun...

304
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,250
Can you do it?

305
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,220
I can...

306
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,930
Aizawa-san, Ide-san, let's go.

307
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,810
Matsuda-san will stay watch in HQ.

308
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,290
Roger that.

309
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,960
It's me.

310
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,290
Do as much judgment as possible.

311
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,260
Yes... yes... I understand.

312
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,750
Yes... yes... I understand.

313
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,530
Yes... yes... I understand.

314
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,600
The fact that she is telling me this, means that she has taken out the kidnappers.

315
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,760
If that's the case, she must be in a state where she can't move around.

316
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,180
Nakajima-kun, I am going to the actual scene of the case.

317
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,520
Yes.

318
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,480
Step on it. I've gotten her location.

319
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,290
Get on the freeway and head towards Karuizawa.

320
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,040
So it's Karuizawa...

321
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,780
Damn... that will take at least 30 minutes.

322
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,690
Please hurry up.

323
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,310
It's Mello, and we don't know what he'll do.

324
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,450
Yes.

325
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,050
Well, well. Aizawa and Ide are still too careless.

326
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,310
Well, well. Aizawa and Ide are still too careless.

327
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,910
They just sat in the frontseats without me asking them to.

328
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,590
With that, I don't even have to do much.

329
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,980
This is...

330
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,390
Mello!

331
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,020
What's this?

332
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,990
Takada Kiyomi, suicide.

333
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,460
Takada Kiyomi, suicide.

334
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,610
On 26th January 2013, at 2:32pm, burnt all her belongings and anything written down before burning herself to death.

335
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:12,020
On 26th January 2013, at 2:32pm, burnt all her belongings and anything written down before burning herself to death.

336
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,000
To be continued

337
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,690
This one page of everlasting depression;

338
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,690
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

339
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,610
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

340
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,610
hakanai senpou sono meni

341
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,880
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

342
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,880
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

343
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,460
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

344
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,460
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

345
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,110
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

346
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,110
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

347
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,960
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

348
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,960
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

349
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,400
Who would know of a path to salvation?

350
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,400
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

351
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,250
World of acquittal,

352
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,250
Menzai no waarudo

353
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,080
seisai no waado

354
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,080
words of retribution!

355
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,820
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

356
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,820
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

357
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,810
Aganau houritsu geemu

358
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,810
Redeem the game of law!

359
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,840
Despair the Billy,

360
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,840
Zetsubou za birii

361
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,580
here are the morals!

362
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,580

363
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,200
Come, relentless eraser rain.

364
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,200
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

365

Zetsubou za birii

366
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,160
Despair the Billy,

367
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,870
iza rinri

368
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,870
here are the morals!

369
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,500
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

370
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,500
Come, relentless eraser rain.

371
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,120
relentless eraser rain.

372
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,120
tomerarenai eraser rain

373
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,780
Preview

374
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,610
With this, it's finished.

375
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,120
No... It starts from today.

376
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,010
The perfect world of Kira...

377
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,140
All who know of the notebook... will die!

378
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,000
All who know of the notebook... will die!

379
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,550
Next Time
