<i>The future that the forbidden fruit foretells.</i>

17

18
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,528
<i>I have to finish her off.</i>

19
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:48,465
What's wrong?

20
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:51,597
Oh, nothing...

21
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,969
I've been going over
what you just told me

22
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,639
and I think that we should investigate
that theory as soon as possible.

23
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:02,516
Really?

24
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:03,645
Yes.

25
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:05,813
Have you told this to anyone else?

26
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:08,312
No, you're the first.

27
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:11,620
You're lucky.

28
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:13,590
But how are you going to
rub her out?

29
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:15,720
Wouldn't it be bad
if you did it here?

30
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:19,329
<i>I've already figured that out.</i>
<i>without you telling me.</i>

31
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,069
Wow! So out in the open.

32
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:26,104
Could you tell me the date
and time of the bus jacking incident?

33
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:29,577
It was on December 20,
in front of Asagao Hill.

34
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,943
At 11:02.
Headed to Space Land.

35
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:39,486
December 20.
Headed to Space Land, right?

36
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:44,648
Shoko Maki
Suicide
January 1, 2007

37
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:48,492
Commits suicide in such a way
that nobody will be inconvenienced
and her body will not be discovered.
Dies by implementing this plan
within 48 hours.

38
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,658
<i>Now no one will find her body.</i>

39
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:54,633
<i>Even if they do find her,</i>

40
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:57,630
<i>they'll assume that she killed herself</i>
<i>because of her fiancé.</i>

41
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:03,377
<i>Ryuk, what's so funny?</i>

42
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:12,651
I'm very sorry for questioning
all of you individually.

43
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:15,555
Kira is not one of us.

44
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:21,089
Ryuzaki, how can you definitely
say that he's not among us?

45
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:26,762
To be honest, I set some traps
to check if you were Kira, but...

46
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,595
I didn't feel the need to
set them off on any of you.

47
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:35,408
Excuse me.

48
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:42,014
<i>After he told us to</i>
<i>turn off our cell phones..</i> <i>!

49
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:43,614
I got it.

50
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,384
I'm just about finished.

51
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,481
Enter with your own key.

52
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:50,951
Watari is coming.

53
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:53,858
I understand.

54
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,696
If it's all right, I'll report this incident.

55
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:02,060
No, I'd like to report it myself.

56
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,101
After talking to you, I've decided to
do it as soon as possible.

57
00:04:08,743 --> 00:04:09,732
I suppose you're right.

58
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:15,544
<i>Just ten seconds until 1:15.</i>

59
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:22,456
<i>I want to see how this woman dies,</i>
<i>but I can't be caught following her.</i>

60
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:27,857
<i>Now hurry to your death!</i>

61
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:43,776
Kira will definitely be caught, won't he?

62
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:45,169
<i>Huh?</i>

63
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:53,887
<i>What's wrong? Time is already up.</i>

64
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:58,256
<i>That's odd.</i>

65
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:00,519
<i>Why isn't this woman leaving?</i>

66
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:02,789
<i>My tests have proved that</i>

67
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:05,924
<i>I can make people kill themselves</i>
<i>by writing "suicide."</i>

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>The criminals I tested all hanged</i>
<i>themselves at the times that I specified.</i>

69
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:13,335
<i>I've proved many times that</i>
<i>I should be able</i>

70
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:15,238
<i>to control her within</i>
<i>these circumstances.</i>

71
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:17,610
<i>So why?</i>

72
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:24,579
<i>Ryuk.</i>

73
00:05:25,587 --> 00:05:26,417
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

74
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:29,012
<i>he was laughing oddly when</i>
<i>I was writing in the Death Note.</i>

75
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:30,687
<i>That's not all.</i>

76
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:34,217
<i>The way he laughed when I asked</i>
<i>for her name was also bizarre.</i>

77
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:37,461
<i>It occurred when it had</i>
<i>to do with her name</i>

78
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:39,733
<i>An alias!</i>

79
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:51,645
Thank you all for working so hard.

80
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,671
T This person is Watari?

81
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,880
Um, where are your usual clothes?

82
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:59,516
If I had dressed as I usually do,

83
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:01,179
it would be like telling everyone
I'm Watari.

84
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:04,787
It would also give away Ryuzaki's
location in this hotel.

85
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,759
I I see.

86
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:13,392
Showing my face in front of you
all means you've won Ryuzaki's trust.

87
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,967
I I feel kind of honored...

88
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:22,274
Ryuzaki, I've brought what
you've requested.

89
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,605
Please pass them out to everyone.

90
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:25,571
Yes.

91
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:31,449
These are everyone's new police IDs.

92
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:33,044
New?

93
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:36,687
<i>An alias.</i>

94
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,224
<i>That's the only thing it could be!</i>

95
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:41,889
<i>Ryuk can see her real name.</i>

96
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:44,121
<i>That's why he was laughing.</i>

97
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:47,901
<i>This woman was being careful</i>
<i>from the start.</i>

98
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:49,464
<i>That's right.</i>

99
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:53,830
<i>She believes that Raye died.</i>
<i>because he showed his ID.</i>

100
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:57,811
<i>That's why she's acting without</i>
<i>revealing her identity.</i>

101
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,511
<i>This isn't good.</i>

102
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:02,249
<i>It's even harder to ask the real name</i>

103
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:04,546
<i>of someone who has already</i>
<i>given an alias.</i>

104
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:07,678
<i>If I keep asking her persistently,</i>
<i>she'll get suspicious.</i>

105
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:11,780
<i>More importantly, it's suspicious</i>
<i>that I knew she was using an alias.</i>

106
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:15,556
I should be getting back soon.

107
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:19,325
Someone might have come back.

108
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:22,265
Oh, yeah.
I suppose you're right.

109
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:24,499
Hopefully someone did.

110
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:25,795
Yes.

111
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,508
<i>Damn..</i> <i>!

112
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:32,976
<i>It would also be unnatural</i>
<i>to try to turn her back.</i>

113
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,843
<i>What should I do? At this rate.</i>

114
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:41,916
<i>Oh no.</i>

115
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:44,286
<i>If my father calls.</i>

116
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:46,890
<i>I promised her that I'd let her</i>
<i>talk to him!</i>

117
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,256
<i>It's all over if he calls!</i>

118
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:50,627
<i>What do I do?</i>

119
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:57,195
<i>W What am I thinking about?</i>
<i>I can just turn off my cell phone.</i>

120
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,407
<i>Calm down.</i>

121
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,500
<i>I just have to find out her name.</i>

122
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:07,713
<i>Her purse, her pocket,</i>
<i>she's got to have a driver's license</i>

123
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:10,046
<i>or some sort of personal ID</i>
<i>on her somewhere.</i>

124
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:11,681
<i>She's a woman.</i>

125
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:13,613
<i>If things become desperate,</i>
<i>I can use force.</i>

126
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:15,484
<i>That's stupid!</i>

127
00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:18,118
<i>I can't do anything that'll</i>
<i>cause a stir in a place like this.</i>

128
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:20,391
<i>I've got to get her to</i>
<i>somewhere isolated.</i>

129
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:23,491
<i>Where? What explanation</i>
<i>can I offer her?</i>

130
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:26,489
<i>She's too careful.</i>

131
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:29,099
<i>No, I've got to change</i>
<i>my plan of attack.</i>

132
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:30,429
<i>I can do this.</i>

133
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:32,798
<i>I can get her name without</i>
<i>setting any alarms off.</i>

134
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,474
Light.

135
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:39,545
We can always do the eye deal.

136
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:42,148
It's no different from putting
on contact lenses.

137
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:43,777
I'll be finished in a few seconds.

138
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:48,619
<i>I won't have my remaining life</i>
<i>halved by the likes of this woman.</i>

139
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:52,588
<i>No, I won't ever consider the deal!</i>

140
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:54,058
<i>Don't bother me.</i>

141
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:55,722
<i>Shut up, Shinigami!</i>

142
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:58,396
Excuse me.

143
00:08:58,633 --> 00:08:59,361
Yes?

144
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,299
Do you still have business
at the police department?

145
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:04,968
I'll be all right by myself.

146
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:08,104
I understand.

147
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,501
Our names and ranks are all fake.

148
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:13,977
Fake police IDs?!

149
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,607
Kira requires a name
and a face to kill.

150
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,344
We are challenging Kira
with that premise in mind.

151
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:23,154
This is only natural.

152
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:26,716
B-But a police officer with a fake ID is...

153
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:30,264
No, if Kira needs a name to kill,

154
00:09:30,798 --> 00:09:34,564
an alias would go a long way
in protecting our lives.

155
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,603
We should carry these around.

156
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:38,594
I think so, too.

157
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:39,534
Yeah.

158
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:43,468
When you have to give out your
name to strangers,

159
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:46,313
use the alias in your IDs.

160
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:47,543
Yes.

161
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:51,542
Please be careful not to take
them out

162
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:52,984
within the police headquarters.

163
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:55,284
It could cause problems.

164
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:57,217
Understood.

165
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:02,619
Well then...
I want everyone to wear these belts.

166
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:03,795
Belts?

167
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:07,466
There is a tracking device
in the buckle.

168
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:10,802
This way, Ryuzaki will know
your whereabouts.

169
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:13,196
And when you press the buckle twice...

170
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:17,274
My cell phone will ring.

171
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:21,811
And I'll call you back immediately.

172
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:25,752
In the morning, you will go to work
at the police department.

173
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,684
Later, using this method...

174
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:31,414
I shall confirm our
hotel and room number.

175
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:34,220
Please use this
for emergencies as well.

176
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:36,187
This is kind of cool.

177
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:38,732
It's like we're a special force
chasing Kira!

178
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:39,828
Matsuda!

179
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,668
This isn't child's play.

180
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:43,398
Don't joke around.

181
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:44,863
Okay...

182
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,534
Thank you very much.

183
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,610
Thanks to you, I have gained
confidence in my theory.

184
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:52,975
Not at all...

185
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:02,479
<i>Since Ryuk started talking</i>
<i>about the eye bargain.</i>

186
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:05,423
<i>There's no mistake.</i>
<i>She's using an alias.</i>

187
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:10,894
<i>At this rate, with her theory that</i>
<i>Kira was on the bus.</i>

188
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:13,660
<i>and given the people Raye Penber</i>
<i>was in charge of investigating,</i>

189
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,935
<i>the police will immediately suspect me.</i>

190
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:20,938
Hey, she's leaving.
Is that okay?

191
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,177
<i>It should be about five minutes until</i>
<i>she reaches the police headquarters.</i>

192
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:26,805
<i>Think.</i>

193
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:30,216
<i>How can I get her name</i>
<i>within five minutes?</i>

194
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:46,600
<i>She's going to the police headquarters.</i>

195
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:50,769
<i>If someone from the task force</i>
<i>has returned, I'm finished.</i>

196
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:54,973
<i>Somehow, I've got to find out</i>
<i>her real name and finish her off.</i>

197
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:58,371
<i>Now there are only three minutes</i>
<i>until she reaches the police headquarters.</i>

198
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:00,612
<i>All right.</i>

199
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:03,711
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

200
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:04,847
Excuse me.

201
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:05,881
Yes?

202
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:09,254
There's something I haven't told you.

203
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:10,622
Okay...

204
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:15,619
It's impossible to contact anyone
directly in headquarters.

205
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:16,720
Huh?

206
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,260
<i>I have to conduct this conversation</i>
<i>naturally and</i>

207
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,234
<i>connect it to something</i>
<i>that she'll latch onto.</i>

208
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,761
<i>Within that time, I'll draw out her name.</i>

209
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,663
<i>I can do this.</i>

210
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,899
What do you mean?

211
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,040
Don't you think that it's odd
that there's no one at headquarters?

212
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,608
Y Yes.

213
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,678
I thought it was strange, but...

214
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:41,917
The team investigating Kira is structured
so no one knows who is involved.

215
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:48,256
If the public knows how
the team is structured,

216
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:52,259
a tragedy like the one involving
your fiancé may happen again...

217
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:58,861
I understand.

218
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:03,000
That's why you were told
that no one was at the headquarters.

219
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:05,638
In other words,

220
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,110
you will never be allowed to talk
directly to someone from headquarters.

221
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:16,022
That's pretty clever.
As expected of you, Light.

222
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:19,716
Why do you know so much?

223
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:23,026
She's pretty sharp.

224
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:27,230
I guess I have no choice.

225
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:28,791
I shall tell you...

226
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,270
It's because I'm a detective
from the task force.

227
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,836
You're a detective from the task force?

228
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:37,071
Yes.

229
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:40,447
L is currently in charge of the task force.

230
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:41,575
Yes.

231
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,276
I thought so.

232
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:47,549
L was troubled because there
weren't enough detectives at headquarters.

233
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:50,752
Many quit because they're afraid of Kira.

234
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,550
I'm just a high school student, but...

235
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:58,331
I have helped the police
solve two cases in the past.

236
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,124
So he was sold by that?

237
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:04,037
I can enter the headquarters
whenever I wish,

238
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:07,033
and I'm allowed to investigate
on my own.

239
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:11,404
In other words, the people who
are currently at headquarters...

240
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:14,778
are the chosen few who...

241
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:18,478
can be trusted and whose
abilities are reliable.

242
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:31,998
I understand.

243
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:36,028
But just in case,
I think I'll visit the headquarters.

244
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,862
Thank you very much.

245
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:42,265
P-Please wait!

246
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:46,175
I just told you that
you can't talk to anyone.

247
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,380
I would like to talk directly to L.

248
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:57,618
Come to think of it,
who's at headquarters now?

249
00:14:58,025 --> 00:14:59,686
No one is there now.

250
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:01,251
That's not good.

251
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:04,627
Have at least one person
there at all times.

252
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:05,932
Understood.

253
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,126
Aizawa, if you could stay there for today...

254
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,065
Okay.

255
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,097
I can get there quickly from here.

256
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:13,639
Ms. Maki, please wait.

257
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:15,666
It's impossible to meet L.

258
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,234
It's useless.

259
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:25,212
He might... allow me to meet him.

260
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:29,381
I only followed his orders from
beyond a computer screen, but...

261
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:35,520
Two years ago in America
I worked on a case under L.

262
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:38,258
You worked under L?

263
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:43,960
Until three months ago,
I was an FBI agent.

264
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:48,333
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>I can use this.</i>

265
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:50,773
Is that so?

266
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,806
It's no wonder. Your actions are
not those of an amateur.

267
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,683
You move carefully and wisely
as you get to the heart of the matter.

268
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:01,921
I'd like to learn from you.

269
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:06,325
It's amazing how you can
line up all those lies like that.

270
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:09,628
I must approach this case
in my own way.

271
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:14,157
I have to suspect the police
and even the people within task force.

272
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:17,060
But I trust L.

273
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:20,868
I thought that if I went to headquarters

274
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:26,811
and have them verify my name and face...
I'd be able to speak directly to L.

275
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:28,242
I see...

276
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,710
But why did you tell me that
you wanted to talk to L?

277
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,014
When I wasn't allowed to see
someone from the task force,

278
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:39,024
I was angry and then
I ran into someone

279
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:41,357
who claimed to be
the son of the lead detective...

280
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,992
No, that's not it.

281
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,066
I'll tell you the truth.

282
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,692
You seemed like L.

283
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,367
I felt that you two are similar.

284
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:04,473
Shall we investigate the
case together?

285
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:05,442
Huh?

286
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:09,516
Will you work as
an agent in the task force?

287
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,153
Of course, not just anybody is allowed.

288
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:16,792
But we need people like you!

289
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:20,822
You could be doing more than
gathering general information.

290
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:23,666
You were an FBI agent.

291
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:26,833
You're more talented than
our current detectives.

292
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:29,432
Even L trusted you.

293
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:33,740
To join the task force,
you need proper identification,

294
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:36,514
a recommendation from
a current detective on the team,

295
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,811
and finally L's permission.

296
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:41,083
You want me to join
the task force?

297
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:44,722
It must be fate to meet you here!

298
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:47,387
I'll recommend you!

299
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,089
Oh, sorry.

300
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,131
I just became a little excited...

301
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:56,661
N No, it's okay...

302
00:17:57,137 --> 00:18:00,732
Even if you can cooperate
with the investigation,

303
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:03,170
I understand you have personal
circumstances to attend to.

304
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:05,604
Especially since you live in America...

305
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:09,510
I was planning to continue living
with my fiancé in America,

306
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,676
he and I were to be
married this spring.

307
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,920
But now that he's dead...

308
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:17,456
I have no idea what I'll do now...

309
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:18,454
<i>All right.</i>

310
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,219
<i>Since I've come this far,</i>
<i>I'll push a little.</i>

311
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:24,462
But you're still very young and beautiful.

312
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:26,692
You shouldn't be involved
in such a dangerous investigation...

313
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:27,492
No!

314
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:29,965
I don't have anything to lose.

315
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:31,399
I want to catch Kira!

316
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:33,900
It's all I want to do!

317
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:36,072
Please let me investigate with you!

318
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:46,450
Thank goodness.

319
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:50,380
Well, may I see something that may act
as some form of personal ID?

320
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,421
Well...

321
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:53,618
Yes?

322
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:58,422
Actually, that name I gave you earlier
was not my real name...

323
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,064
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,126
Huh?

325
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:03,563
That's all right.

326
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:07,268
Amazing! Who would have thought
you were being so careful?

327
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,399
You're one step ahead of me.

328
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:12,644
That's even further proof
that you're qualified.

329
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:15,141
Is a Japanese driver's license okay?

330
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:16,276
Yes.

331
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:36,895
<i>I made it.</i>

332
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,420
Excuse me, but why do you always
pay such close attention to your watch?

333
00:19:58,091 --> 00:19:59,718
Oh... this?

334
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:02,429
It's because...

335
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,022
I'm Kira.

336
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:38,963
What's wrong?

337
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,330
I have something I have to do.

338
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,029
Oh.

339
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,737
My father's cell phone is on now.

340
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:51,209
Don't you want to talk to him?

341
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:54,777
I have nothing I want to talk about.

342
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,446
Good bye, Miss Naomi Misora.

343
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:28,203
<i>I dreamed a dream that no one could see,</i>

344
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:33,584
<i>I threw away everything that I didn't need</i>

345
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:42,592
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>
<i>that I can't give up in my heart</i>

346
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:48,998
<i>Even if my feet fall victim</i>
<i>to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

347
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:53,563
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

348
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:59,277
<i>I can't hold back the flooding impulses</i>

349
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:06,718
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>
<i>to accomplish</i>

350
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:11,917
<i>[deceit] [fear] [vanity] [melancholy]</i>

351
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:22,663
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>
<i>any of these negative perceptions</i>

352
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:28,472
<i>I'm a trickster who doesn't know solitude</i>

353
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:42,084
With Ryuk's information
and my prior preparations,

354
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:45,450
I can kill criminals
currently being broadcast...

355
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:50,461
while masquerading as
a regular high school student.

356
00:22:50,897 --> 00:22:52,797
Just watch, L!
