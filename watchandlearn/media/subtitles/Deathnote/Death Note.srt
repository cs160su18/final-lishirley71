has been identified.

His name is Hiromichi Imaizumi,
age 45.

The police say
that he is deeply in debt...

71
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:56,718
which could be the motive for
this armed robbery.

We can hear the suspect shouting.

Five hours have passed since
the hold-up began, but still no sign of...

78
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:28,953
I see people coming out.

79
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,221
A riot squad is
entering the building.

80

The hostages are coming out.
They're all safe.

We've just received news
that the suspect is dead.

According to the employees
held hostage...

84
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:58,987
Imaizumi suddenly
clutched his chest and collapsed.

85
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:01,115
Another mysterious death.

86
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,352
Is that it?

87
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,327
I can't think of anything else.

88
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:09,696
It's Kira. He did it.

89
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,638
It's your fault.

90
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,066
You're impossible.

91
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,009
You thief.

92
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:38,516
Future Superintendent, betting?

93
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,817
I'll buy you lunch.

94
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,756
That money's not clean.

95
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,419
I worked hard for it.

96
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,622
I wanted to celebrate.

97
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:48,494
Celebrate what?

98
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,862
The notice board.

99
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:54,628
You've passed the Bar Exam.

100
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:04,280
I'm the one who wanted
to be a district attorney.

101
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:08,273
You don't have to rush it, Shiori.

102
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:11,515
I just want to catch up with you.

103
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,317
I support Kira.

104
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:14,914
He's our saviour.

105
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,224
But he just ignores civil rights
and false charges.

106
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,093
I can't approve of him.

107
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:25,364
Does studying law help?

108
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:26,699
Kira helps.

109
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,398
Let's do a research on Kira.

110
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,275
They're all talking about Kira.

111
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,774
He's the god of justice.

112
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:41,841
That sounds too arrogant.

113
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,648
Really?

114
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:46,588
All criminals should be
punished by the law.

115
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:51,287
I might do the same
if I had his special powers.

116
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:52,988
Never.

117
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,796
You have your own way of
changing the world with law.

118
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,701
The law has its limits.

119
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:03,069
There are limits to everything.

120
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:11,004
Last month, I hacked into the database
of the Police Agency.

121
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:16,481
I needed to find out...

122
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,979
whether the criminals were
receiving adequate punishment.

123
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:33,669
But what I saw was the limit
to the justice I believed in.

124
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,837
This can't be...

125
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,105
"Wanted"

126
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:42,270
"Case Dropped"

127
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,576
"Unsolved"

128
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:53,278
Many criminals were
never captured for some reason.

129
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:55,086
The secret data showed
they were free from punishment.

130
00:12:56,326 --> 00:13:00,353
"Takuo Shibuimaru"

We were kept in the dark about that
to avoid confusion.

133
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,834
Is that really... possible?

134
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,866
I couldn't believe it, either.

135
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,508
A MONTH AGO
That's why I needed to
see for myself.

136
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,797
You got away with murder.

137
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,733
Is that fair?

138
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:42,704
I get carried away sometimes.

139
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,764
And then...

140
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:47,800
I hear this voice.

141
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,571
What does it say?

142
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:56,082
"Kill him!"

143
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:02,621
Just kidding.

144
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:08,625
You've taken years off my life.

145
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,964
Did you hear it?

146
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:15,095
The cry of the parent whose kid I killed
when they heard the verdict.

147
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:18,403
"Bring back my child"

148
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,884
What're you looking at?

149
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,514
A relative of the kid?

150
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,390
This reminds me.

151
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:45,633
How it felt as the knife
slipped into the flesh...

152
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:49,869
and cut through his heart.

153
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:58,241
Why am I here?

154
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,841
I don't remember.

155
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,847
No one can put me behind bars.

156
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:23,062
Why did you go there?

157
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,437
It's dangerous.

158
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:29,002
Shiori, do you still
disapprove of Kira?

159
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:34,244
Do you honestly believe
they'll be punished by the law?

160
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:42,057
I will not tell her the rest.

161
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:46,357
No one will know my secret.

The trial of the high school girl
murder case was held today.

165
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:51,721
The alleged killer, Kaonuma
showed no sign of remorse...

00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,754
making the victim's family
even angrier.

00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:05,969
and dragged her into a public toilet
where he stabbed her to death.

169
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:10,639
"KAONUMA"

170
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:19,751
He sent a letter to the papers
admitting his deeds.

171
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,954
The police are searching thoroughly
for other charges.

172
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:41,033
Don't forget your handkerchief.

173
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,874
Then off you go.

174
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:49,484
You're up at last.
I envy college students.

175
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,646
Be careful of strangers.

176
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,450
I will. Bye.

177
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,091
Light, hurry and eat up your breakfast.

178
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:07,866
"A Sudden Death in Jail"

179
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:09,599
"Yosuke Kaonuma"

180
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:22,780
"YOSUKE KAONUMA"

181
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:34,218
Aren't you having breakfast?

182
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,137
Remember him?

183
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:23,234
"TAKUO SHIBUIMARU"

184
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,001
What is it?

185
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,637
Are you alright?

186
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:14,727
Wake up.

187
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,497
He's dead.

188
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,506
What's happening?

189
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:43,523
Glad you like it.

190
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:13,179
What's the matter?

191
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:16,621
Can't you believe your eyes?

192
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:30,834
So, the god of death pays me a visit.

193
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:36,536
I dropped the notebook.

194
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,813
Are you taking it away from me?

195
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:47,981
Finders keepers. It's all yours.

196
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:55,128
Do I have to give you my life
in return?

197
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:08,342
Don't worry. If you don't want it
pass it on to someone else.

198
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:13,679
In which case, I'll erase
your memory of the "Death Note".

199
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:17,383
Is that all?

200
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:26,353
You may experience agony and fear
that only the user will come to know.

201
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:30,695
Well, that might not concern you.

202
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:45,841
Can other people... see you, too?

203
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:52,445
Only the people
who touch the "Death Note".

204
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:54,080
Tell me your name.

205
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,489
Curious?

206
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:03,622
Call me "Ryuk".

207
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,535
FOUR MONTHS LATER
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

208
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,575
It's impossible.
We can't make this case.

209
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:31,190
The victims are criminals and
are scattered all over the world.

210
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:34,196
We see no connection whatsoever.

211
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,458
Chief.

212
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:40,458
This may be caused by
some unknown virus after all.

213
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:44,303
Want to throw it over to
the Ministry of Health?

214
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:51,136
I'm convinced
that this is a massacre.

215
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:56,675
I will not tolerate it;
the way he carries out his crimes.

216
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:00,585
We must get the madman.

217
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:05,220
We're with you all the way, Chief.

218
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:09,362
I have to see the Commissioner.

219
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:20,097
THE NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

220
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:26,675
I'm here, Sir.

221
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:32,219
Matsubara, when did you come back?

222
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:33,551
Yesterday.

223
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:39,152
The ICPO have concluded
that the culprit is in Japan.

224
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:41,493
How did they conclude that?

225
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,398
The first death occurred in Japan.

226
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:49,393
So the culprit must be here.
That's what "L" says.

227
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,532
So it's him.

228
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:59,810
He's cracked many unsolved cases
all over the world.

229
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:04,313
He's our last chance.

230
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:18,324
We can contact L
only through Watari.

231
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:23,464
I've been asked to present
this message from L.

232
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:38,142
Hello everyone. I am L.

233
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:44,893
The unexplainable deaths that
have occurred around the world...

234
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:52,163
is most likely caused by a single genius;
a slaughter by a vicious human being.

235
00:25:56,939 --> 00:26:03,310
This data shows the deaths in Asia
caused by the Micrwa virus...

236
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:10,183
along with the distinctions of sex
age and nationality of the deceased.

237
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,852
A distribution chart.

238
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:19,885
A natural occurrence would show
a gentle slope like this.

239
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:28,897
Now, this is the chart of
the unexplainable deaths.

240
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:31,899
I see.

241
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:36,571
Are you suggesting that
the deaths are unnatural?

242
00:26:36,612 --> 00:26:38,102
Yes.

243
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:41,116
I will call the culprit,
"Kira" for now.

244
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,679
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that he did it alone.

245
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:54,651
This shows the number of people
and the success rates of the crime.

246
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:59,530
Group crimes are much less
successful.

247
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:07,133
If we assume
that this is a group crime...

248
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:14,207
he would have to have at least
80 accomplices around the world.

249
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:21,554
With 80 accomplices,
the success rate would drop enormously.

250
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:27,460
This indicates that it is being done
by an individual.

251
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:33,435
Then how do you explain
all the killings at the same time?

252
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:35,699
Your theory won't work.

253
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:43,577
I could narrow the profile down and
prove to you, how he executes his plan.

254
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,670
How?

255
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,109
This is all for now.
Until then, good-bye.

256
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,628
You don't agree with him?

257
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:07,568
It's not a matter of agreeing,
we have no other choice.

258
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:17,535
I will make Yagami the leader of
the Investigation Team.

259
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,054
"Kira"

260
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,687
Look Ryuk.

261
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:37,790
They're all talking about him
on the net.

262
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:43,198
The world can feel
that justice indeed exists.

263
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,172
"Kira", that's me.

264
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,112
Feeling good?

265
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:58,950
They all know that the bad guys
are being eliminated.

266
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:06,359
The good will rejoice
and the bad will tremble in fear.

267
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:09,023
History is about to change.

268
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:14,399
"Death Note" will help make
a crime-free world.

269
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:18,133
The future is in my hands.

270
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,040
What a hero.

271
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:32,781
They've sent me news about Kira.

272
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:37,016
"A news flash"

273
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:51,939
We bring you live report...

274
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:53,839
Who's he?

275
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:59,405
From the International
Criminal Police Organization.

276
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:07,683
"My name is Lind L. Tailor,
known as L."

277
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:14,788
"I have been asked by the ICPO
to help find the serial killer."

278
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:20,700
"This is one of the most
brutal crimes in history."

279
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:27,471
"The mastermind behind this,
known as Kira..."

280
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:32,742
"has an extraordinary ego,
and is a vile and immature criminal."

281
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:36,547
"Immature" is right.

282
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:45,186
"I, L will assure you that
Kira will be arrested at all cost."

283
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:46,319
Be my guest.

284
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:50,991
"Kira, I can easily read
your moves..."

285
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,593
"because of your immaturity."

286
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:57,162
"You are not allowed
to exist in this world."

287
00:30:57,206 --> 00:31:03,304
"You are far lower than
the criminals you've eliminated."

288
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:05,745
You are, too.

289
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:10,246
I'll let the world know.

290
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:16,390
"However, there are many
who support Kira."

291
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:20,828
"He has taken the law
into his hands."

292
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:26,497
It's a pity I can't play games
with you anymore.

293
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:33,705
"But if we allow people
to be judged this way..."

294
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:40,113
"our civilization will revert to
a world of brutality."

295
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:45,753
40 seconds...

296
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,501
Call an ambulance.

297
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:25,784
Impressive.

298
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:29,695
So, Kira...

299
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:31,824
you can kill people
without lifting a finger.

300
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:37,405
Hear this, Kira.

301
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:43,241
The man you've just killed
is a convict on death row.

302
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,716
It was hidden from the media, and
his arrest was strictly confidential.

303
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:54,785
We made him appear as me.

304
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:59,523
The real L is still alive.

305
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:05,197
Kill me if you dare.

306
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:14,772
You can't, can you?

307
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:18,342
And Kira...

308
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,781
I have new piece of information.

309
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:27,955
You are now around Tokyo area.

310
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:34,086
We've made you think it was worldwide

311
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:37,326
but the broadcast was restricted.

312
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,703
The first crime occurred in Japan,
so we knew you were here somewhere.

313
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:50,702
But now, we're sure.

314
00:33:50,746 --> 00:33:52,213
Awesome.

315
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,340
This isn't a game.

316
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,907
Watch your mouth.

317
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:57,643
Sorry.

318
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:05,924
The police are right behind you.

319
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:10,421
Kira.

320
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,229
We will solve every mystery
and hunt you down without fail.

321
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:17,136
Your penalty is death.

322
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:23,007
My penalty?

323
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,308
I am justice.

324
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:33,778
No, I am justice.

325
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:38,385
Saviour of the weak
and god of the new world.

326
00:34:38,427 --> 00:34:42,761
The ones who disobey are evil.

327
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:48,762
You kill in the name of justice.
Humans are fun.

328
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:55,935
I've got to see who wins.

329
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:57,776
Right.

330
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:02,247
Chief, I've confirmed.

331
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:08,184
The fake L on TV has actually died.

332
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:14,127
L actually narrowed the culprit down.

333
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:18,428
They've sacrificed the life of a convict.

334
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:22,861
That makes them no different
from Kira.

335
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,475
"L vs Kira"

336
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:33,414
"Convict Killed On Air"

337
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,642
"Kira, the Killer"

338
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:41,281
"A Full Investigation"

339
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:43,655
"Detective L vs Kira"

340
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:47,319
"Heart Attack, Lind L. Tailor"

341
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:50,263
"Kira Kills Convict"

342
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:53,096
At first I thought it was
"Candid Camera".

343
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:56,332
What do you think of Kira?

344
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,202
He should leave it to the police.

345
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,105
And the court.

346
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:02,135
What?

347
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:03,804
Did you see the news?

348
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,204
Come in.

349
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:19,455
They let a person die on TV.

350
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:23,863
I thought it was a rotten trick
using a convict.

351
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:28,964
I knew you'd be on Kira's side.

352
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:32,798
He's far better than L.

353
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,605
Kira is a murderer.
What he's doing isn't justice.

354
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:40,376
But the crime rate is dropping.

355
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,906
He's just holding us down with fear.

356
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,751
Think of it as a revolution.

357
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,019
Revolutions have betrayed us.

358
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:55,052
What a fighter.

359
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,358
Shut up.

360
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:01,327
Nothing. Let's go outside.

361
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,391
Want to try it?

362
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:38,300
Why not.

363
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:48,311
I can't... with people around.

364
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:53,315
Not unless it were our last kiss.

365
00:37:56,591 --> 00:38:01,221
What if she were to discover
that you are Kira?

366
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:07,167
I believe Shiori would understand
someday.

367
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,800
L, here's a report from
the Investigation Team.

368
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:18,312
Please begin.

369
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:25,847
This chart as requested by L,
shows the victims' times of deaths.

370
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:30,648
I see nothing special here.

371
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:34,321
Have you heard of?
The Law of Large Numbers?

372
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:36,330
Large Numbers?

373
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:42,962
It's a theorem Bernoulli created
in observing nature.

374
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:47,939
Is L watching this?

375
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:50,706
It's connected to L's computer.

376
00:38:55,183 --> 00:39:00,018
We split this seemingly random data
into seven sections.

377
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:02,455
Is L doing that?

378
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,219
I suppose.

379
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,296
What is that?

380
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:17,362
It looks familiar.

381
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:20,941
A timetable.

382
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:23,239
A college students' schedule.

383
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:28,477
Mondays start from third period.

384
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:30,484
Tuesdays have early starts.

385
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:40,656
College student Kira,
who doesn't kill during class.

386
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:48,525
You're in a good mood.

387
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,834
Am I?

388
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:54,137
You've promised to tell me
how things are going with Shiori.

389
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:55,938
No, I haven't.

390
00:39:57,746 --> 00:40:00,681
I'm curious, too.
What's going on with you and her?

391
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:04,251
Father's home.

392
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,719
Don't run away.

393
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:08,551
You're back.

394
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,579
Welcome home.

395
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,091
Light and Shiori are...

396
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:12,991
Blabbermouth.

397
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:15,621
What about him?

398
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:20,633
Here you are.

399
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,694
It's nice drinking at home.

400
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:28,332
I knew you were exhausted.

401
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:31,208
Why?

402
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:33,874
You're in charge of Kira's case.

403
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,350
Why would I be?

404
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:40,218
Seems like there's a lot on your mind.

405
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:45,089
Father, I want to help you.

406
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:47,321
Light.

407
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:51,662
I know you've helped us
several times before.

408
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:56,999
You have a sharp mind.

409
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,905
And I'm very proud of you.

410
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:02,774
I'm proud, too.

411
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:04,506
That's right.

412
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:12,043
But this time, we're dealing with
a dangerous killer.

413
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:19,283
He's a devil that kills
without doing anything himself.

414
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,127
I can't have you involved.

415
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,029
But I could...

416
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,695
No.

417
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,775
This is my case.

418
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:40,244
Your time will come
5 or 10 years from now.

419
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:45,116
Save your strength for then.

420
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:48,448
Don't rush it.

421
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:51,824
I understand.

422
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,326
I'll go study.

423
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:57,658
For 10 years from now.

424
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:02,195
Father.

425
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:06,137
But if something were to
happen to you...

426
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:11,339
I'd send Kira to the gallows.

427
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:32,589
Can you believe that your father
was in charge of the case?

428
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,202
Police's database?

429
00:42:42,243 --> 00:42:46,407
This is today's report on
the investigation.

430
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:50,842
They know Kira is a student.

431
00:42:59,193 --> 00:43:03,061
24 criminals are dying per day.

432
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:06,294
Precisely one per hour.

433
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,268
What does this mean?

434
00:43:08,303 --> 00:43:11,238
Kira isn't a student after all

435
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:15,431
That's not what he's telling us.

436
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:17,501
Then what?

437
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:20,912
He can manipulate the times of death.

438
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:25,249
Manipulate the times of death?

439
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:27,686
And one more thing.

440
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:32,352
Our information has been
leaking out to Kira.

441
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:39,529
It was three days ago
that we discovered he was a student.

442
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:43,025
From the next day,
the time became irregular.

443
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:44,766
Which means...

444
00:43:44,806 --> 00:43:51,678
Kira is telling the police
that he is amongst us.

445
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:02,754
Don't you think it's a quiet afternoon
for a revolution?

446
00:44:04,092 --> 00:44:10,031
The crime rate is dropping
thanks to Kira.

447
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,267
We're getting closer to
a crime-free world.

448
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:20,673
Who could have imagined
such a future was possible?

449
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,842
What's the matter, Ryuk?
Tired of apples?

450
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,688
There's no one...

451
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:57,277
I'm being followed. Since when?

452
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:59,040
The day before yesterday.

453
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,945
Why didn't you tell me?

454
00:45:00,982 --> 00:45:05,180
I'm not on your side nor L's.

455
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:09,353
Police, right?

456
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,918
No, they can't be onto me yet.

457
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,054
Who can he be?

458
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:38,179
Light.

459
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:41,245
We, gods of death survive on
the years of human lives.

460
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:42,847
What do you mean?

461
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:48,385
People who die because of the book,
leave behind the years...

462
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:53,526
You take away the years
they were supposed to live, right?

463
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:59,498
How do you think
we've come to know your names?

464
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:04,877
You can see them.

465
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:11,544
Your names and the years you'll live.

466
00:46:13,454 --> 00:46:15,354
You can see the years I have left

467
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:17,755
and his name, too?

468
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,689
Don't you want to see like me?

469
00:46:26,334 --> 00:46:28,461
I might.

470
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,434
What do I give you in return?

471
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:36,136
Half the years of your life.

472
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:38,210
Impossible.

473
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:42,774
Then how will you get his name?

474
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,627
Chief, three others died in jail.

475
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,696
Shirami cut his fingers

476
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,674
and drew a large star on the wall.

477
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:13,043
Yadanaka left a suicide note.

478
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,915
And Tobe escaped from his cell
and ran into the lavatory...

479
00:47:17,952 --> 00:47:20,750
where he died of heart attack.

480
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:28,391
Mr. Yagami.

481
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,796
Tell the press that it was
nothing more than a heart attack.

482
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:34,394
Why?

483
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:39,463
It seems like Kira is trying to
test something with these deaths.

484
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:56,722
See?

485
00:47:56,757 --> 00:48:00,318
It's all here; the information
they didn't give in their statement.

486
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:06,658
The killings were carried out
just as I'd written.

487
00:48:07,235 --> 00:48:09,032
What a surprise!

488
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:14,839
Today in Kanagawa?
at 2:40 in the afternoon...

489
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:19,711
here was a robbery at Teikai Bank
which left three employees dead.

490
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:23,239
Three men disappeared with
5 million yen.

491
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:28,813
Later, two of them were captured,
but one is still on the run.

492
00:48:30,224 --> 00:48:34,183
He is Kiichiro Osoreda, age 36.

493
00:48:34,228 --> 00:48:36,628
His past convictions were...

494
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,154
Ryuk.

495
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:44,902
People who touch the Death Note
can see you, is that right?

496
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:46,566
So what?

497
00:49:31,419 --> 00:49:33,683
The bus is starting.

498
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:54,030
The bus is a nice change.

499
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:59,568
There's someone following me
for the past three days.

500
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:07,452
Why are you following me?

501
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:11,689
Are you someone from
the inquiry agency?

502
00:50:12,326 --> 00:50:14,021
I don't know
what you're talking about.

503
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:22,669
What is this?

504
00:50:51,532 --> 00:50:54,865
If you want to live, do as I say.

505
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:58,498
Shut up. Be quiet.

506
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,271
Light...

507
00:51:09,617 --> 00:51:11,517
Call the company.

508
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:18,691
This is Sasaki on bus 124.

509
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:21,526
This bus is mine.

510
00:51:21,562 --> 00:51:24,963
If you want the hostages alive,
get me 100 million.

511
00:51:30,905 --> 00:51:34,966
"I'll find a chance and grab him."

512
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,812
Don't. It's too risky.

513
00:51:43,384 --> 00:51:45,682
You must leave it to me.

514
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,917
How could I trust you?
I'm the son of a police officer.

515
00:51:55,129 --> 00:51:56,619
Let me go.

516
00:51:56,664 --> 00:51:58,393
Wait.

517
00:51:58,432 --> 00:52:01,162
I can save you from him.

518
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:06,105
How will I know
that you're not an accomplice?

519
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:08,104
Accomplice?

520
00:52:08,142 --> 00:52:13,239
In most cases, they team up
and one of them works as a lookout.

521
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,582
Alright

522
00:52:25,826 --> 00:52:27,521
The FBI?

523
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,725
His name... Raye Iwamatsu.

524
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,967
What're you up to?

525
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:54,281
Kid, you have some nerve.

526
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:00,750
What in the hell are you?

527
00:53:00,794 --> 00:53:05,128
Can you see me?

528
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:08,135
Where did you come from?

529
00:53:11,205 --> 00:53:15,266
I see. A piece of the Death Note.

530
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:15,832
You monster.

531
00:53:15,876 --> 00:53:17,207
Get down.

532
00:53:25,085 --> 00:53:26,848
Too bad.

533
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:30,948
I'm the god of death
so I don't die easily.

534
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:41,801
Stop!

535
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:43,496
Stop the bus.

536
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:09,490
Kiichiro Osoreda, car accident.

537
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,897
On March 29th, 2006...

538
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:20,700
he gets on the 10:12 Kyonan bus
bound for the Okukawa Garage.

539
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:28,580
He carries a gun with 8 bullets,
and tries to rob the bus...

540
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:36,780
but sees a horrifying phantom
and starts to fire at it.

541
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:41,887
With no bullets left,
he hurries off the bus and...

542
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:44,989
You.

543
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,796
If you have questions,
come to me directly.

544
00:54:47,835 --> 00:54:50,429
I won't run or hide.

545
00:54:50,471 --> 00:54:51,563
Let's go.

546
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:28,068
Your mother's coming.

547
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:30,804
And the hi-jacker?

548
00:55:30,844 --> 00:55:32,573
Died instantly.

549
00:55:32,613 --> 00:55:37,448
Serves him right.
The police are all over the place.

550
00:55:38,786 --> 00:55:40,515
We should...

551
00:55:41,188 --> 00:55:42,519
It's alright.

552
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:45,650
I've already told the police
about what we saw.

553
00:55:45,693 --> 00:55:51,928
So lie down and rest.

554
00:55:52,733 --> 00:55:55,827
Promise me you'll never
do it again.

555
00:55:58,906 --> 00:56:03,206
If something were to happen to you,
I don't know what I'd do.

556
00:56:05,546 --> 00:56:07,070
Shiori...

557
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,667
You're back.

558
00:56:43,384 --> 00:56:45,284
Is something the matter?

559
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,911
It's nothing.

560
00:56:56,029 --> 00:57:02,730
"He which made them at the beginning
made them male and female."

561
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:09,403
"A man shall leave father and mother,
and cleave to his wife."

562
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:15,713
"And they twain shall be one flesh."

563
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,547
The Bible.

564
00:57:21,388 --> 00:57:25,484
When are we going to church
to meet with the priest?

565
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,619
Is Saturday alright?

566
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:29,288
Fine.

567
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:35,429
Raye, you must be very careful.
You're dealing with Kira.

568
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:42,064
Who used to go on
dangerous missions for L?

569
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:44,839
You've changed me.

570
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:50,508
The new victim left a note.

571
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,094
"L, DID YOU KNOW?"

572
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:13,672
"THE GOD OF DEATH, EATS..."

573
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:15,675
"NOTHING BUT APPLES"!

574
00:58:17,945 --> 00:58:19,276
Sorry.

575
00:58:24,785 --> 00:58:28,915
There can't be only one FBI agent.

576
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:33,120
Suspecting that Kira was someone
within the authority...

577
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,097
L must have had the FBI
secretly follow me.

578
00:58:38,131 --> 00:58:43,569
That would mean he's not
the only agent in Japan.

579
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:49,440
If I kill him, I'll be suspected.

580
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:57,014
But what if all the FBI agents
on this case were to die?

581
00:58:58,111 --> 00:59:00,944
Hey, Light.

582
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,881
The FBI aren't criminals.

583
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,554
Killing them anyway?

584
00:59:13,226 --> 00:59:16,093
"Minami-Aoyama Catholic Church"

585
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:23,694
Raye.

586
00:59:23,736 --> 00:59:26,296
I'm sorry, Naomi.

587
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:29,467
I just got a call.
I'll join you later.

588
00:59:29,509 --> 00:59:32,171
But Father made time for us.

589
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:33,610
Patch things up for me.

590
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:16,108
"Raye Iwamatsu. I am Kira.
Use the transceiver inside."

591
01:01:16,149 --> 01:01:19,949
"I will talk to you directly."

592
01:01:37,036 --> 01:01:39,766
Hello, I am Kira.

593
01:01:40,773 --> 01:01:43,298
I am watching your every move.

594
01:01:44,077 --> 01:01:46,807
Do not look around. Face forward.

595
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:51,850
Remember, I can always kill you.

596
01:01:56,055 --> 01:01:58,888
How will I know you're not a fake?

597
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:02,355
I'll show you.
See the man sitting next to you

598
01:02:02,395 --> 01:02:07,526
His name is Taruhito Ozaki,
arrested for rape two years ago.

599
01:02:07,567 --> 01:02:16,202
But the victims feared revenge,
and did not press charges against him.

600
01:02:16,242 --> 01:02:21,771
He deserves to be punished.

601
01:02:22,682 --> 01:02:26,448
Taruhito Ozaki heart attack

602
01:02:26,486 --> 01:02:29,284
Taruhito Ozaki sits on
the right hand side of the train.

603
01:02:29,322 --> 01:02:32,086
After it leaves Akasakabashi Station,

604
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:37,085
he will die quietly from a heart attack.

605
01:02:39,532 --> 01:02:41,261
Stay calm.

606
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:48,804
Now quietly, see if he's dead and
make him look like he's sleeping.

607
01:03:11,931 --> 01:03:15,298
Do you believe I'm Kira now?
You killed him just to prove that?

608
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:19,829
Just answer my questions.

609
01:03:19,872 --> 01:03:27,938
Tell me how many people from the FBI
are here in Japan.

610
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:36,021
If you refuse, I'll start killing
the passengers one by one.

611
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:50,295
There are 11 people besides myself.

612
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:56,399
Do you know
all their names and faces?

613
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,468
No.

614
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,875
I'm telling you the truth.

615
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:12,256
But surely, you must know
who your leader is, don't you?

616
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,421
I do.

617
01:04:15,928 --> 01:04:19,489
You'll find five pieces of paper.

618
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:33,041
Write down the name of your leader
inside the blank of the first page.

619
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:35,240
Accurately.

620
01:04:35,281 --> 01:04:39,217
If you make it up,
I'll know immediately.

621
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:41,743
I wouldn't dare if I were you.

622
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:06,144
Cut on the computer.

623
01:05:06,178 --> 01:05:11,115
You'll soon get all 12 IDs of
the FBI from your leader.

624
01:05:11,584 --> 01:05:13,211
"Free Access Available"

625
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,512
I've got it.

626
01:05:47,887 --> 01:05:49,479
Open it.

627
01:05:57,396 --> 01:06:02,732
Look at the pictures of the agents
attached to their IDs...

628
01:06:02,768 --> 01:06:08,172
and fill in their names accurately
inside the rest of the blanks.

629
01:06:58,758 --> 01:07:00,123
Done.

630
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,159
Now, put them back in the envelope,
and place it on the rack.

631
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:37,490
Get off at Shinagawa Park Station.

632
01:07:38,164 --> 01:07:41,099
And leave the transceiver behind.

633
01:10:07,346 --> 01:10:10,713
Raye Iwamatsu, heart attack.

634
01:10:13,218 --> 01:10:19,418
Cancels all schedule, and
rides the train from Akasakabashi.

635
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:23,121
Gets on the 10:14 train

636
01:10:23,162 --> 01:10:25,790
from the last door of the fourth car.

637
01:10:26,665 --> 01:10:29,395
He takes the Manila envelope...

638
01:10:31,604 --> 01:10:35,199
and dies three seconds after
getting off.

639
01:10:43,549 --> 01:10:45,449
Five in Tokyo, three in Kanagawa,

640
01:10:45,484 --> 01:10:47,509
and four others.

641
01:10:47,553 --> 01:10:50,317
They all died of heart attacks.

642
01:10:50,356 --> 01:10:56,818
Their leader in Washington is said
to have died at the same hour.

643
01:10:57,229 --> 01:10:59,220
FBI agents?

644
01:10:59,264 --> 01:11:06,693
They were instructed by L
to secretly investigate the case.

645
01:11:06,739 --> 01:11:10,573
By L? Did you know about this?

646
01:11:10,609 --> 01:11:13,840
It's all out of the blue.

647
01:11:17,082 --> 01:11:19,846
"A Report on FBI Activities"

648
01:11:20,452 --> 01:11:25,446
The FBI agents that were
investigating the case died.

649
01:11:26,892 --> 01:11:29,622
All heart attacks.

650
01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:36,334
Kira is now killing people
besides criminals.

651
01:11:39,438 --> 01:11:44,307
It is possible that
we may all become targets.

652
01:11:45,077 --> 01:11:46,237
You should think carefully...

653
01:11:46,278 --> 01:11:53,377
about your families
and your loved ones.

654
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,452
You are free to drop out of
this investigation.

655
01:12:00,693 --> 01:12:05,926
I guarantee that you will not
be demoted or punished for doing so.

656
01:12:06,632 --> 01:12:12,867
Those of you who are not afraid to
risk everything can stay.

657
01:12:15,574 --> 01:12:22,343
Lastly, I thank those
who fought with us till this day.

658
01:13:12,397 --> 01:13:15,127
There's only six of us.

659
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:18,432
Watari and I are with you.

660
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:23,100
I have faith in people who have
a strong sense of justice.

661
01:13:23,142 --> 01:13:25,303
L.

662
01:13:25,344 --> 01:13:29,974
I'm sorry but
it's getting hard to trust you.

663
01:13:30,015 --> 01:13:35,851
You give us orders from a safe place,
keeping yourself hidden at all times.

664
01:13:35,888 --> 01:13:38,482
How can you expect us to trust you?

665
01:13:38,524 --> 01:13:41,493
We can't have you working with us.

666
01:13:41,527 --> 01:13:43,552
He's right.

667
01:13:43,595 --> 01:13:48,430
To tell the truth,
I've also had doubts about you.

668
01:13:49,234 --> 01:13:53,603
You tend to take drastic measures.

669
01:13:56,775 --> 01:14:04,238
However, your cooperation is
essential to finding Kira.

670
01:14:04,283 --> 01:14:11,212
If you want to work with us,
why don't you show yourself?

671
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:17,519
And then we could fight together.

672
01:14:18,297 --> 01:14:19,457
Fine.

673
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:20,760
Watari.

674
01:14:27,706 --> 01:14:31,699
I will take you to L.

675
01:15:39,613 --> 01:15:42,207
How do you do, I'm L.

676
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,954
I am Yagami.

677
01:16:05,138 --> 01:16:10,371
If I were Kira, you'd be dead by now.

678
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:12,207
What do you mean?

679
01:16:12,245 --> 01:16:14,338
From what we know so far...

680
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:16,645
Kira needs the names and features

681
01:16:16,683 --> 01:16:18,844
of the targets in order to kill them.

682
01:16:18,885 --> 01:16:23,288
From now on, do not
give out your real names.

683
01:16:23,323 --> 01:16:27,726
As for myself, call me Ryuzaki.

684
01:16:29,329 --> 01:16:30,591
Alright.

685
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:39,333
Kira can also manipulate
one's behaviour before death.

686
01:16:40,674 --> 01:16:47,307
The suicide notes written in jail
were probably Kira's experiment.

687
01:16:47,347 --> 01:16:48,644
Experiment?

688
01:16:48,682 --> 01:16:50,707
He tested them to see how accurately

689
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:54,743
he could kill the FBI agents.

690
01:16:54,788 --> 01:16:58,622
He's sent a message to me
through their suicide notes.

691
01:16:58,658 --> 01:17:00,922
Did Kira do that, too?

692
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,454
The agents died eight days after
this experiment.

693
01:17:05,498 --> 01:17:08,831
During that time, he somehow got

694
01:17:08,868 --> 01:17:12,531
the names from one particular agent.

695
01:17:12,972 --> 01:17:16,203
Kira is someone
within the authority...

696
01:17:16,242 --> 01:17:19,678
marked by the FBI,
before the experiment.

697
01:17:19,713 --> 01:17:21,510
Exactly.

698
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:24,949
That should be easy to narrow down.

699
01:17:24,984 --> 01:17:26,076
Sure.

700
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:34,722
Gathering from Kira's behaviour,
he is very immature and hates to lose.

701
01:17:36,062 --> 01:17:37,962
Just like me.

702
01:17:38,565 --> 01:17:42,558
I've been losing up till now
but things are going to change.

703
01:17:42,602 --> 01:17:48,097
Let's win this together.

704
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:49,938
Ryuzaki.

705
01:17:49,976 --> 01:17:55,573
This isn't a game,
this is an investigation.

706
01:17:55,615 --> 01:17:58,880
Our purpose is no different.

707
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:12,055
"Hi-jacker Killed in Accident"

708
01:18:32,685 --> 01:18:37,213
"11 a.m. Kyonan Bus"

709
01:18:44,697 --> 01:18:48,428
"Investigation Closed"

710
01:18:59,245 --> 01:19:01,975
I've collected all the tapes.

711
01:19:04,784 --> 01:19:08,311
The ones from the security camera.

712
01:19:08,354 --> 01:19:09,844
Thanks for the trouble.

713
01:19:45,692 --> 01:19:47,125
This is him.

714
01:19:49,896 --> 01:19:51,761
Oh yes, he was sitting at the back.

715
01:19:51,798 --> 01:19:53,095
I remember.

716
01:19:53,132 --> 01:19:56,260
He was quarrelling with a young man
when the robber came on the bus.

717
01:19:56,302 --> 01:19:58,668
What did this young man look like?

718
01:19:58,705 --> 01:20:04,769
Handsome.
Not that I have a thing for boys.

719
01:20:04,811 --> 01:20:10,716
Brave too. He didn't seem afraid
when the gun was pointed at him.

720
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,412
Was he questioned by the police?

721
01:20:13,453 --> 01:20:17,446
No. Actually, he disappeared.

722
01:20:19,025 --> 01:20:21,892
Maybe he didn't want to be involved, either.

723
01:20:23,396 --> 01:20:25,125
Here.

724
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:28,892
And this...

725
01:21:36,703 --> 01:21:39,900
You've narrowed down the list?

726
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:41,566
Yes.

727
01:21:41,607 --> 01:21:43,199
Who's on it?

728
01:21:57,623 --> 01:22:00,353
The Chief's and Deputy Chief's families.

729
01:22:01,127 --> 01:22:04,324
Why don't you explain?

730
01:22:06,032 --> 01:22:11,334
This is the moment of
Agent Iwamatsu's death.

731
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:15,501
As you can see,
he is pointing towards the train.

732
01:22:16,342 --> 01:22:18,105
Someone was on it?

733
01:22:18,144 --> 01:22:20,237
Presumably Kira.

734
01:22:28,287 --> 01:22:29,948
Who is she?

735
01:22:29,989 --> 01:22:32,116
Iwamatsu's fiancé.

736
01:22:33,459 --> 01:22:39,591
She was a talented FBI agent
who used to work under me.

737
01:22:40,266 --> 01:22:47,035
She probably noticed something unusual
and decided to follow him.

738
01:22:47,073 --> 01:22:50,065
Let's contact her right away.

739
01:22:50,109 --> 01:22:53,670
She's disappeared since his death.

740
01:22:53,713 --> 01:22:57,877
He must have been onto somebody.

741
01:22:57,917 --> 01:23:00,852
And we are one of them.

742
01:23:00,887 --> 01:23:05,085
With a probability of
less than three percent.

743
01:23:05,124 --> 01:23:06,557
Questioning us?

744
01:23:06,592 --> 01:23:08,082
No.

745
01:23:08,127 --> 01:23:15,124
We'll set up cameras and bugs
in both your houses.

746
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:19,002
We cannot allow
this kind of outrage.

747
01:23:19,038 --> 01:23:21,336
If this comes out, we're all fired.

748
01:23:21,374 --> 01:23:24,832
I thought we weren't afraid
to risk everything.

749
01:23:28,981 --> 01:23:31,916
Fine. Let's do it.

750
01:23:31,951 --> 01:23:33,145
Chief.

751
01:23:33,186 --> 01:23:36,883
Check for any blind spots,
and do it thoroughly.

752
01:23:36,923 --> 01:23:39,483
What about your wife and daughter?

753
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:44,224
I'm aware.

754
01:23:44,263 --> 01:23:46,959
But we'll never clear ourselves
if we avoid this.

755
01:23:46,999 --> 01:23:53,700
We'll set the cameras and bugs for,
shall we say, seven days.

756
01:23:53,739 --> 01:23:59,109
Why don't we have Chief
watch his own family then?

757
01:23:59,145 --> 01:24:00,942
Alright.

758
01:24:02,548 --> 01:24:06,211
Mr. Yagami and I will watch his house.

759
01:24:06,252 --> 01:24:10,120
Rest of you take turns
and watch Mr. Kitamura's.

760
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:36,141
This man...

761
01:24:36,182 --> 01:24:37,979
Recognise him?

762
01:24:39,485 --> 01:24:41,919
He was following Light.

763
01:24:42,989 --> 01:24:44,923
Something the matter?

764
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,187
He died.

765
01:24:52,231 --> 01:24:57,294
He was killed by Kira
while investigating the case.

766
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:06,170
Hey, Light.

767
01:25:06,212 --> 01:25:08,180
Why are you scheduling deaths
for weeks ahead?

768
01:25:08,214 --> 01:25:15,382
So as not to be suspected, in case
I'm hospitalised or tied up somehow.

769
01:25:16,155 --> 01:25:18,214
You think of everything.

770
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:21,722
Welcome to my show...

771
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:25,162
"Misamisa's Happy Sweets"

772
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:29,464
Here's what I'm making today.

773
01:25:30,203 --> 01:25:31,830
Can't wait.

774
01:25:31,871 --> 01:25:35,329
Fatten your friends with
croissant-pudding.

775
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:41,871
What is it?

776
01:25:42,815 --> 01:25:44,442
Nothing.

777
01:25:49,255 --> 01:25:54,056
You can fatten your rival in love
as much as five kilos.

778
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:59,129
My rival would be?
the pop star, Ai Otsuka.

779
01:25:59,565 --> 01:26:05,197
But I ended up getting fat instead.

780
01:26:05,238 --> 01:26:07,297
Now who the devil?

781
01:26:08,741 --> 01:26:11,938
Croissant-pudding completed.

782
01:26:11,978 --> 01:26:15,414
Let's make pigs out of our rivals in love.

783
01:26:15,448 --> 01:26:16,847
Excellent.

784
01:26:17,617 --> 01:26:20,677
Who do you respect the most?

785
01:26:22,722 --> 01:26:24,622
Kira.

786
01:26:24,657 --> 01:26:27,091
A follower of Kira, too?

787
01:26:27,126 --> 01:26:31,426
He's so cool being
the executioner and all.

788
01:26:31,464 --> 01:26:34,490
The youngsters should agree.

789
01:26:35,334 --> 01:26:40,203
Actually, Kira saved me.

790
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,433
What do you mean?

791
01:26:41,474 --> 01:26:45,240
Misa, I've told you
not to talk about Kira.

792
01:26:45,278 --> 01:26:47,337
Why can't I?

793
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,975
Please cut the bit about Kira.

794
01:26:51,851 --> 01:26:54,319
Where's my freedom?

795
01:26:56,088 --> 01:26:58,955
I can't ask about her private life?

796
01:26:58,991 --> 01:27:02,586
You can, but not on this subject.

797
01:27:02,628 --> 01:27:06,064
Everyone's talking about Kira.

798
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:09,896
Thank you all.

799
01:27:31,624 --> 01:27:33,057
Light.

800
01:27:43,569 --> 01:27:46,868
This is Miss Maki.

801
01:27:46,906 --> 01:27:50,205
She wants to ask you something.

802
01:27:52,345 --> 01:27:53,869
How do you do?

803
01:27:53,913 --> 01:27:55,039
Hello.

804
01:27:56,115 --> 01:27:58,948
I'm doing an article on Kira's case.

805
01:27:58,984 --> 01:28:03,148
I've heard you met Raye Iwamatsu.

806
01:28:04,457 --> 01:28:08,723
Remember the man on the bus
from the FBI?

807
01:28:11,297 --> 01:28:16,291
He was killed by Kira
while investigating the case.

808
01:28:16,335 --> 01:28:18,462
I didn't know.

809
01:28:18,504 --> 01:28:19,596
You didn't?

810
01:28:19,638 --> 01:28:24,302
He was the one following Light.

811
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:27,335
That's right.

812
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:30,645
Because he suspected you were Kira.

813
01:28:30,683 --> 01:28:35,586
Are you trying to say I killed him?

814
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:38,419
Kira can kill with a name.

815
01:28:38,457 --> 01:28:42,985
You've used the hi-jack to
find out Raye's name.

816
01:28:43,996 --> 01:28:46,624
That's funny.

817
01:28:46,665 --> 01:28:49,532
Did Raye die immediately afterwards?

818
01:28:49,568 --> 01:28:51,297
Three days later.

819
01:28:51,337 --> 01:28:58,766
If I were Kira, I would've killed him
as soon as I discovered his name.

820
01:28:58,811 --> 01:29:03,145
Light can't be Kira.

821
01:29:03,182 --> 01:29:05,309
You're wrong.

822
01:29:05,351 --> 01:29:07,546
And rude.

823
01:29:07,586 --> 01:29:09,747
I may sue you
so I'm putting down your words.

824
01:29:11,624 --> 01:29:14,616
Other agents died, too.

825
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:20,098
But if you killed Raye first,
you thought you would be suspected.

826
01:29:20,132 --> 01:29:23,192
That's why he wasn't killed
right away.

827
01:29:23,235 --> 01:29:25,135
Am I wrong?

828
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:27,731
All the agents died?

829
01:29:27,773 --> 01:29:30,105
I never heard that on the news.

830
01:29:30,142 --> 01:29:32,076
It was kept a secret.

831
01:29:34,246 --> 01:29:36,976
You're making it up.

832
01:29:37,383 --> 01:29:40,784
I didn't know she was such a person.

833
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:42,913
On the subway...

834
01:29:42,955 --> 01:29:47,153
you somehow found out the names

835
01:29:47,193 --> 01:29:49,024
of the agents and killed them all.

836
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,863
This is a waste of time. Let's go.

837
01:30:02,074 --> 01:30:04,008
Light Yagami.

838
01:30:04,944 --> 01:30:10,814
You can't kill me.
I've given you my false name.

839
01:30:13,085 --> 01:30:15,246
Go away.

840
01:30:16,288 --> 01:30:18,756
Raye was my fiancé.

841
01:30:20,025 --> 01:30:25,895
I'll hunt Kira down and won't stop
till I put him behind bars.

842
01:30:28,534 --> 01:30:30,627
What was that?

843
01:30:30,669 --> 01:30:32,637
She's insane.

844
01:30:33,939 --> 01:30:35,839
False name.

845
01:30:44,216 --> 01:30:48,380
Another one's on your tail.

846
01:30:50,322 --> 01:30:53,689
Sure you don't want my eyes?

847
01:30:56,161 --> 01:30:59,221
You're in deep trouble.

848
01:31:43,008 --> 01:31:50,881
The people who set-up the cameras told me
that Light checked for signs of entry.

849
01:31:53,218 --> 01:31:58,155
Other than that, we found
nothing suspicious in his room.

850
01:31:58,190 --> 01:32:01,682
Were all those cameras necessary?

851
01:32:01,727 --> 01:32:07,893
Light's characteristics,
his IQ and lifestyle...

852
01:32:07,933 --> 01:32:10,959
they all fit the profile.

853
01:32:11,003 --> 01:32:14,166
This is a waste of time.

854
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:20,039
If there's even a speck of doubt,
we must continue.

855
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:24,106
Without that determination,
we'll never catch Kira.

856
01:32:31,223 --> 01:32:36,126
Hey Light, talk to me.
No one's watching.

857
01:32:38,664 --> 01:32:40,791
Give me an apple.

858
01:32:40,833 --> 01:32:43,825
I demand one.

859
01:32:46,338 --> 01:32:48,898
Come on.

860
01:32:57,816 --> 01:32:59,306
Apples?

861
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:07,921
What's wrong?

862
01:33:09,862 --> 01:33:14,060
L's onto me completely.

863
01:33:14,099 --> 01:33:16,795
Someone's been in my room.
I smell it.

864
01:33:16,835 --> 01:33:22,398
There are cameras and bugs
hidden everywhere.

865
01:33:26,845 --> 01:33:31,578
L wasn't so easy to deal with after all.

866
01:33:31,617 --> 01:33:35,986
As long as I'm being watched,
there are no apples for you.

867
01:33:36,388 --> 01:33:38,481
What?

868
01:33:39,224 --> 01:33:43,558
Let's look for the cameras
and find a blind spot.

869
01:34:16,495 --> 01:34:22,525
Your son is a hard worker.
You must be very proud.

870
01:34:25,237 --> 01:34:28,434
He wishes to join the Police Agency.

871
01:34:30,409 --> 01:34:34,368
How will my son be cleared?

872
01:34:34,413 --> 01:34:37,678
If he does nothing suspicious,

873
01:34:37,716 --> 01:34:41,049
and there's a murder by Kira.

874
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,356
You want us to wait for a murder?

875
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:47,415
It seems so.

876
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:53,225
Have one.

877
01:35:02,941 --> 01:35:05,876
DAY THREE

878
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,340
It's dinnertime.

879
01:35:24,029 --> 01:35:25,860
I'm taking a break.

880
01:35:38,343 --> 01:35:42,245
Chief, you must rest.

881
01:35:42,281 --> 01:35:45,307
You haven't slept in three days.

882
01:35:46,351 --> 01:35:51,220
How could I,
when my family are being suspected.

883
01:36:00,999 --> 01:36:03,126
Yes? Understood.

884
01:36:09,508 --> 01:36:14,138
We have confirmed the deaths of...

885
01:36:14,179 --> 01:36:19,139
three killers that were on the run,
and two convicts on death row.

886
01:36:19,184 --> 01:36:21,209
Is that so?

887
01:36:22,454 --> 01:36:24,422
Not too fast.

888
01:36:26,024 --> 01:36:30,427
Have you forgotten
that Kira can manipulate time?

889
01:36:32,097 --> 01:36:38,332
We won't know for sure
until a new crime is reported.

890
01:36:52,551 --> 01:36:56,920
DAY FIVE

891
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,957
DAY SEVEN

892
01:37:39,998 --> 01:37:42,466
Aren't you worried?

893
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:44,969
Dad hasn't come home in a week.

894
01:37:45,003 --> 01:37:46,800
I'm used to it.

895
01:37:47,706 --> 01:37:50,675
Father's hard at work.
You should be, too.

896
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:52,199
Okay.

897
01:37:54,446 --> 01:37:58,473
Eating chips after dinner
You're going to get fat.

898
01:37:58,517 --> 01:38:02,954
I'll be up all night studying.
I need my strength.

899
01:38:02,988 --> 01:38:04,216
Thanks for dinner.

900
01:38:54,139 --> 01:38:58,735
We have just received
new information.

901
01:38:58,777 --> 01:39:03,407
The suspect accused of kidnapping
a five-year-old girl in Edogawa...

902
01:39:03,448 --> 01:39:06,178
has been arrested.

903
01:39:06,218 --> 01:39:13,715
Toru Kashimayama, age 29,
allegedly kidnapped Kasumi Miuchizawa.

904
01:39:13,759 --> 01:39:18,662
Her body was found buried
under the floor of his apartment.

905
01:39:18,697 --> 01:39:23,760
On the 28th of last month, Kasumi was
playing in a park near her home...

906
01:39:23,802 --> 01:39:33,473
where she was last seen
climbing into a red car.

907
01:39:33,512 --> 01:39:36,379
He's not watching the news.

908
01:40:05,377 --> 01:40:09,814
Something seems to have happened
at the scene.

909
01:40:09,848 --> 01:40:11,372
Mr. Murai

910
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:13,646
Live from Funabori.

911
01:40:13,685 --> 01:40:18,315
Kashimayama has just died.

912
01:40:18,356 --> 01:40:21,052
According to information...

913
01:40:21,093 --> 01:40:26,156
Kashimayama was said to have been
in the middle of an interrogation...

914
01:40:26,198 --> 01:40:30,294
when he suddenly died of
heart attack.

915
01:40:30,335 --> 01:40:32,803
Mr. Murai?

916
01:40:32,838 --> 01:40:36,330
Do you suspect Kira?

917
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:42,711
The cause of death is still unknown,
but there is that possibility.

918
01:40:42,747 --> 01:40:44,977
This is Kira's latest crime.

919
01:40:45,016 --> 01:40:47,814
Light is no longer under suspicion.

920
01:40:48,753 --> 01:40:51,916
Isn't that enough?

921
01:41:26,224 --> 01:41:30,524
"TORU KASHIMAYAMA"

922
01:41:30,795 --> 01:41:34,390
The Chief's and Deputy Chief's families
are cleared.

923
01:41:35,967 --> 01:41:40,336
Ryuzaki, aren't you satisfied?

924
01:41:44,342 --> 01:41:48,870
Recover all the bugs and cameras
from their houses.

925
01:41:48,914 --> 01:41:50,745
Understood.

926
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:54,350
You must be relieved, Chief.

927
01:41:54,386 --> 01:41:56,650
It'll be a fresh start.

928
01:42:14,839 --> 01:42:18,900
Light, the cameras are all gone.

929
01:42:40,765 --> 01:42:44,201
There's nothing like
eating apples...

930
01:42:44,236 --> 01:42:46,295
free from the public eye.

931
01:42:50,141 --> 01:42:52,974
But Light.

932
01:42:53,011 --> 01:42:57,914
What if your sister had taken
that bag of chips?

933
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:03,714
I'm the only one
who likes consommé flavour.

934
01:43:33,084 --> 01:43:37,384
A phone call from Naomi Misora.

935
01:43:40,859 --> 01:43:42,486
It's been a while.

936
01:43:45,897 --> 01:43:51,631
As of now, I will prove to you
that Light Yagami is Kira...

937
01:43:52,604 --> 01:43:54,697
by risking my life.

938
01:44:10,322 --> 01:44:12,051
Hello?

939
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:14,490
Can we meet?

940
01:44:14,526 --> 01:44:15,618
Where?

941
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:16,922
The art gallery.

942
01:44:16,961 --> 01:44:19,930
I was just thinking about you.

943
01:44:21,299 --> 01:44:23,358
When can you come?

944
01:44:24,436 --> 01:44:28,770
I can leave right now so...
in 30 minutes.

945
01:44:29,841 --> 01:44:31,570
Light...

946
01:44:32,644 --> 01:44:34,635
You sound strange.

947
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:42,311
Shiori?

948
01:44:55,133 --> 01:44:59,069
We're monitoring the art gallery.

949
01:44:59,104 --> 01:45:01,004
Let me see it.

950
01:45:13,718 --> 01:45:15,379
I'm at the entrance.

951
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:17,285
Come inside.

952
01:45:17,322 --> 01:45:21,725
I'll be by Ekusuhso Kenak's
"Mask and Death".

953
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,250
Alright.

954
01:45:27,665 --> 01:45:30,429
We can see how Kira kills?

955
01:45:30,468 --> 01:45:33,403
What do you mean by that?

956
01:45:42,747 --> 01:45:44,374
Light?

957
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:48,813
I knew it. Kira is Light.

958
01:45:51,923 --> 01:45:55,256
Is my son still a suspect?

959
01:46:11,776 --> 01:46:13,801
Forgive me.

960
01:46:13,845 --> 01:46:15,540
Light Yagami.

961
01:46:16,714 --> 01:46:21,913
If you want to see her alive,
confess right now.

962
01:46:23,455 --> 01:46:25,423
That you've killed Raye.

963
01:46:26,491 --> 01:46:28,857
And that you are Kira.

964
01:46:32,664 --> 01:46:34,131
Get some police in there.

965
01:46:38,036 --> 01:46:40,402
You've got it all wrong.

966
01:46:40,438 --> 01:46:41,905
I'm not Kira.

967
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:44,408
If you keep on lying...

968
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:47,372
I'll kill her.

969
01:46:47,412 --> 01:46:48,936
No.

970
01:46:49,514 --> 01:46:52,915
Even if I were,
she has nothing to do with it.

971
01:46:52,951 --> 01:46:55,351
Kill me instead.

972
01:46:55,386 --> 01:47:00,221
I'll teach you the pain of
losing your loved one.

973
01:47:00,258 --> 01:47:01,885
Don't do it.

974
01:47:02,794 --> 01:47:04,853
Please, not Shiori.

975
01:47:04,896 --> 01:47:06,295
Light...

976
01:47:07,632 --> 01:47:09,827
How miserable you are.

977
01:47:10,869 --> 01:47:17,035
The almighty Kira,
begging for his girlfriend's life.

978
01:47:17,075 --> 01:47:20,374
I'm telling you, I'm not Kira.

979
01:47:20,411 --> 01:47:22,174
You can't kill without a name.

980
01:47:22,213 --> 01:47:23,942
I'll tell you mine.

981
01:47:27,752 --> 01:47:30,380
Naomi Misora.

982
01:47:31,623 --> 01:47:41,521
Naomi is in katakana characters,
and Misora, Chinese ones.

983
01:47:42,567 --> 01:47:49,564
Now that you know my name,
go ahead and kill me!

984
01:47:56,447 --> 01:47:58,540
Naomi Misora...

985
01:48:01,686 --> 01:48:02,414
The police?

986
01:48:02,453 --> 01:48:03,943
They're almost there.

987
01:48:03,988 --> 01:48:06,923
No, hold them back a little longer.

988
01:48:06,958 --> 01:48:08,289
What?

989
01:48:08,326 --> 01:48:10,021
Here's the good part.

990
01:48:10,061 --> 01:48:14,088
How dare you! This isn't a show.

991
01:48:14,832 --> 01:48:17,528
You want to save her?

992
01:48:17,569 --> 01:48:19,764
Then kill me.

993
01:48:20,605 --> 01:48:23,165
Like you did Raye.

994
01:48:23,207 --> 01:48:26,768
Like all the criminals
you've executed.

995
01:48:26,811 --> 01:48:31,680
Go on and kill
without laying a hand on me!

996
01:48:31,716 --> 01:48:34,514
But I'm not Kira.

997
01:49:30,642 --> 01:49:33,110
Please... no.

998
01:49:36,981 --> 01:49:40,075
This can't be happening.

999
01:49:52,597 --> 01:49:54,087
She's armed.

1000
01:50:15,019 --> 01:50:19,581
That was... our last kiss.

1001
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:36,973
Why?

1002
01:50:38,209 --> 01:50:40,507
Why did you shoot her?

1003
01:50:41,412 --> 01:50:45,405
Tell me.

1004
01:50:54,959 --> 01:50:56,290
Stop.

1005
01:51:06,804 --> 01:51:10,934
This was a miscalculation.

1006
01:51:11,476 --> 01:51:18,439
Naomi Misora's miscalculation was
that I saw her.

1007
01:51:18,483 --> 01:51:24,319
She also shouldn't have told me
she was Raye's fiancé.

1008
01:51:25,056 --> 01:51:28,048
Nobody uses false names on weddings.

1009
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:31,920
The church is open to everyone,

1010
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:36,796
so it was easy to find out her name.

1011
01:51:43,474 --> 01:51:46,602
Naomi Misora, suicide.

1012
01:51:47,345 --> 01:51:53,113
Arranges to meet with
her fiancé's killer.

1013
01:51:53,151 --> 01:51:59,750
Takes his girlfriend hostage
at the Omei Art Gallery.

1014
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:05,889
She makes the girlfriend call him
on April 15th, 14:15.

1015
01:52:07,298 --> 01:52:13,362
She then contacts a third party;
the Investigation Team...

1016
01:52:13,404 --> 01:52:19,434
and tries to make the killer confess
as they watch.

1017
01:52:20,178 --> 01:52:26,742
At 14:55, she stops
the hostage from running away...

1018
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:35,055
but in a moment of madness,
ends up shooting herself.

1019
01:52:56,247 --> 01:52:57,839
I'm sorry.

1020
01:52:59,717 --> 01:53:03,084
If only we'd gotten here earlier.

1021
01:53:08,726 --> 01:53:11,058
I'll send for a car.

1022
01:53:17,869 --> 01:53:22,499
Didn't expect Shiori to die,
did you?

1023
01:53:31,015 --> 01:53:36,282
I'm the one who killed Shiori.

1024
01:53:38,556 --> 01:53:41,889
With the help of Death Note.

1025
01:53:41,926 --> 01:53:44,588
But how?

1026
01:53:45,129 --> 01:53:50,761
Naomi ended up killing Shiori,
but you can't make people kill.

1027
01:53:51,569 --> 01:53:56,939
If you write their names,
they'd all die of heart attacks.

1028
01:53:57,375 --> 01:53:59,866
I know.

1029
01:54:01,178 --> 01:54:08,016
That's why I wrote Shiori's name
on the page next to Naomi's.

1030
01:54:17,628 --> 01:54:22,497
Shiori Akino,
killed by a third person.

1031
01:54:24,035 --> 01:54:28,301
Get's kidnapped
at the Omei Art Gallery.

1032
01:54:28,339 --> 01:54:36,269
On April 15th, 14:15, she is
forced to call up her boyfriend.

1033
01:54:37,315 --> 01:54:41,684
She gets away
as the police break in.

1034
01:54:41,719 --> 01:54:43,311
But at 14:55,
a warning shot hits her...

1035
01:54:43,354 --> 01:54:51,591
and she dies trying to protect
her boyfriend.

1036
01:54:54,465 --> 01:54:57,832
It didn't have to say anything about
Naomi shooting Shiori or vice versa.

1037
01:54:58,402 --> 01:55:01,894
It didn't have to say anything about
Naomi shooting Shiori or vice versa.

1038
01:55:01,939 --> 01:55:07,138
Does that mean,
Naomi just happened to kill Shiori?

1039
01:55:07,178 --> 01:55:09,646
A coincidence?

1040
01:55:10,815 --> 01:55:16,811
That's hardly a perfect scheme
for killing Shiori.

1041
01:55:17,521 --> 01:55:21,821
It was no coincidence.
I planned everything.

1042
01:55:23,494 --> 01:55:30,024
All I wrote was that
Shiori would be killed by a gunshot.

1043
01:55:30,067 --> 01:55:35,767
And that Naomi would carry a gun
in order to shoot herself.

1044
01:55:35,806 --> 01:55:40,209
No one carries a gun around
in Japan...

1045
01:55:40,244 --> 01:55:46,376
which means that the gun Naomi has,
would be shot at Shiori.

1046
01:55:48,853 --> 01:55:51,083
Hear this.

1047
01:55:51,122 --> 01:55:57,027
"Death Note" changes our destinies
in the most natural way.

1048
01:55:57,995 --> 01:56:01,522
So even though it wasn't written,

1049
01:56:02,233 --> 01:56:05,202
everything went according to my plan.

1050
01:56:05,236 --> 01:56:09,468
You're a devil in disguise.

1051
01:56:14,645 --> 01:56:18,877
My girlfriend was killed
before my eyes.

1052
01:56:18,916 --> 01:56:24,479
If I tell them I want to
join the team and capture Kira...

1053
01:56:24,522 --> 01:56:30,222
everyone would sympathize and
believe me without a doubt.

1054
01:56:41,238 --> 01:56:43,172
Light, you know what?

1055
01:56:43,207 --> 01:56:50,113
You're far worse than god of death.

1056
01:56:52,883 --> 01:56:57,081
Shiori truly loved you.

1057
01:56:58,689 --> 01:57:03,388
Didn't you love her at all?

1058
01:57:07,965 --> 01:57:10,525
I don't know.

1059
01:57:19,577 --> 01:57:23,069
Misa, I know you're lonely.

1060
01:57:23,114 --> 01:57:25,514
Don't come close to me.

1061
01:57:25,549 --> 01:57:29,417
You're the one who said
you wanted to die.

1062
01:57:29,453 --> 01:57:31,717
I didn't say such a thing.

1063
01:57:31,755 --> 01:57:35,156
Let's go to heaven.
Your parents are waiting.

1064
01:57:35,192 --> 01:57:37,057
We'll go together.

1065
01:57:40,397 --> 01:57:43,389
You're an assistant director.

1066
01:57:44,235 --> 01:57:48,331
I'll tell, and you'll lose
your job forever!

1067
01:57:48,806 --> 01:57:54,108
I've been watching you
at the studio, in the hallway.

1068
01:57:54,745 --> 01:57:58,181
We'll die together.
I'm giving you my life.

1069
01:57:59,216 --> 01:58:01,207
That's my destiny.

1070
01:58:01,252 --> 01:58:02,685
Idiot.

1071
01:58:03,521 --> 01:58:08,584
Who said I want to go to heaven
or to hell?

1072
01:58:15,533 --> 01:58:19,367
Don't worry. It won't hurt a bit.

1073
01:58:20,104 --> 01:58:22,072
No...

1074
01:58:23,674 --> 01:58:27,474
Somebody. Help me.

1075
01:59:35,145 --> 01:59:38,239
Light, your car's here.

1076
01:59:41,785 --> 01:59:44,549
Let's get you home.

1077
01:59:44,588 --> 01:59:48,615
Father, I have a request.

1078
01:59:48,659 --> 01:59:50,354
What is it?

1079
01:59:51,095 --> 01:59:54,121
Let me on the team.

1080
01:59:56,467 --> 02:00:00,369
Shiori was killed because of Kira.

1081
02:00:01,739 --> 02:00:04,469
I'll never forgive him.

1082
02:00:04,508 --> 02:00:08,740
So please put me on the team.

1083
02:00:11,348 --> 02:00:13,077
We welcome you.

1084
02:00:22,092 --> 02:00:25,186
We meet at last.

1085
02:00:27,898 --> 02:00:29,889
I am L.

1086
02:00:33,404 --> 02:00:35,736
Lend us your brain.

1087
02:00:39,076 --> 02:00:42,045
We'll capture Kira together.

1088
02:00:57,728 --> 02:01:01,494
First, apologise.
