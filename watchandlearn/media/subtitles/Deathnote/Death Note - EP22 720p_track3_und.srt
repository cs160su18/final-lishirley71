WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

91
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,590
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,730
And once you realize that I am Kira, we're getting married!

93
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,090
So, as you can all hear... Higuchi is Kira!

94
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,690
So, as you can all hear... Higuchi is Kira!

95
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,650
Guidance

96
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,370
If the killing of criminals cease now, there would be no doubt that Higuchi has Kira's power.

97
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,960
If the killing of criminals cease now, there would be no doubt that Higuchi has Kira's power.

98
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
However... although I've always thought that Amane would go a long way to help Yagami Light out

99
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,190
However... although I've always thought that Amane would go a long way to help Yagami Light out,

100
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,620
I never realized she'd go this far.

101
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,230
Now that she's gone this far and stopped the killings... it'll become even more difficult to witness the actual method they use to kill.

102
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,640
Now that she's gone this far and stopped the killings... it'll become even more difficult to witness the actual method they use to kill.

103
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,270
I need to think of a plan...

104
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,460
Misa, how did you manage to get Higuchi to confess?

105
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,650
Misa, how did you manage to get Higuchi to confess?

106
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,450
Huh? Oh, that guy's totally crazy about Misa.

107
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,800
Huh? Oh, that guy's totally crazy about Misa.

108
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,520
I told him that I'd marry Kira.

109
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,030
Plus, he's already convinced that Misa is the second Kira.

110
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,830
Unless I say this now, I might end up contradicting myself later on...

111
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,830
Idiot!

112
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,710
Didn't I tell you to deny that, no matter what?!

113
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,330
B-But now we know Higuchi is Kira. All we've got to do is catch him.

114
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,010
B-But now we know Higuchi is Kira. All we've got to do is catch him.

115
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,180
This is what you might call "nice work", right, Matsuda-san?

116
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,470
Yet, as things stand, we're still no closer to discovering how he kills.

117
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,790
Yet, as things stand, we're still no closer to discovering how he kills.

118
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,710
Yeah, that's right.

119
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,600
Before I capture him, I want to know how he kills...

120
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,740
And if the killing of criminals cease, you won't be able to see how he kills, isn't that right?

121
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,710
Yes. In any case, even though we're going to capture Higuchi,

122
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes. In any case, even though we're going to capture Higuchi,

123
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,880
that won't be until after we've determined that the judging of criminals has ceased.

124
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,910
Please allow me to think about this...

125
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,830
Weddy?

126
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,230
Yes?

127
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,400
How's the situation?

128
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,760
It's looking good.

129
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,390
The movements of those seven can be tracked about 70% of the time, while inside the company building.

130
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,300
What about outside of the company?

131
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,970
With just Watari and myself, it's impossible.

132
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,020
What if we were to solely focus on Higuchi?

133
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,980
Higuchi?

134
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,700
So far, I've only entered five of their houses, but Midou, Namikawa and Higuchi's houses have security systems that aren't normal.

135
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,450
So far, I've only entered five of their houses, but Midou, Namikawa and Higuchi's houses have security systems that aren't normal.

136

So far, I've only entered five of their houses, but Midou, Namikawa and Higuchi's houses have security systems that aren't normal.

137
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,620
So far, I've only entered five of their houses, but Midou, Namikawa and Higuchi's houses have security systems that aren't normal.

138
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,470
In particular, Higuchi has recently build a basement that blocks electromagnetic waves.

139
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,240
It even took me a full two days to infiltrate that place.

140
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,860
Just as we thought, Higuchi is definitely suspicious.

141
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,970
Understood. In that case, install bugging equipment, transmitters and cameras in Higuchi's car rather than his house.

142
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:57,260
Understood. In that case, install bugging equipment, transmitters and cameras in Higuchi's car rather than his house.

143
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,130
Eh?! After going through all that?!

144
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,220
Do you have any idea of how hard it is to break into someone's house?!

145
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,420
Besides, do you even know how many cars Higuchi owns?!

146
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,350
Six.

147
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,100
Okay, fine. You want me to do all of them, right?

148
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,930
Yes please.

149
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,660
Woah... if they had done that a little earlier, it would have been dangerous...

150
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,670
Yagami-kun... I'm sorry to bring this up again, but let me ask you this directly:

151
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,700
Yagami-kun... I'm sorry to bring this up again, but let me ask you this directly:

152
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,170
Yagami-kun... I'm sorry to bring this up again, but let me ask you this directly:

153
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,120
What is it?

154
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,960
Do you remember killing them?

155
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,640
You still insist on saying that?! I am not Kira!

156
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,190
You still insist on saying that?! I am not Kira!

157
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,810
How many times do I have to te--

158
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
Please, just answer the question.

159
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,040
Do you remember?

160
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,580
I don't remember.

161
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,930
What about Misa-san?

162
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,310
I don't remember anything because I'm not Kira!

163
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,090
Yagami-kun, I need you to consider these assumptions and analyze it earnestly.

164
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,860
Yagami-kun, I need you to consider these assumptions and analyze it earnestly.

165
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,280
Your answer may be the first step in capturing Kira.

166
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,230
Yagami Light was Kira.

167
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,080
Kira's powers were then transferred to someone else.

168
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,630
Now Yagami Light has absolutely no memory of being Kira.

169
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,210
That will be the premise behind this analysis.

170
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,510
Will you be able to think on that basis?

171
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,300
Yeah, I'll give it a try.

172
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,140
Yagami Light was Kira.

173
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,820
Kira's powers were then transferred to someone else.

174
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,030
Was this transfer done by Yagami Light's own will?

175
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:47,360
Or was there someone else behind Yagami Light, who bestowed Kira's power, and transferred that power from Yagami Light to another?

176
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,410
With those presumptions... it'd have been by Yagami Light's own will.

177
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,750
With those presumptions... it'd have been by Yagami Light's own will.

178
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,590
That's right...

179
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,710
If there was a human behind the scenes who could bestow and transfer that power... and they didn't want their methods discovered...

180
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,270
It's a little suspicious that they hadn't transferred until right at the very last moment...

181
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,240
And if we accept the existence of something that could look down on us from heaven, there would be no way to catch it.

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,200
And if we accept the existence of something that could look down on us from heaven, there would be no way to catch it.

183
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,870
I would either have died a long time ago, or I'd be spending eternity being toyed with in the palm of their hand.

184
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,420
I would either have died a long time ago, or I'd be spending eternity being toyed with in the palm of their hand.

185
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,120
There's no way that something like that exists.

186
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,020
Even if Yagami Light was Kira...

187
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,050
Only the current Kira can use that power.

188
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,000
Yagami-kun... thanks to that, I'm feeling 99% better.

189
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,020
Yagami-kun... thanks to that, I'm feeling 99% better.

190
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,180
We'll create a situation where Higuchi will not pass the power on to anyone else... and let him show us how he kills people.

191
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,120
We'll create a situation where Higuchi will not pass the power on to anyone else... and let him show us how he kills people.

192
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,300
What are you planning?

193
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,780
I'm going to use Sakura TV to trap Higuchi.

194
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,000
Dokkiri TV is the Japanese version of Candid Camera.

195
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,030
You mean Dokkiri TV?!

196
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,000
What's that?

197
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,830
We'll utilize the "Kira Special" that Demegawa continues to broadcast.

198
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:30,910
We'll arrange a three-hour show, and at the beginning of it, we'll announce that "We'll reveal Kira's identity by the end of this show!"

199
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,850
Is he going to believe that? After all, it's on Sakura TV, right?

200
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,430
Besides, Higuchi might not even watch that program.

201
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,440
All we've got to do is contact Namikawa and ask him to call Higuchi and say: "There's trouble brewing, turn on the TV".

202
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:51,780
If Higuchi sees someone who may know his secret, he'll believe it.

203
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,280
I see! You're planning to use Aiber.

204
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,280
You're going to reveal that in reality he was a spy!

205
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,850
No, you're totally wrong. I'm not planning to use Aiber.

206
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,160
No, you're totally wrong. I'm not planning to use Aiber.

207
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:10,630
The person Higuchi sees on TV needs to be someone that he thinks he'll be able to kill, otherwise there's no point.

208
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,490
To be blunt, it has to be someone whose name he thinks he could quickly and easily find if he tries.

209
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,820
Is there even such a person around?

210
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,870
It's got to be Matsuda-san.

211
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,710
Matsu!

212
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,350
Matsuda, huh?

213
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,430
Higuchi believes that you were trying to eavesdrop on their meeting,

214
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,530
so if the supposedly dead manager begins to threaten to expose everything, he'll believe it.

215
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,160
He's right.

216
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,830
We'll get Sakura TV to prepare a screen and a microphone the way they usually do with witnesses.

217
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,890
From the silhouette and from what's being said, Higuchi should be able to work out that it's "Manager Matsui".

218
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,460
Furthermore, we'll have the station "slip up" and momentarily reveal the face of the person behind the screen.

219
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,850
Cool! Sounds fun!

220
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,760
And he'll announce that by the end of the show, he'll reveal the full identity of "H", better known as Kira.

221
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,220
Kira's identity will be announced at the end of this show!

222
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,180
Placed in that situation, all Higuchi will be concerned about, is how fast he'll be able to find out the manager's real name.

223
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,520
We can predict Higuchi's actions.

224
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,980
And then, we'll be able to confirm exactly how he's been killing people.

225
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,400
If this plan has a flaw, it's that...

226
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,220
If Higuchi is similar to the second Kira, and can kill someone solely by knowing their face...

227
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,490
If Higuchi is similar to the second Kira, and can kill someone solely by knowing their face...

228
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,930
Matsuda-san will die.

229
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,270
But given that Matsuda-san is still alive, and that Higuchi wants Misa, I'd say it was unlikely.

230
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,210
But given that Matsuda-san is still alive, and that Higuchi wants Misa, I'd say it was unlikely.

231
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,210
But given that Matsuda-san is still alive, and that Higuchi wants Misa, I'd say it was unlikely.

232
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,910
We'll only be using this plan if criminals stop dying though.

233
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,050
We'll need to give it two to three days to be sure.

234
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,650
You can make your own decision on whether or not to go ahead with it during this time, Matsuda-san.

235
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,190
I don't need two or three days.

236
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,980
Please, allow me to do it.

237
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,380
So, what's the deal with this secret meeting then?

238
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,790
Namikawa, who do you think is Kira?

239
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,550
Namikawa, who do you think is Kira?

240
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,680
What's the point in asking that?

241
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,800
It could even be you, Shimura, or you, Midou.

242
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,150
No, it's not Shimura.

243
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,480
He came crying to me about how he could no longer go along with Kira's evil ways.

244
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,730
Shimura, if Midou was Kira, you'd be dead.

245
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,400
Shimura, if Midou was Kira, you'd be dead.

246
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,740
No, you and Midou would have had successful lives regardless of all this.

247
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,250
Neither of you would do something so stupid as to call an eight-person meeting to discuss murder.

248
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,720
Even I am able to figure out that much.

249
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,960
The only reason everyone's going along with this is because they're all scared of being killed by Kira.

250
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,040
But if we continue this way, we'll be caught sooner or later.

251
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,720
No, in fact, unless that happens, it'll never end.

252
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,470
Well then, Shimura, let me ask you the same question. Who do you think is Kira?

253
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,480
Takahashi or Higuchi.

254
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Takahashi merely acts as a foil for Kira, it's necessary that Kira has someone who's not as smart as him.

255
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,830
Seems like everyone has already figured this out...

256
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,360
It's likely that it's Higuchi.

257
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,780
Yeah. Higuchi is the one who desires money and promotion the most.

258
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,740
Yeah. Higuchi is the one who desires money and promotion the most.

259
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,610
He's always talking about how he doesn't care for promotion, but conversely this just shows how hung up he really is about it.

260
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,980
He's always talking about how he doesn't care for promotion, but conversely this just shows how hung up he really is about it.

261
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,100
He berates people, but doesn't know how to manage them,

262
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,920
and as a result he has been demoted from Director of Development to merely the Head of a Development lab.

263
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,470
Am I the only one who you've asked to come here?

264
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,980
We asked Ooi, but he said that we're free to have our pathetic little meeting without him.

265
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,810
We asked Ooi, but he said that we're free to have our pathetic little meeting without him.

266
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,990
Typical of Ooi, always brash.

267
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,820
Since Kida had to organize Coil's commission, plus the finances for it, he's not Kira either.

268
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,030
Since Kida had to organize Coil's commission, plus the finances for it, he's not Kira either.

269
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,430
Namikawa, after Hatori died, you received a phone call during the next meeting... who was it?

270
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,720
Namikawa, after Hatori died, you received a phone call during the next meeting... who was it?

271
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,530
Namikawa, after Hatori died, you received a phone call during the next meeting... who was it?

272
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,740
Namikawa, after Hatori died, you received a phone call during the next meeting... who was it?

273
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,930
Shimura, you're really shrewd, aren't you?

274
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,580
Kira must have chosen you for your prudence.

275
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,760
Namikawa.

276
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,210
This is L. Namikawa-san, are you alone right now?

277
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,390
This is L. Namikawa-san, are you alone right now?

278
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,580
No...

279
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,680
In that case, please act naturally like before.

280
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,520
There's no need for that.

281
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,170
Currently, I'm with some people who've realized that the call I received from you during that meeting was odd.

282
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,360
Who's on the phone, Namikawa?

283
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,020
It's L.

284
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,490
L, I've got both Midou and Shimura with me.

285
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,700
It's unlikely that either of them is Kira, and both are annoyed with Kira.

286
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,860
Whatever happens, they're both happy to sit on the sidelines and watch this thing between L and Kira unfold, just like me.

287
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,830
That's fine.

288
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,710
Tonight, we'll capture Kira, but we'll need your help.

289
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,010
So, this is the end for Higuchi...

290
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,290
You knew?

291
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,470
I guess even L can be tricked.

292
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,690
Thanks to your response, I'm now 100% sure that it's Higuchi.

293
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,780
Namikawa's pretty good! Looking at his face, Misa thought he might be smart...

294
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,370
Namikawa's pretty good! Looking at his face, Misa thought he might be smart...

295
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,300
No, that was a mistake on Yagami-kun's part.

296
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,700
Tonight, we'll be using the "Kira Special" shown on Sakura TV at 7 pm to force Higuchi's hand.

297
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,670
I need you to contact Higuchi a few minutes after the program has started, and tell him to watch the TV.

298
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,660
I promise that the remaining six of you won't be adversely affected.

299
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,530
If Kida, Takahashi or Ooi attempt anything... I need you to stop them.

300
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,690
If Kida, Takahashi or Ooi attempt anything... I need you to stop them.

301
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,990
Okay...

302
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,130
Looks like it really is Higuchi.

303
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,850
He'll probably be caught tonight.

304
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,290
It's been three days since I stopped judging criminals.

305
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,680
That should be enough...

306
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:15,330
If I marry the second Kira, Amane, I'll have the Shinigami's Eyes, and I'll be able to control Yotsuba completely!

307
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,010
Higuchi, this looks bad. Turn on Sakura TV.

308
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,600
So, you're saying one of them is Kira, right?

309
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,390
Yes, and I've got plenty of proof.

310
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,950
What the hell is this?

311
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,900
It's bound to be fake. After all, this is Sakura TV we're talking about.

312
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,240
At the beginning of the program he stated; "I overheard a meeting between eight people".

313
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,690
Someone who knows about the meetings?!

314
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,500
Who?! Has someone betrayed us?!

315
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,120
Who?! Has someone betrayed us?!

316
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,970
And then one of them was killed, so now there's only seven.

317
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,160
The victim was Mr. "H".

318
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,210
"H"? Hatori...

319
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,510
"H"? Hatori...

320
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,540
Knowing this much, he's either one of the other six... or Coil.

321
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,850
Knowing this much, he's either one of the other six... or Coil.

322
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,170
Knowing this much, he's either one of the other six... or Coil.

323
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,280
Mr. "H" was killed because he wanted out of those meetings.

324
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,690
No, none of them would gain a thing from doing this.

325
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,340
Yet, there shouldn't be anyone else who'd know about these meetings...

326
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,840
T-This guy...

327
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,360
I-It's him?!

328
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,910
He used to be Misa's manager, I think his name was Matsui. Why the hell is he still alive?!

329
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,730
He gambled on faking a fall from a high rise apartment, because he thought he was going to be killed,

330
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,340
and escaped by landing on the veranda on the floor below, or so he said earlier.

331
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:52,820
No, afterwards I wrote the name on his business card into the Death Note, just in case...

332
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,010
Why is he still alive?!

333
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,340
Perhaps he was in the business previously, and kept his stage name when he became a manager... or something...

334
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,180
I don't get it!

335
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,110
In addition, he says that he's been investigating Yotsuba and knows who Kira is.

336
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,730
I'm in the process of contacting everyone now.

337
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,360
Okay, I'll hang up for now.

338
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,610
About the accident just now, are you alright? Would you like to stop?

339
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,030
About the accident just now, are you alright? Would you like to stop?

340
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,240
About the accident just now, are you alright? Would you like to stop?

341
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,370
No, I knew that I'd be letting myself in for trouble from the beginning.

342
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,270
Even if I die, I'll try my best until the end - in the name of justice!

343
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:32,050
Nice, nice... as long as you ensure you don't make the announcement until the end of the program.

344
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,920
I've got no choice but to kill him!

345
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,110
The second Kira, Misa, will know his name as well as his face...

346
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,900
It's here!

347
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,000
What the hell is going on?!

348
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,500
It's taken me a while to come to this decision and make this announcement, but ever since I found out the truth,

349
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,260
I've felt that as a human being, I must persevere.

350
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,610
This is bad... I could be exposed at any moment.

351
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,420
That announcement isn't far off now. Stay tuned!

352
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,640
Cosme Misa. Brilliant gloss.

353
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,990
An angel's sparkle. Misa's Cashmere Rouge.

354
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,940
Midou? It's me. Sakura TV is causing trouble.

355
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,310
Your father is in the House of Councillors, right?

356
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,300
Get him to put pressure on the Ministry of Public Affairs and put a stop to this program.

357
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,560
I'm watching it too, and it would be impossible.

358
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,420
No one is going to believe this, and doing that will just make it look suspicious.

359
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,070
Anyway, there's no need to worry.

360
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,570
His face was on TV, so we were able to identify him as Matsui Tarou.

361
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,990
His face was on TV, so we were able to identify him as Matsui Tarou.

362
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,480
Namikawa contacted everyone and told them to watch the TV.

363
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,350
Since one of us seven is Kira, Matsui Tarou will soon be dead.

364
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,120
Since one of us seven is Kira, Matsui Tarou will soon be dead.

365
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,730
I see! As Kira, I'm the only one who's realized that "Matsui Tarou" is a fake name!

366
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,000
If I tell them that, they'll know I'm Kira.

367
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,640
Everyone! Soon Kira's identity will become clear! Stay tuned!

368
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,850
Guess you're right. See ya.

369
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,370
Damn it!

370
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,540
Ryuuzaki, Higuchi is calling Mogi-san, who's outside Yoshida Productions.

371
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,660
Yes, here it comes. Just as we planned.

372
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,590
Moji! Where's Misa?!

373
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,300
Ah, Higuchi-sama, thank you so much for doing business with us!

374
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,210
Misa is currently having one of her rare days off, so she has gone out.

375
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,710
She should be back tomorrow morning...

376
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,700
I'm asking you where she went.

377
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,590
I'm sorry, but she said it was private and left without telling anyone.

378
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,640
I'm terribly sorry. I'll be able to contact her tomorrow.

379
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,940
Damn it! I know his face. If only I knew his name, I could...

380
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,090
Her former manager, was he in show business?

381
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,920
Huh?

382
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,650
"Matsui Tarou", remember?!

383
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,960
I replaced him, so I can't really tell you more.

384
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,830
For such inquiries, you should try calling the office.

385
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:04,030
Oh! But they're all presently in Okinawa. Maybe you could try the President?

386
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,420
This is going so precisely as planned, it's almost scary.

387
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,120
Let's not be scared. Just sit back and enjoy this, Yagami-kun.

388
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,460
I'll relay the call between Higuchi and the President of Yoshida Productions.

389
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,370
This is Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group.

390
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,300
That guy who used to work for you, Matsui Tarou, was that his real name?

391
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,490
He's getting more and more direct. Higuchi is such a fool.

392
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:25,760
Ah yes, he was using a stage name when he was a manager, Higuchi-san.

393
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,760
It shows that he's getting desperate.

394
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,930
What's his real name?

395
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,200
I think it's Yamada... no, wait! It's Yamashita.

396
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,570
I think it's Yamada... no, wait! It's Yamashita.

397
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,380
As for his first name... I can't remember.

398
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,490
Don't fuck with me! You should at least know the names of the people you employ!

399
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,000
Hey, there's no need for that kind of talk.

400
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
If you go to the office it should be in the records.

401
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,990
Well, go and tell me.

402
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,300
Gimme a break, we're on the first staff trip we've had in two years!

403
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,830
But if you insist, I'll give you the combination code to access the office.

404
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,670
I don't mind if you go and check it out yourself.

405
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,930
The records are kept in the bottom drawer of the far left hand side desk as you enter.

406
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,060
They're ordered alphabetically. I think it should be Yamashita.

407
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,400
If they're planning on announcing it at the end of the program, I've still got two hours.

408
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,300
I wonder if he'll make a move...

409
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,400
Higuchi's status confirmed.

410
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,050
I'm in pursuit.

411
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,610
Until now, everything has gone exactly as we predicted.

412
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,350
Yes...

413
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,430
I'll kill him... for sure!

414
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,090
After coming this far, I'm not going to be defeated... I'm going to get it all!

415
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,000
After coming this far, I'm not going to be defeated... I'm going to get it all!

416
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,000
To be continued

417
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

418
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
This one page of everlasting depression;

419
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,020
hakanai senpou sono meni

420
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,020
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

421
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,290
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

422
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,290
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

423
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,870
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

424
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,870
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

425
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,520
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

426
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,520
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

427
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,370
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

428
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,370
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

429
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,810
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

430
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,810
Who would know of a path to salvation?

431
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,660
Menzai no waarudo

432
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,660
World of acquittal,

00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,490
seisai no waado

434
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,490
words of retribution!

435
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,230
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

436
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,230
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

437
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,220
Redeem the game of law!

438
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,220
Aganau houritsu geemu

439

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,610
Come, relentless eraser rain.

445
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,570
Zetsubou za birii

446

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,280

Come, relentless eraser rain.

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,910
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,530
relentless eraser rain.

453
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,830
Preview

454
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,400
Now, I'm the greatest!

455
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,370
Damn it. I don't want to use this!

456
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,120
The Chief has been shot!

457
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,420
