WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,020
Makeshift

93
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,730
Well then, let's begin this meeting.

94
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,650
Given that there's only seven of them, one of the eight must have...

95
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,590
Given that there's only seven of them, one of the eight must have...

96
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,600
I suppose they've most likely... killed him.

97
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,730
I suppose they've most likely... killed him.

98
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,760
In order to advance the Yotsuba Group's development further, whom should we kill?

99
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,280
In order to advance the Yotsuba Group's development further, whom should we kill?

100
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,970
See! It's exactly like I said!

101
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,490
See! It's exactly like I said!

102
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,030
This is bad... at this rate...

103
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,120
This is bad... at this rate...

104
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,920
But before that, there are a few things we need to discuss.

105
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,530
Firstly, we need to address Hatori's death.

106
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,170
It was unavoidable.

107
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,050
Besides, if I'm honest, I'm kind of relieved that Hatori is dead.

108
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,280
Kira has clearly shown us what will happen to those who try to leave this group.

109
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,230
I believe everyone here has understood the significance of Hatori's death; let this be a lesson to us all.

110
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,860
Next, Erald Coil's report...

111
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,240
One of their members has died, and that's all they've got to say?!

112
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,520
So, this report is what our $5 million paid for?

113
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,750
He hasn't uncovered any vital information, such as L's face or name.

114
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,810
Is this guy, Coil, really going to be of any use?

115
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,880
Wait.

116
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,470
At the end of the report he warns us not to underestimate L's existence.

117
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,550
"Given your current pace... particularly the fact that the deaths which benefit the Yotsuba Group occur every Friday and Saturday...

118
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,750
"Given your current pace... particularly the fact that the deaths which benefit the Yotsuba Group occur every Friday and Saturday...

119
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,570
it's possible that L will connect this to Kira."

120
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,990
To be able to figure this much out about us, Coil's a pretty capable guy in my book.

121
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,990
At any rate, we need to reconsider our current plan of killing off people towards the end of each week.

122
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,290
T-This is incredible. The confessions just seem to keep on coming.

123
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,870
T-This is incredible. The confessions just seem to keep on coming.

124
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,420
T-This is incredible. The confessions just seem to keep on coming.

125
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,260
Surely, with this recording, we'd be able to arrest all seven of them?

126
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,630
Just as I thought, this is bad...

127
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,950
Kira's not being very versatile with this, huh?

128
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,850
They should at least attempt to spread them out over the course of the week.

129
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,110
I think that since Coil's realized this, it's going to be too risky to carry on killing at our current pace.

130
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,960
From now on, we've got to be more discreet, and ensure that no one else finds out about this.

131
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,730
From now on, we've got to be more discreet, and ensure that no one else finds out about this.

132
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,520
Alright then, moving on to the main issue; whom should we kill?

133
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,000
Alright then, moving on to the main issue; whom should we kill?

134
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,020
The launch of E.L.F. Insurance in Japan... if we don't stop that,

135
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,070
The launch of E.L.F. Insurance in Japan... if we don't stop that,

136
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,810
then the Yotsuba Group, among other companies, will lose a lot of clients.

137
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,050
Agreed.

138
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,840
So, with regards to E.L.F., shall we go with accidental deaths for those on this list?

139
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,970
No objections.

140
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,410
What on earth?! Just like that?!

141
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,850
What on earth?! Just like that?!

142
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,930
Another target is the one who's opposing the Yotsuba Group's plans for a resort.

143
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,960
Another target is the one who's opposing the Yotsuba Group's plans for a resort.

144
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,660
Mr. Zenzai Santorou of the Kugisawa Group.

145
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,690
Zenzai suffers from high blood pressure, so we can specify a date for him to suffer a stroke. How's that?

146
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,790
Zenzai suffers from high blood pressure, so we can specify a date for him to suffer a stroke. How's that?

147
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,990
Zenzai suffers from high blood pressure, so we can specify a date for him to suffer a stroke. How's that?

148
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,200
No objections.

149
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,690
Kira, accidental death, death through illness, specifying exact times...

150
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,510
Kira, accidental death, death through illness, specifying exact times...

151
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,730
Kira, accidental death, death through illness, specifying exact times...

152
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,980
Kira, accidental death, death through illness, specifying exact times...

153
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,330
It's exactly like we thought! There's no mistake about it!

154
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,710
It's exactly like we thought! There's no mistake about it!

155
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,530
No, unfortunately, until said people actually die, we can't say that for sure.

156
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,260
No, unfortunately, until said people actually die, we can't say that for sure.

157
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,840
No, unfortunately, until said people actually die, we can't say that for sure.

158
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,520
From what these seven have disclosed at this meeting,

159
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,960
as long as we closely monitor the actions of those seven until those mentioned at the meeting die...

160
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,750
if we always closely monitor these things from now on... without a doubt, we'll catch Kira.

161
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,520
if we always closely monitor these things from now on... without a doubt, we'll catch Kira.

162
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,020
Ryuuzaki!!

163
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,400
What's up with both of you?

164
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,390
I can't go along with your plan! It's wrong!

165
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,560
I can't go along with your plan! It's wrong!

166
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,660
I knew it...

167
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,720
It's apparent that your plan is to allow those seven to continue killing in order to catch Kira, but I can't do that!

168
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,250
It's apparent that your plan is to allow those seven to continue killing in order to catch Kira, but I can't do that!

169
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,580
He's right! The seven of them are clearly murdering people!

170
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,380
He's right! The seven of them are clearly murdering people!

171
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,050
Surely we can prove this with Matsuda's testimony and these video tapes?!

172
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,050
It's quite a dilemma... if we do arrest them now, everything we've worked for will be ruined.

173
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,050
It's quite a dilemma... if we do arrest them now, everything we've worked for will be ruined.

174
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,470
It's quite a dilemma... if we do arrest them now, everything we've worked for will be ruined.

175
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,490
So, we'll request Kira to kill the E.L.F. people in three weeks' time, and Zenzai this weekend.

176
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,260
So, we'll request Kira to kill the E.L.F. people in three weeks' time, and Zenzai this weekend.

177
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,240
How's that?

178
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,230
No objections.

179
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,440
This weekend?! There's no time left!

180
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,890
Light, do you have the phone numbers for all seven?

181
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,860
Light, do you have the phone numbers for all seven?

182
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,670
Yes.

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,790
It doesn't matter who, we need to contact one of them and force them to call off the murders.

184
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,770
It doesn't matter who, we need to contact one of them and force them to call off the murders.

185
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,920
Wait a minute please. If we do that, it'll mean that they've been discovered just three days after Aiber got in contact with them.

186
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,750
Wait a minute please. If we do that, it'll mean that they've been discovered just three days after Aiber got in contact with them.

187
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,880
Wait a minute please. If we do that, it'll mean that they've been discovered just three days after Aiber got in contact with them.

188
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,250
It'll look suspicious.

189
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,350
Most importantly, it's extremely likely that doing so would make it impossible for us to figure out who Kira is.

190
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,330
Most importantly, it's extremely likely that doing so would make it impossible for us to figure out who Kira is.

191
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,290
After all this work, we'd be back at square one.

192
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,900
In order to catch Kira, we need to be able to prove that they are Kira.

193
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,480
In order to catch Kira, we need to be able to prove that they are Kira.

194
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,310
Ryuuzaki, if Kira really is one of those seven, is it fair to assume that if we call one of them,

195
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,370
Ryuuzaki, if Kira really is one of those seven, is it fair to assume that if we call one of them,

196
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,750
Ryuuzaki, if Kira really is one of those seven, is it fair to assume that if we call one of them,

197
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,620
the chance of them being Kira is one in seven?

198
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,000
I was thinking that there'd be two at most, so I'd say two out of seven.

199
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,090
I was thinking that there'd be two at most, so I'd say two out of seven.

200
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,830
If we're already prepared for them to find out that they're being investigated,

201
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,010
then it's worth betting on the two out of seven.

202
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,640
I'm going to borrow the title "L", Ryuuzaki.

203
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,780
Someone who, from the conversation, looks unlikely to be Kira, yet is still influential... that would be...

204
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,010
Someone who, from the conversation, looks unlikely to be Kira, yet is still influential... that would be...

205
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,660
Namikawa!

206
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,660
Ooi!

207
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,400
If you're going to call, use the phones in this building.

208
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,650
They can't be traced or tapped.

209
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,430
Ideally we would just wipe out all the executives of our rival enterprises, one after the other.

210
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,080
That would be the fastest method, but I guess it doesn't work like that...

211
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,880
Is this the Director of the First Trade Department, Namikawa Reiji-san?

212
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,680
Yes? That's right.

213
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,850
Please give out natural responses while listening to me.

214
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,110
I am L.

215
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,530
Cameras and bugging equipment have been set up in that meeting room.

216
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,310
The entire meeting has been recorded by us.

217
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,710
You began the talks with Hatori's death, and then went on to discuss who you should kill.

218
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,360
You began the talks with Hatori's death, and then went on to discuss who you should kill.

219
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,440
Am I right?

220
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,010
He's seen everything!

221
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:59,640
If you're not Kira or negotiating directly with them, I can make a deal with you.

222
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,830
A deal?!

223
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,910
Postpone the murders of the E.L.F. president, and Zenzai by a month.

224
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,300
I doubt that will prove too difficult for you.

225
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
I see...

226
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,680
And then?

227
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,310
If you do this and cooperate with us from now on, you will...

228
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,290
no, in fact, all except Kira will be considered as attending these meetings under duress, and will not be charged.

229
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,950
no, in fact, all except Kira will be considered as attending these meetings under duress, and will not be charged.

230
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,480
Oh, really...

231
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,140
Now I've got no choice but to side with L.

232
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,150
No, if Kira finds out that I've sided with L, they'll kill me... what should I do?

233
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,950
No, if Kira finds out that I've sided with L, they'll kill me... what should I do?

234
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,120
No, if Kira finds out that I've sided with L, they'll kill me... what should I do?

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,760
If you tell people about this phone call, it'll just cause a panic.

236
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,830
It'll do you no favors, and you'll all be caught.

237
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,240
However, my aim is to go head-to-head with Kira.

238
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,520
However, my aim is to go head-to-head with Kira.

239
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Listen carefully... if L beats Kira, you won't be charged; if Kira beats L, you get to continue your affluent life.

240
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,360
Listen carefully... if L beats Kira, you won't be charged; if Kira beats L, you get to continue your affluent life.

241
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,030
Listen carefully... if L beats Kira, you won't be charged; if Kira beats L, you get to continue your affluent life.

242
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,700
You should just play along with both sides and see what happens.

243
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,480
L or Kira, whoever wins, you can't lose.

244
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,740
The only way for you to lose... is if you're caught right now.

245
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,840
The only way for you to lose... is if you're caught right now.

246
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,350
He's already figured out what my final decision has got to be.

247
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,530
Well then?

248
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,620
Fine, on Monday.

249
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,750
What is it, Namikawa? Who was it?

250
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,360
What is it, Namikawa? Who was it?

251
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,920
One of my men has messed up. I'll have to deal with it on Monday.

252
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,520
Sorry for the interruption. Let's get back on topic.

253
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,240
Sorry for the interruption. Let's get back on topic.

254
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,780
As for when we're going to kill the E.L.F. members and Zenzai...

255
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,070
How about we give Coil a month, and if he still hasn't discovered L's identity by then, we'll kill them off on random dates.

256
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,480
How about we give Coil a month, and if he still hasn't discovered L's identity by then, we'll kill them off on random dates.

257
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,800
How about we give Coil a month, and if he still hasn't discovered L's identity by then, we'll kill them off on random dates.

258
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,860
Then, we'll give him another month, and repeat.

259
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,280
Once L is out of the way, we can resume killing two or three each fortnight.

260
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,160
Basically, our main priority should be to deal with L.

261
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,300
I see. It's true that if we deal with L, we'll have no one left in our way.

262
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,840
I see. It's true that if we deal with L, we'll have no one left in our way.

263
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,790
Until then, we should tread carefully.

264
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,110
That might work.

265
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,330
Well, it can't hurt to play it safe.

266
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,590
In that case, we'll give Coil a month.

267
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,720
No objections!

268
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,290
L should be satisfied with this...

269
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,330
However, we'll continue to meet on a fortnightly basis.

270
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,160
Meeting closed.

271
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,810
It seems to have worked.

272
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,980
Yeah...

273
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,780
Yagami-kun, you really are amazing.

274
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,570
Not only did you manage to postpone the killings, but we might even be able to obtain information from Namikawa.

275
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,530
Not only did you manage to postpone the killings, but we might even be able to obtain information from Namikawa.

276
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,190
Your methods are similar to mine, and you managed to think of this before I did.

277
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,400
Your methods are similar to mine, and you managed to think of this before I did.

278
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,740
In that case...

279
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,510
If I die, you may be able to carry on the name of "L".

280
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,020
If I die, you may be able to carry on the name of "L".

281
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,170
What are you talking about?!

282
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,100
We have a month to deduce who Kira is, and to find the proof.

283
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,560
The challenge begins now.

284
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
Yes...

285
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,830
However, since you were the first to notice the Yotsuba Group, it's fair to say that you may be more capable than I.

286
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,090
However, since you were the first to notice the Yotsuba Group, it's fair to say that you may be more capable than I.

287
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,520
It's possible that you may be able to handle it, Yagami-kun.

288
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,280
If I were to die...

289
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,860
would you succeed me as L?

290
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,070
If I were to die, would you succeed me... with the name of "L"?

291
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,760
If I were to die, would you succeed me... with the name of "L"?

292
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,530
If he's Kira, and is putting on an act, he'll definitely answer "yes".

293
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,280
What are you talking about, Ryuuzaki?

294
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,250
As long as we're wearing these, we'll die together--

295
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,980
Oh, I get it...

296
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,840
Ryuuzaki, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to speak your thoughts aloud to everyone else here.

297
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,730
Ryuuzaki, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to speak your thoughts aloud to everyone else here.

298
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:12,020
Ryuuzaki is thinking that if I were Kira, then either I still am Kira right now and just pretending otherwise,

299
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:17,710
or Kira's power have passed to someone else, and right now I have no recollection of being Kira.

300
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,230
Those are the two patterns.

301
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,390
If it is the former, and I am just acting, then he can never take these handcuffs off.

302
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,660
No, even if I wasn't acting, he probably wouldn't remove the handcuffs.

303
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,390
No, even if I wasn't acting, he probably wouldn't remove the handcuffs.

304
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:37,360
He's thinking that I was Kira, and even though that power may have passed to someone else,

305
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,990
I might have set things up so that the power will return to me.

306
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,390
Basically, it's not that I was simply being manipulated, rather, I may have transferred the power to someone, and have planned to regain it once the suspicions against me had been lifted.

307
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:51,830
Basically, it's not that I was simply being manipulated, rather, I may have transferred the power to someone, and have planned to regain it once the suspicions against me had been lifted.

308
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,720
Amazing... he knew exactly what I was thinking...

309
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,830
Amazing... he knew exactly what I was thinking...

310
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:02,920
Ryuuzaki was thinking that, "after L's position is his, Yagami Light will become Kira".

311
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,800
Correct.

312
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,230
To gain the same status as L and be in a position to even manipulate the police... while secretly being Kira.

313
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,680
To gain the same status as L and be in a position to even manipulate the police... while secretly being Kira.

314
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,640
I would be invincible.

315
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,340
And you think that I'm capable of achieving this... no, in fact you are saying I would do this.

316
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,460
And you think that I'm capable of achieving this... no, in fact you are saying I would do this.

317
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,190
Yes.

318
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,250
But what do you think now?

319
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,160
If nothing else, you must have realized that I'm not acting, right?

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,540
You mean that if you were putting on an act to take my position you wouldn't be revealing your plan to everyone, am I right?

321
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,040
You mean that if you were putting on an act to take my position you wouldn't be revealing your plan to everyone, am I right?

322
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,250
Ryuuzaki...

323
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,990
Do you truly believe that after catching the current Kira, I'd go on to become Kira... A murderer?

324
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,210
Do you truly believe that after catching the current Kira, I'd go on to become Kira... A murderer?

325
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,850
Do you truly believe that after catching the current Kira, I'd go on to become Kira... A murderer?

326
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,010
Do you really see me as that kind of human being?!

327
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,120
I believe so.

328
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,390
I can see it in you.

329
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,750
A-Again...

330
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,620
A-Again...

331
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,440
Okay! An eye for an eye!

332
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,990
Okay! An eye for an eye!

333
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,340
Let's just call this a draw and be done with it!

334
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,030
Yeah, that's right. For now, we've got to catch the Kira that's right in front of us.

335
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,460
Yeah, that's right. For now, we've got to catch the Kira that's right in front of us.

336
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,540
As long as we're wearing these handcuffs, you can't have any complaints.

337
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,550
You're right, we've only got a month left.

338
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,950
Ryuuzaki?

339
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,760
Yes?

340
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:39,860
If we can use the footage of that meeting as evidence to arrest those seven, won't the judging of criminals stop as well?

341
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,940
Again...

342
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,440
Unfortunately...

343
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,380
"Unfortunately"?

344
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,130
...we can't be certain that Kira is among those seven.

345
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,160
If Kira is only connected to them, and we arrest them, then all that will happen is that those seven will be killed.

346
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,860
Unless we know for sure that one of those seven is Kira, there's no point in arresting them...

347
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,130
and even if Kira is among them, it's difficult to say who it is right now.

348
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,260
It's still too early to tell.

349
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,770
B-But if we can't say that Kira is definitely not among those seven,

350
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,000
B-But if we can't say that Kira is definitely not among those seven,

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,640
there's a possibility that if we arrest them, the murders will cease.

352
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,780
It's as my father says. There is that possibility.

353
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,100
It's as my father says. There is that possibility.

354
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,160
Umm, I think I'll chase Kira on my own after all.

355
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,230
Umm, I think I'll chase Kira on my own after all.

356
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,620
I'll let you use these headquarters and I'll continue to use them myself as well.

357
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:36,040
Yagami-san and the rest of you can continue to pursue Kira as you wish, using your own methods.

358
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,370
I'll investigate using my own methods.

359
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,130
Unless we do this, it'll just end in arguments.

360
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,980
Let's just go our separate ways.

361
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,170
In other words, you insist on narrowing it down before you pursue Kira?

362
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,060
Yes.

363
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,590
We can't solve this case unless Kira is caught.

364
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm not saying that there's no point in stopping the deaths of the criminals in front of you,

365
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,750
but unless we expose all truths to the light, Kira will appear again, and consequently, the victims will increase in numbers.

366
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,340
That being the case, it's my belief that we need to confirm Kira's identity through those seven.

367
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,250
That being the case, it's my belief that we need to confirm Kira's identity through those seven.

368
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,500
I'm against the arrest of those seven, so if you're planning to do it, it's your responsibility.

369
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,470
I'm against the arrest of those seven, so if you're planning to do it, it's your responsibility.

370
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,330
I'll pursure Kira by myself.

371
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,920
We have a month. It'll depend on which of us is fastest.

372
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,960
We have a month. It'll depend on which of us is fastest.

373
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,600
Ryuuzaki! Where are you going?

374
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,880
Ryuuzaki! Where are you going?

375
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,340
To Amane's room.

376
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,050
I'm sorry. Light-kun, I know you're on your father's side, but I'll need you to come with me as I can't remove the handcuffs.

377
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,980
I'm sorry. Light-kun, I know you're on your father's side, but I'll need you to come with me as I can't remove the handcuffs.

378
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,770
Light! Is it okay if we go on a date today?

379
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,570
Even if Ryuuzaki-san has got to come...

380
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,360
Misa-san?

381
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,470
Do you love Light-kun?

382
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,870
Y-Yes... very much.

383
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,910
Y-Yes... very much.

384
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,160
And yet, you also admire Kira?

385
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,620
Yes...

386
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,300
So, if you had to choose between them, who would you pick?

387
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,490
Huh?! Light, of course!

388
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,770
Huh?! Light, of course!

389
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,850
It's true that I'm grateful to Kira and I've wanted to meet them in the past, but that isn't love!

390
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,470
It'll definitely have to be Light.

391
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,600
And Light-kun, you want to catch Kira. Don't you, Light-kun?

392
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,160
And Light-kun, you want to catch Kira. Don't you, Light-kun?

393
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,520
Yes, of course.

394
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,520
He wants to catch them. Now, what do you think of that?

395
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,730
He wants to catch them. Now, what do you think of that?

396
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,610
If Light wants to catch them, then I want them caught too.

397
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,410
So, if it was possible, you would want to be of use to Light-kun, and help him investigate, correct?

398
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:34,920
R-Ryuuzaki!

399
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,120
R-Ryuuzaki!

400
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,120
Yeah! Misa would do anything for Light!

401
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,220
Yeah! Misa would do anything for Light!

402
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,120
-_-

403
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,300
Just wait a minute! What are you planning?!

404
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,390
Just wait a minute! What are you planning?!

405
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:50,250
We'll get Erald Coil to report to those seven that he's got a lead that suggests that Amane Misa may know L in some way.

406
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,840
And that "Amane Misa was interrogated on suspicion of being the second Kira".

407
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,470
That's true too.

408
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,680
If they think that there's a chance that Amane Misa knows L,

409
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:07,310
they'll definitely employ her to be in their commercials, and attempt to question her.

410
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,040
That time Matsuda messed up, he did ask for her to be hired for a commercial, after all.

411
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,990
That time Matsuda messed up, he did ask for her to be hired for a commercial, after all.

412
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,510
Yup, yup!

413
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,940
No way.

414
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,070
Why?

415
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,960
Because that would put you in danger, of course.

416
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,250
You're worried about my safety? Yay!

417
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,830
But Misa would do anything for you. This is nothing.

418
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,670
Listen Misa, if they think you know L, they'll try any means possible to get you to admit it.

419
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,050
Listen Misa, if they think you know L, they'll try any means possible to get you to admit it.

420
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,010
Listen Misa, if they think you know L, they'll try any means possible to get you to admit it.

421
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,480
It'll be fine! No matter how much they torture Misa, she won't say a thing!

422
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,930
Yeah, that's right.

423
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,430
We know that Kira can manipulate people before their deaths.

424
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,600
There's a real chance that they'll manipulate Misa into talking before killing her.

425
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,670
In fact, if they kill L, they'll no longer have a use for her, and will kill her in order to silence her.

426
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,890
In fact, if they kill L, they'll no longer have a use for her, and will kill her in order to silence her.

427
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,240
I wouldn't want that...

428
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,650
Light-kun...

429
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,870
as long as we win, Misa-san won't die.

430
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,780
Also, as long as we're connected by these handcuffs, we'll share the same destiny.

431
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,320
Also, as long as we're connected by these handcuffs, we'll share the same destiny.

432
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,460
If I die, you'll die too.

433
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,980
And if that happens, the saddest person will be Misa-san.

434
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,720
Either Light-kun and I die, or we catch Kira.

435
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,630
Either Light-kun and I die, or we catch Kira.

436
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,530
So, which is it?

437
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,640
Catch Kira! I can't live in a world without Light!

438
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,870
That's correct!

439
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,720
Hey, Ryuuzaki! You're going too far!

440
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,240
We don't have time. I'm in a hurry here.

441
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,880
We don't have time. I'm in a hurry here.

442
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:36,010
Besides, Amane Misa's willpower and love for Light-kun are beyond comparisson in this world.

443
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,300
R-Ryuuzaki-san...

444
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,460
R-Ryuuzaki-san...

445
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,780
Misa may have been misjudging you until now!

446
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,690
Calling you a pervert and so on...

447
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,110
But in reality, you actually understand me!

448
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,550
Yeah, Misa-san is an excellent lady, completely worthy of Light-kun.

449
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,530
Yeah, Misa-san is an excellent lady, completely worthy of Light-kun.

450
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,000
Thanks, Ryuuzaki!

451
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,610
I might fall for you...

452
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,610
Erm, I'm not so keen on that... how about we say "we're friends", Ryuuzaki-san?

453
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,890
Yes.

454
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,210
I've made another friend.

455
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,690
Yup! All of Light's friends are Misa's friends too!

456
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,600
Let's all get along!

457
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,320
And Misa never sells out her friends!

458
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,270
The three of us will combine our powers and catch that Kira!

459
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,000
Well actually, Yagami-kun wants to approach the investigation with his father in a different way than I.

460
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,230
Well actually, Yagami-kun wants to approach the investigation with his father in a different way than I.

461
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,000
So, it'll just be the two of us: Misa-san and myself.

462
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,450
Huh?! What's up with that?!

463
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,810
You play pretty dirty, Ryuuzaki... you're giving me no choice but to join this investiga--

464
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,920
You play pretty dirty, Ryuuzaki... you're giving me no choice but to join this investiga--

465
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,870
No. We're fine.

466
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,040
What are you talking about?!

467
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,050
Light's joining too! It's decided!

468
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,340
No, that's not it! I'm against the methods used in this investigation itself. It's too dangerous for Misa.

469
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,000
No, that's not it! I'm against the methods used in this investigation itself. It's too dangerous for Misa.

470
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,740
No, that's not it! I'm against the methods used in this investigation itself. It's too dangerous for Misa.

471
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,810
Light... thank you so much for thinking of me.

472
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,510
Light... thank you so much for thinking of me.

473
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,650
But let me do this. Misa wants to be useful to you, Light.

474
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,110
I want to be able to help you, so that you'll love me even more.

475
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,130
Besides, Misa will quite happily die for you.

476
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,330
As I thought, given the current situation, it'll prove difficult to arrest those seven.

477
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,120
Any good ideas, Mogi? Matsuda?

478
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,950
Any good ideas, Mogi? Matsuda?

479
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,700
Any good ideas, Mogi? Matsuda?

480
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
To be continued

481
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
This one page of everlasting depression;

482
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

483
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,020
hakanai senpou sono meni

484
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,020
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

485
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,290
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

486
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,290
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

487
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,870
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

488
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,870
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

489
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,520
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

490
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,520
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

491
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,370
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

492
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,370
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

493
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,810
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

494
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,810
Who would know of a path to salvation?

495
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,660
World of acquittal,

496
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,660
Menzai no waarudo

497
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,490
words of retribution!

498
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,490
seisai no waado

499
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,230
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

500
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,230
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

501
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,220
Aganau houritsu geemu

502
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,220
Redeem the game of law!

503
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,250
Zetsubou za birii

504
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,250
Despair the Billy,

505
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,990
iza rinri

506
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,990
here are the morals!

507
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,610
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

508
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,610
Come, relentless eraser rain.

509
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,570
Zetsubou za birii

510
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,570
Despair the Billy,

511
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,280
iza rinri

512
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,280
here are the morals!

513
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,910
Come, relentless eraser rain.

514
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,910
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

515
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,530
tomerarenai eraser rain

516
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,530
relentless eraser rain.

517
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,530
Preview

518
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,120
Well, Misa really can act. So...

519
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,440
I'm being asked to act by Director Nishikawa, Light, and now even by Shinigami!

520
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,140
It's all a little hectic!

521
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,350
It seems like I'm about to land a big commercial too.

522
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,410
I sure am popular!

523
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,010
Next Time

524
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,010
