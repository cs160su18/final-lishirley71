1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
WITHIN THE SPREADING DARKNESS.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,360
I EXCHANGED VOWS OF REVOLUTION.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:17,200
BECAUSE I MUSTN'T LET ANYONE INTERFERE WITH ME.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,210
IN THE FUTURE THAT THE FRUIT TOLD ME OF.

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:39,180
DREAMS, TURN INTO IDEALS

6
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:50,480
EVERYONE WISHED FOR AN END...

7
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,240
WITHIN THE SPREADING DARKNESS.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,610
I EXCHANGED VOWS OF REVOLUTION

9
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,790
I MUSTN'T LET ANYONE INTERFERE WITH ME

10
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,870
SOMEDAY, I'LL SHOW YOU

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:16,220
A SHINING WORLD

12
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,030
Shinigami World

13
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,500
What ?

14
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,790
Two death's-heads ?

15
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,960
Hehe, I win again ! Lucky me !

16
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,640
Hey, Ryuk. Wanna play ? Join in once in a while.

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,270
No thanks. I'll pass.

18
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,820
So. I didn't even do anything but he got all pissed.

19
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,070
Really ? Then what ?

20
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,190
Yagami-kun...
Really ? Then what ?

21
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,240
are you listening ?

22
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,530
Will you translate that last part ?

23
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,460
You should follow god's teachings.

24
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,210
If you do, the sea will remain quiet and the storm will not come.

25
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,420
Today at 11a.m...

26
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:04,390
at an apartment complex in Yokoshama in the Karnagawa Prefecture,
a man in his 30's was found dead and covered in blood.

27
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,600
Police have ruled the killing to be a homicide and are...

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,730
Our next story...

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Today in Shibuya, Tokyo.

30
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,250
Naoki Toiuji, age 35, was arrested for suspicion

31
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,530
of murdering his roommate, a 25-year old woman.

32
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,450
Day after day...

33
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,540
The same old thing.

34
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,540
What a waste...

35
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,710
This world is...

36
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,460
Rotten...

37
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,610
Rebirth

38
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,430
You went to see that ?

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,250
What a waste of time. I should get a refund.

40
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,060
"Death Note"... ?

41
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,890
A Notebook of Death ?

42
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,860
"How to Use It...

43
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,650
The human whose name is written in this note shall...

44
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,780
Die."

45
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,990
Ridiculous.

46
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,580
Really, talk about sick.

47
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,710
This is as bad as those chain-letters.

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,920
The person whose name is written dies, my ass.

49
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,060
Sheesh, there must be something wrong with me.

50
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,480
"This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's
face in their mind when writing his or her name.

51
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,530
Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected."

52
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:30,160
"If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds
of writing the person's name, it will happen."

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,620
"If the cause of death is not specified, the
person will simply die of a heart attack."

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,420
"After writing the cause of death, details of the death should
be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds."

55
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,880
Hmm. So you can let people die peacefully,
or make them suffer...

56
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,220
Impressive that someone would put so
much effort into a prank like this...

57
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,480
Write in their name, and they die... ?

58
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,770
Really, how stupid.

59
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,870
Wait a minute.

60
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,500
If someone actually dies, would that make me a murderer ?

61
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,430
Heh, as if it could really happen.

62
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,560
The man who indiscriminately killed and wounded
six people yersteday in Shinjuku...

63
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,730
is still barricaded inside this nursery school
with eight hostages including little children.

64
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,000
The Metropolitan Police have determined the man's identity
as Kurou Otoharada, 42 years old and unemployed.

65
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,030
They are currently trying to negotiate with him.

66
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,040
Forty seconds and it's a heart attack, right ?

67
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,330
...and we don't know that as of yet.

68
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,920
I'm so worried about the hostages.

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,170
Me too.

70
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,550
That's the report from the scene.

71
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,340
Thank you very much.

72
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,860
What are you thoughts, Hashimoto-san ?

73
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,570
I hope the situation is resolved soon.

74
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,430
In the end, nothing happened, I knew it.

75
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,520
What was I expecting ?

76
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,520
Ah, wait a minute !

77
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,400
We have a new development !

78
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,150
The hostages are coming out !

79
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,780
They all seem to be all right.

80
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,870
And noe the police are going in ! Will
they be able to arrest the suspect ?!

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,990
Yes !

82
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
This message just in !

83
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,290
The captor has died inside the nursery school !

84
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,580
It appears the suspect is dead !

85
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,920
Dead ?!

86
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,550
The police are emphasizing that they did not shoot him.

87
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,130
Could that mean he committed suicide ?

88
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,510
Well, the hostages are apparently
saying he suddenly collapsed...

89
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,890
A heart attack...

90
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,850
N-no ! A coincidence !

91
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,980
It has to be !

92
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,690
Light !

93
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,990
It's 6:30pm already.

94
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,200
You have your prep course today, right ?

95
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,740
Uh, yeah. I was just getting ready to go.

96
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,870
Death Note...

97
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,540
If this is real...

98
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,330
I should test it one more time.

99
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,250
So I guess it has to be a criminal after all...

100
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,670
But not anyone too major...

101
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,430
or the cops might keep it secret for a while.

102
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,600
I need the results right away.

103
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,600
Hey. Ryo baby.

104
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,680
Uh... what. Sudou-kun ?

105
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,690
Lend me some money. Two thousand will do.

106
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,810
Eep. Again ?

107
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,770
Sudou.

108
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,270
Try killing him ?

109
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,490
No. I should avoid anybody I actually know...

110
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,160
No, it doesn't even matter.

111
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,330
A guy like that, nobody's even going to care...

112
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,250
Sweet ! We're going to the arcade tonight !

113
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,880
Hey, Maki. Wanna go on a group date tomorrow ?

114
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,210
Yeah, totally !

115
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,880
My mom isn't here yet ?

116
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,260
What's that bitch doing, geez !

117
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,220
Damn...

118
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,220
Start looking around you...

119
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,770
And all you see are people the world
would be better off without.

120
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,940
Onee-san~ !

121
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,780
How 'bout havin' some fun with us tonight ?

122
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,610
Hey Taku-san, you got good taste, man.

123
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,620
My name's Shibuimaru Takuo, that's
Shibutaku for short, heh heh...

124
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,620
(Shibutaku = Cool Taku )

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,500
Come on, Onne-san, how about it ?

126
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,120
I... don't think so...

127
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,500
She doesn't think so, dude !

128
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,960
Aww, so cute !

129
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,360
Let's take off all her clothes !

130
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,950
Hah. You sure ? Hehehe !

131
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,260
Please stop !

132
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,810
STOP !!!

133
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,400
Now...

134
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,440
What will happen ?!

135
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,030
Wait !

136
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,050
Taku, watch out !

137
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,950
This... proves it !

138
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,580
The Death Note is real !

139
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,290
Oh... Taku !

140
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,170
God... damn idiot, what the hell were you thinking ?

141
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,820
'Bout time I got going.

142
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,360
It's been five days.

143
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,400
'Bout time I got going.

144
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,860
Hm ? Where you off to, Ryuk ?

145
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,830
Anyplace you go around here, it's all barren anyway.

146
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,330
I dropped my Death Note.

147
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,420
Whoops ! You really screwed up, man !

148
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,300
Hey, weren't you carrying around a second
one behind the Old Man's back ?

149
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,380
You sayin' you lost both ?

150
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,340
So, you got any idea where you dropped it ?

151
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,220
The Human World.

152
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,140
Ah ?!
Eh ?!

153
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,630
Welcome Home !

154
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,920
You're back early, Light.

155
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,800
Yeah.

156
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm home, mother.

157
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,390
Oh, yeah. The results of the national exam.

158
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,930
Hurry.

159
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,850
Here.

160
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,980
Oh, my !

161
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,440
You placed first again !

162
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,690
Great job, Light !

163
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,360
Well. I'll be studying so don't bother me, okay ?

164
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,610
Sure, dear.

165
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,200
Oh, Light.

166
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,110
Is there anything you've been wanting ?

167
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,740
Anything at all ?

168
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,830
Nothing in perticular. Mom.

169
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,120
I already have what I want.

170
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,100
You seem to be enjoying it.

171
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,820
Why are you so suprised ?

172
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,450
I'm Ryuk, the Shinigami who dropped that notebook.

173
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,910
The way you were acting just now...

174
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,040
I can tell you know it just any old notebook... right ?

175
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,840
Shinigami, huh ?

176
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,510
I'm not surprised to see you, Ryuk.

177
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,350
In fact...

178
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,520
I've been waiting for you... Ryuk.

179
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,310
Oh ?

180
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,690
Not that I doubted that this was a "Death God's notebook",

181
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,320
but seeing things with my own eyes like
this lets me act with greater certainty.

182
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,450
I see.

183
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,740
Gotta say. I'm the one who's surprised.

184
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,120
I've heard of Death Notes reaching down
the human world a few times before...

185
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,670
But this is the first time I have seen someone
do so much in just five days.

186
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,920
Most people would be too scared.

187
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,720
I'm ready for anything, Ryuk...

188
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,430
I used the notebook, knowing it belonged to a Shinigami...

189
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,930
And now the Sinigami's here...

190
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,220
What happens to me now ?

191
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,100
You going take my soul or something ?

192
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,520
Huh ? What's that ?

193
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,270
Some fantasy you humans came up with ?

194
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm not going to do anything to you.

195
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,990
The moment a Death Note lands in the humans world...

196
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,570
that Notebook belongs to the human world.

197
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,160
So it's yours now.

198
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Mine...

199
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:44,090
If you don't want it, give it to another human.

200
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,090
So there really is no to pay for using the Death Note ?

201
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,260
One could say...

202
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,430
the terror and torment that only humans who've
used it, will experience is the price...

203
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,140
And when you die...

204
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,020
I'll be the one writing your name down in my notebook, but...

205
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,530
Don't think that any human who's used the Death Note...

206
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,780
can go to Heaven or to Hell.

207
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,490
That's all.

208
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,870
Something to look forward to when you die.

209
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,750
Light.

210
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,260
It'll be fine. Answer it.

211
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,760
What ?

212
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,850
I brought some apples.

213
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,480
You'll damage your eyes.

214
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
What's going on ?

215
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
She can't see him ?

216
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,440
That originally was my notebook.

217
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,360
Since you've used what was my notebook.

218
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,030
you're the only one who can see me.

219
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,080
Nobody else can hear me either, of course.

220
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,290
You could say that the Death Note...

221
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,250
is the bond between Light the human and Ryuk the Shinigami.

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,880
Yum.

223
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
Okay, one more question.

224
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,550
Why did you choose me ?

225
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,340
Hey, are you listening ?

226
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,230
Wow, human world apples are great.

227
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,810
What do they call this ?

228
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,400
Juicy ?

229
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,060
Answer the question.

230
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,940
Ha, I didn't choose you.

231
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,780
All I did was drop the notebook.

232
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,910
You thought I chose you cause you're so smart or something ?

233
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,030
It just happened to land somewhere around here

234
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,740
An you just happened to pick it up.

235
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,250
That's all.

236
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,290
That's why I wrote the instructions in English,
it's the most popular lamguage in your world.

237
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,420
Then why did you drop it ?

238
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,880
Don't tell me it was by mistake.

239
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,840
after you went wrote all those instructions.

240
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,220
Why you ask ?

241
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,800
Because I was bored, that's why.

242
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,310
Bored ?

243
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,940
THe fact is, Shinigami these days have a lot to do

244
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,650
All they do is nap, or gamble.

245
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,780
If they see you scribbling humans' names
into your Death Note, they say:

246
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,320
"What're you working so hard for ?" and laugh at you.

247
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,620
Writing names of those in the Shinigami realm won't kill them.

248
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,830
And killing people in the human world
while I'm up there isn't any fun at all.

249
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,250
It's more fun to be here, is how I figured it.

250
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,760
Gotta say, though, you really wrote a lot of names in here.

251
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,600
But how come you only specified the cause of death
for the guy who got hit by a truck and nobody else ?

252
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,770
If you don's specify the cause of death,
they all die from a heart attack.

253
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,850
That's the best thing about the Death Note, Ryuk.

254
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,100
Huh ?

255
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,190
I've already covered the most vicious criminals.

256
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,400
So now the level of atrocity is coming down.

257
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,200
So what about that ?

258
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,280
Even a fool is going to notice that somebody
is bumping off the bad guys.

259
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,950
I'm going to make the whole world know of my existence.

260
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,250
That somebody is passing righteous judgment !

261
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:16,420
But I was wondering why you would go through all that trouble ?

262
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,800
I... was also bored...

263
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,850
Of course. I didn't believe it at first.

264
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,690
But that notebook has a power...

265
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,520
that makes anybody want to try using it, at least once.

266
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,150
I... I've killed...

267
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,120
I've... killed... two people...

268
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,870
It's life...

269
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,700
It can't be so easy

270
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,420
Do I have the right to punish others... ?

271
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,380
No, wait...

272
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,960
This is waht I've been thinking all along...

273
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,510
This world is a rotten mess.

274
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,550
Those who are rotten should die !

275
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,510
Somebody...

276
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,180
Somebody, has to do it !

277
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,480
Even if it costs them their mind and soul !

278
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,860
This world needs to be cleansed !

279
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,980
Suppose someone else picked up this notebook...

280
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,950
could they get rid of the useless people of this world ?

281
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,610
Of course not !

282
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,370
But I can...

283
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,290
I can do it !

284
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,540
No, I'm the only one who could do it !

285
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,830
I'll use the Death Note...

286
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,380
to change the world !!

287
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,130
First, to cleanse the world

288
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,210
I wrote down the names of all the major criminals.

289
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,970
Soon, nobody will commit crimes anymore.

290
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,680
And, while people who obviously deserve to
be punished are dying of heart attacks...

291
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:33,440
I'll gradually be killing off immoral people, and people
who harass others, through illness and accidents.

292
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,610
Then the world will start to become a better place.

293
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,620
And I'll make this a world inhabited by
only the people I acknowledge as good !

294
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,790
But then you'll be the only bastard left...

295
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,250
What are you talking about, Ryuk ?

296
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,250
I'm a serious, straight-A student...

297
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,510
And I..

298
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,430
...will be the God of the new world !

299
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,850
I was right, humans are...

300
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,520
interesting !

301
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,070
To be continued...

302
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,600
I had a dream that no one else could have

303
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,850
and I threw away everything that I didn't need

304
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:44,490
Thoughts that I can't surrender dwel in my chest

305
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:51,040
Even if I'm still in the rift between reality and ideals

306
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,120
and my feet are bound by shacles of sacrifice

307
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,380
My overflowing impulses aren't fully repressed

308
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:09,180
Because I have a heart that yearns powerfully

309
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,060
"Lies" "Fear" "Facade" "Grief"

310
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,440
I won't be weak enough

311
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,780
To be apprehended by the various negative things

312
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,700
I'm a trickster who doesn't know loneliness

313
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,910
Preview

314
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,210
The whole world is watching...

315
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,710
to see what happens when you defy me...

316
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,680
