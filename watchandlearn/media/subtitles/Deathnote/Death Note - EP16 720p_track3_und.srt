00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,020
Decisions

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,860
I relinquish all ownership of this notebook.

18
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,750
I'm counting on you... take care of Misa.

19
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,240
I'm counting on you... take care of Misa.

20
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,180
Stalker-san?

21
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,580
Hey, Stalker-san? Where are you?

22
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,390
Why don't you stop playing games now?

23
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,080
Stalker? What's she talking about?

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,190
Stalker? What's she talking about?

25
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,570
She's suddenly undergone a complete change in attitude...

26
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,880
Just as I thought, as long as I have Ryuk's Death Note, even if I discard Rem's Death Note, I won't forget about Rem.

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,990
Just as I thought, as long as I have Ryuk's Death Note, even if I discard Rem's Death Note, I won't forget about Rem.

28
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,610
Just as I thought, as long as I have Ryuk's Death Note, even if I discard Rem's Death Note, I won't forget about Rem.

29
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,660
Just as I thought, as long as I have Ryuk's Death Note, even if I discard Rem's Death Note, I won't forget about Rem.

30
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,050
But still, Rem... it's thanks to you bringing another Death Note into the human world that I've ended up in this...

31
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,050
But still, Rem... it's thanks to you bringing another Death Note into the human world that I've ended up in this...

32
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,790
You really sure about this, Light?

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,880
Yeah.

34
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,480
You know, I never guessed the notebook I gave you would end up discarded in the ground somewhere.

35
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,980
You know, I never guessed the notebook I gave you would end up discarded in the ground somewhere.

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,860
Listen Ryuk... for the moment, I've only hidden it in the ground.

37
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,760
Listen Ryuk... for the moment, I've only hidden it in the ground.

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,540
I will discard it... the very next time the word "discard" escapes my mouth.

39
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,360
I will discard it... the very next time the word "discard" escapes my mouth.

40
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,250
Regardless of the context in which I say it, when I say that word, I'll mean it in relation to discarding the notebook.

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,360
Got it.

42
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,210
Stalker-san? This is a felony, you know, please stop...

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,790
Stalker-san? Hey?

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,490
Stalker-san? Hey?

45
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,590
She's been like this ever since she passed out...

46
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,590
Jeez, she really thinks she can feign innocence, doesn't she?

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,390
Ah, I know!

48
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,490
For now, why don't you just take off my blindfold?

49
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,510
Stalker-san, I really want to see your face.

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,980
Matsuda-san, call Mogi-san.

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,320
Here.

52
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,240
Mogi-san, when you arrested Amane Misa, you said it was on suspicion of being the second Kira, didn't you?

53
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,780
Yes, exactly as you said.

54
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,460
We covered up her eyes and mouth from behind, and said clearly, so she could hear, "we're arresting you on suspicion of being the second Kira".

55
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,020
She didn't attempt to resist the handcuffs or the blindfold. She seemed pretty resigned.

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,570
I'll give you my autograph and shake your hand.

57
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,090
Oh, I know! I'll kiss you on the cheek!

58
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,430
Hey, Misa won't run away!

59
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,860
We've been discussing the second Kira for a while already... why has she started talking about a stalker now?

60
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,030
We've been discussing the second Kira for a while already... why has she started talking about a stalker now?

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,240
Amane Misa.

62
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,710
Stalker-san, what do you want?

63
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,650
Have you finally decided to release me?

64
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,820
Before you fell asleep, you were denying everything, and even went as far as saying "kill me", yet, now we have a senseless struggle like this?

65
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,440
What are you talking about?

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,210
Stalker-san, you were the one who knocked out and brought Misa here.

67
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,210
What? You want to do an "Investigation of Amane Misa" or something?

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Do you know why you're tied up like that?

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,230
Why? It's because Misa's an idol, right?

70
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,220
Why? It's because Misa's an idol, right?

71
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,560
But you know, Stalker-san, you're the first to have gone this far for me...

72
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,520
Damn it, Amane!

73
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,140
Stop messing around!

74
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,440
I-I'm scared... what's going on?!

75
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,090
I don't want this!

76
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,250
Let me go! Let me go!

77
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,570
Let me go! Let me go!

78
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,110
Umm... that's right. I have to go to the bathroom again.

79
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,110
Bathroom! I want to go!

80
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,180
You went to the bathroom only four minutes ago.

81
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,450
Please try to hold it.

82
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,030
What?! If I didn't say, I'd have to go here!

83
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,560
You'll get to see Misa wet herself again, won't that be fun?!

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,750
You pervert!

85
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,780
I'm... a pervert?

86
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm... a pervert?

87
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,080
Amane, let's be serious and continue our discussion from before you fell asleep.

88
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,060
Amane, let's be serious and continue our discussion from before you fell asleep.

89
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,000
Do you know Yagami Light?

90
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,890
How did you get to know him?

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,150
Why wouldn't I know my own boyfriend?!

92
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,180
Before, she didn't confess a thing, yet now she's openly calling him her boyfriend?

93
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,340
Before, she didn't confess a thing, yet now she's openly calling him her boyfriend?

94
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,860
What's going on?

95
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,950
It's Light-kun.

96
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,990
Turn off the video and audio.

97
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,330
Understood.

98
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,520
Yes?

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,090
Yes, I understand.

100
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,790
I'm in room 2801 at the K.

101
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,790
K is the abbreviated name of the hotel.

102
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,250
My son is coming here?

103
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,470
Ryuuzaki, it's as I said on the phone...

104
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,890
Ryuuzaki, it's as I said on the phone...

105
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,570
I... might be Kira.

106
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,110
I... might be Kira.

107
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,070
D-Don't be stupid! What are you saying?! Light?!

108
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,160
D-Don't be stupid! What are you saying?! Light?!

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,270
D-Don't be stupid! What are you saying?! Light?!

110
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,820
D-Don't be stupid! What are you saying?! Light?!

111
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,980
What's happened?! Huh?!

112
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,620
What's happened?! Huh?!

113
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,050
I have no proof that Yagami Light is Kira.

114
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,110
Yet, you're saying "I might be Kira"... it's an act.

115
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,510
Yet, you're saying "I might be Kira"... it's an act.

116
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,100
It's not that you "might be" Kira, you are Kira.

117
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,520
It's not that you "might be" Kira, you are Kira.

118
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,670
What on earth are you trying to do?

119
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,210
Father, if Ryuuzaki is L, it's not an exaggeration to say that he's the best detective in the world.

120
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,520
Father, if Ryuuzaki is L, it's not an exaggeration to say that he's the best detective in the world.

121
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,300
Father, if Ryuuzaki is L, it's not an exaggeration to say that he's the best detective in the world.

122
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,570
That same L is labeling me as Kira. I have to be Kira.

123
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,770
That same L is labeling me as Kira. I have to be Kira.

124
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,240
W-What are you saying?! Light?!

125
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,850
W-What are you saying?! Light?!

126
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,640
W-What are you saying?! Light?!

127
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,570
The person who the FBI investigator Ray Penber was investigating from the time he came to Japan until he died...

128
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,030
The person who was in Aoyama on the 22nd of May...

129
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,410
The person who Amane Misa, the suspected second Kira, immediately made advances on after coming here from Kanto...

130
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,790
they're all me.

131
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,200
If I were in L's shoes, I'd deduce that I was Kira.

132
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,330
If I were in L's shoes, I'd deduce that I was Kira.

133
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:29,040
This means that subconsciously, I might have become Kira.

134
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,380
Light...

135
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,300
I see... subconsciously, huh?

136
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,180
I see... subconsciously, huh?

137
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,580
I don't even understand myself anymore.

138
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Even though I'm not conscious of it, I could be killing people while I sleep or something!

139
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,730
Even though I'm not conscious of it, I could be killing people while I sleep or something!

140
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,980
That you haven't.

141
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,820
What do you mean, Ryuuzaki?!

142
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:55,570
To be honest, there was a period of five days where we set up surveillance cameras in your room.

143
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,330
Cameras?

144
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,690
Yes.

145
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,750
You slept normally at night.

146
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,090
Having seen that criminals continued to die, despite you having no access to information about them,

147
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,130
I concluded not that you were innocent; merely that, if you were Kira, you would not give yourself away on camera.

148
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,300
I concluded not that you were innocent; merely that, if you were Kira, you would not give yourself away on camera.

149
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,490
"If you were Kira, you wouldn't give yourself away", huh?

150
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,010
That could be true.

151
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,260
If I'm honest, I've sometimes thought that some criminals would be better off dead.

152
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,000
If I'm honest, I've sometimes thought that some criminals would be better off dead.

153
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,000
I think anyone who thinks this way could become Kira.

154
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,810
Light-kun! I'm exactly the same.

155
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,570
Light-kun! I'm exactly the same.

156
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,700
I often find myself thinking that certain people would be better off dead, but that doesn't mean we would really go and kill them, right?

157
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,640
I often find myself thinking that certain people would be better off dead, but that doesn't mean we would really go and kill them, right?

158
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,730
Besides, criminals that you had no knowledge of continued to die.

159
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,540
The surveillance cameras proved this!

160
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,560
N-No... at the time, we didn't have enough manpower, and only watched his movements inside of the house.

161
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,670
N-No... at the time, we didn't have enough manpower, and only watched his movements inside of the house.

162
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,290
N-No... at the time, we didn't have enough manpower, and only watched his movements inside of the house.

163
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,690
It's not like we watched him 24/7 over those five days, so he may have had a way of killing people when he was out of the house.

164
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,270
It's not like we watched him 24/7 over those five days, so he may have had a way of killing people when he was out of the house.

165
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,210
Did you predict that things would turn out this way, Yagami Light?

166
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,130
But, if we detain him like Amane, and criminals continue to die... that would make Yagami Light not Kira, right?

167
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,180
But, if we detain him like Amane, and criminals continue to die... that would make Yagami Light not Kira, right?

168
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,280
But, if we detain him like Amane, and criminals continue to die... that would make Yagami Light not Kira, right?

169
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,630
But, if we detain him like Amane, and criminals continue to die... that would make Yagami Light not Kira, right?

170
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,400
Is that your plan?

171
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,750
Somehow I don't like the way this conversation is heading, but...

172
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,600
Fine.

173
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,350
We'll restrain Yagami Light, and imprison him long term.

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:45,970
W-What?!

175
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,950
W-What?!

176
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,650
Light-kun... imprisoned?

177
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,650
Light-kun... imprisoned?

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,270
If we're going to do this, we'll start now, by making sure he never goes anywhere I can't see him.

179
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,700
If we're going to do this, we'll start now, by making sure he never goes anywhere I can't see him.

180
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,260
T-This is stupid! There's no way my son could be Kira!

181
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,420
T-This is stupid! There's no way my son could be Kira!

182
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,620
T-This is stupid! There's no way my son could be Kira!

183
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,690
My son would never--!

184
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,320
It's okay, father.

185
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,950
Light?!

186
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:12,440
I can't continue chasing Kira, when deep down, I don't even know whether I'm Kira or not.

187
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,230
In return, until you have absolutely no doubt about whether I'm innocent or Kira, no matter what happens or what I say, don't let me out.

188
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:23,680
In return, until you have absolutely no doubt about whether I'm innocent or Kira, no matter what happens or what I say, don't let me out.

189
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,830
I understand.

190
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,800
Yagami-san, can you come up with an excuse for Light-kun's absence for your family?

191
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,970
Yagami-san, can you come up with an excuse for Light-kun's absence for your family?

192
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,940
I mean... please do so.

193
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,030
A-All of a sudden, you can't expect me to--!

194
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,800
A-All of a sudden, you can't expect me to--!

195
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,710
In the first place, I can't understand why my son has to be imprisoned!

196
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,380
You're being stubborn, father.

197
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,240
This is the only method by which I'll be able to convince myself.

198
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,240
Are you serious, Light?

199
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,510
Yes.

200
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,500
By sealing away my freedom, I'm going to win against the fear that Kira lurks inside me!

201
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,000
Aizawa-san, I'm counting on you.

202
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,530
Okay.

203
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,910
Imprisonment: Day One

204
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,490
Now all that remains is to discard the notebook.

205
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,720
I'm gonna be stuck with no apples to eat again?

206
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,340
Ryuuzaki, I want you to remove me from the investigation.

207
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,100
Ryuuzaki, I want you to remove me from the investigation.

208
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,090
Chief!

209
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,490
The one currently imprisoned under suspicion of being Kira is my own son.

210
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,690
I have no right to be here.

211
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:04,000
Even when we were discussing his imprisonment, I tried to prevent it due to my own personal feelings.

212
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,030
That's right.

213
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,430
You shouldn't let your personal feelings get involved.

214
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,510
I-If it turns out that my son is Kira, I don't know what I'd do.

215
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:16,500
I-If it turns out that my son is Kira, I don't know what I'd do.

216
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,360
Yes... it's not unimaginable that you may think to kill your son and then yourself.

217
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,220
Yes... it's not unimaginable that you may think to kill your son and then yourself.

218
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,630
I agree, it's better that you aren't here.

219
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,570
Ryuuzaki, I'd like you to imprison me as well.

220
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,520
Ryuuzaki, I'd like you to imprison me as well.

221
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,520
Right now, I'm calm.

222
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,570
But I have no idea what I might do, due to feelings for my son.

223
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,710
I thought that you might say something like this, so I've asked Watari to make the necessary arrangements.

224
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,860
I thought that you might say something like this, so I've asked Watari to make the necessary arrangements.

225
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,110
But, though you will be imprisoned, you will have your cell phone turned on, now and again as usual, and will continue to communicate with your family and the outside world.

226
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,360
But, though you will be imprisoned, you will have your cell phone turned on, now and again as usual, and will continue to communicate with your family and the outside world.

227
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,880
But, though you will be imprisoned, you will have your cell phone turned on, now and again as usual, and will continue to communicate with your family and the outside world.

228
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,330
Light-kun won't be informed of this, and if he talks to you, we need him to think that you're still part of this investigation.

229
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,340
Light-kun won't be informed of this, and if he talks to you, we need him to think that you're still part of this investigation.

230
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,970
Light-kun won't be informed of this, and if he talks to you, we need him to think that you're still part of this investigation.

231
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,500
Even while you are imprisoned, you will be kept up to date with the investigation at all times.

232
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,770
Even while you are imprisoned, you will be kept up to date with the investigation at all times.

233
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,350
Is that fine with you?

234
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,320
I owe you one, Ryuuzaki.

235
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,320
Imprisonment: Day Three

236
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,910
Stalker-san, I want to take a bath.

237
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,820
Stalker-san, I want to take a bath.

238
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm guessing you know where I live anyway... fetch me a change of clothes...

239
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,990
Things are getting super crazy around here again...

240
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,990
I just feel really bad for the Chief.

241
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,690
Ryuuzaki, how is it going?

242
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,430
Were there any reports of new criminals that were likely to be targeted by Kira yesterday or the day before?

243
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,180
And if they were reported, have they been killed by Kira?

244
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,100
There have been reports of some likely criminals, but ever since you were imprisoned, not a single criminal has been killed.

245
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,760
There have been reports of some likely criminals, but ever since you were imprisoned, not a single criminal has been killed.

246
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,020
They've stopped being killed?

247
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,230
Really?

248
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,200
Yes.

249
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,510
I see... looks like they're finally going to decide that I'm Kira.

250
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,270
I see... looks like they're finally going to decide that I'm Kira.

251
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,160
I really want to eat an apple...

252
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,220
What's going on?

253
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,370
I thought that even if I imprisoned Yagami Light, the killings would continue.

254
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,000
Yet, they've completely stopped.

255
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,940
It looked as though he was voluntarily offering to imprison himself, but the way this is going, he'll end up as Kira.

256
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,890
It looked as though he was voluntarily offering to imprison himself, but the way this is going, he'll end up as Kira.

257
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,670
It looked as though he was voluntarily offering to imprison himself, but the way this is going, he'll end up as Kira.

258
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,820
Now the question remains, whether or not he was conscious of being Kira.

259
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,500
Now the question remains, whether or not he was conscious of being Kira.

260
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,310
Even if he is Kira, does he think that pretending to be unaware of it will make it alright?

261
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,190
Even if he is Kira, does he think that pretending to be unaware of it will make it alright?

262
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,780
This isn't like Yagami Light... no, it isn't like Kira.

263
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,090
This isn't like Yagami Light... no, it isn't like Kira.

264
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,400
This isn't like Yagami Light... no, it isn't like Kira.

265
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,120
Imprisonment: Day Five

266
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,340
It's no good, Light.

267
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,920
If I don't eat an apple soon--!

268
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,630
In any case, the only thing to do is to be patient... even if there's nothing to do.

269
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,680
Stalker-san... you won't be able to sell a video of me just sitting down.

270
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,090
Yagami-san seems to be in a much worse condition than Light-kun or Amane.

271
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,150
Well, of course!

272
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:25,540
During the five days Light-kun has been imprisoned, not a single reported criminal has died.

273
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,560
In this kind of situation, it's harder on the parent than the suspect.

274
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,090
As a result, this has pretty much decided that Light-kun is Kira.

275
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,870
Yagami-san...

276
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,990
What is it?!

277
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,080
Is it good or bad news?!

278
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,330
...umm, no. I think it would be better if you don't think too much about this.

279
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,590
...umm, no. I think it would be better if you don't think too much about this.

280
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,910
No matter what you're thinking as you sit there, it won't affect the end results.

281
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,440
Why don't you rest in a more relaxing environment?

282
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,780
Don't be ridiculous!

283
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,530
There is no such thing as a relaxing environment in my current circumstances!

284
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,810
This is the most relaxing place for me now.

285
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,980
No matter what the result is, when I leave here, it will be with my son!

286
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,290
I understand.

287
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,660
Imprisonment: Day Seven

288
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,300
Light-kun, it's only been a week, but you look exhausted.

289
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,130
Light-kun, it's only been a week, but you look exhausted.

290
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,930
Are you okay?

291
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,610
It's probably about time... now that I've gotten this far...

292
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,980
It's probably about time... now that I've gotten this far...

293
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:42,850
Yeah.

294
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,890
Even I can't say that I look too good at the moment... but such meaningless pride... I'll discard it!

295
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,490
Even I can't say that I look too good at the moment... but such meaningless pride... I'll discard it!

296
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,310
Even I can't say that I look too good at the moment... but such meaningless pride... I'll discard it!

297
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,250
Alright.

298
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,430
Gotcha!

299
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,220
See ya.

300
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,520
Huh? Why am I doing this?

301
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,700
Ryuuzaki!

302
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:40,370
I know I chose to be imprisoned and go through with this, but I've just realized, there's no point in this!

303
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,950
Because I am not Kira.

304
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,840
Hurry up and let me out of here!

305
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,770
I can't do that.

306
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,420
Until I'm sure whether you're Kira or not, no matter what you say, I won't release you. That was the promise.

307
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,370
There was something wrong with me that time!

308
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,710
Do you actually believe that it's possible to do what Kira does and not be aware of it?!

309
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,230
I am not conscious of being Kira, therefore I am not Kira!

310
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,110
I also believe that Kira cannot be unaware of who they are, but if you are Kira, then it all adds up.

311
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,840
I also believe that Kira cannot be unaware of who they are, but if you are Kira, then it all adds up.

312
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,430
As soon as we imprisoned you, the killings stopped.

313
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,240
Listen carefully, Ryuuzaki, there's no way I'm lying.

314
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm not Kira!

315
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,400
I can only imagine that I've been set up!

316
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,370
What's going on, Yagami Light?

317
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,960
What you're saying is all over the place... but why do I sense I'm getting close to the root of the problem?

318
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,830
Hurry up and let me out!

319
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,960
This is a waste of time!

320
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,530
No. I can't let you out.

321
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,170
Damn it! How did it turn out like this...

322
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,020
Damn it! How did it turn out like this...

323
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,610
What's going on? This isn't like Light-kun.

324
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,200
He's contradicting himself and isn't being logical at all.

325
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,950
Now that the murdering of criminals has stopped, there's no way we can release him.

326
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,960
Even I have realized that much.

327
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,470
Well, no matter what anyone says, at this rate, Yagami Light will be confirmed as Kira. We can close the case, and everyone will be happy.

328
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,010
Well, no matter what anyone says, at this rate, Yagami Light will be confirmed as Kira. We can close the case, and everyone will be happy.

329
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,840
Imprisonment: Day Fifteen

330
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,720
What's going on?!

331
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,500
Two weeks' worth of criminals were taken out in one shot yesterday!

332
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,670
Yeah... Kira is back.

333
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,140
Kira Returns

334
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,920
Yeah... Kira is back.

335
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,800
Have you told the Chief?

336
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,460
No, not yet.

337
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,160
Chief! Kira is on the move!

338
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,420
Chief! Kira is on the move!

339
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,520
What?!

340
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,870
Kira was just resting.

341
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,370
The judgment of criminals has begun again!

342
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:38,960
I-Is this true, Matsuda?!

343
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,450
I-Is this true, Matsuda?!

344
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,520
S-So my son... I can't say I'm happy that the killings have started again, but this means that the suspicions surrounding my son...

345
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,660
S-So my son... I can't say I'm happy that the killings have started again, but this means that the suspicions surrounding my son...

346
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:49,090
S-So my son... I can't say I'm happy that the killings have started again, but this means that the suspicions surrounding my son...

347
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,580
no, I know Ryuuzaki won't say he's completely "white"...

348
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,160
Let's go with "grey" then.

349
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,320
Hear that Chief?!

350
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,180
Yeah.

351
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,020
So, he was mainly "black" before...

352
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,070
Thank goodness.

353
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,060
I'm sure that it's a "grey" that's nearly indistinguishable from "white".

354
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,430
Next, we should tell Light-kun--

355
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,130
Matsuda!!

356
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,280
I mean, Matsuda-san, please stop.

357
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,690
"Matsuda"?

358
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Please don't tell Light-kun.

359
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,360
W-Why?

360
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,340
W-Why?

361
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,650
Light-kun...

362
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,530
What is it, Ryuuzaki?

363
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,160
No criminals have been judged for over the past two weeks now.

364
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,990
Why don't you just admit that you are Kira?

365
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,080
You're being stupid, Ryuuzaki.

366
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,430
You're wrong.

367
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,140
I'm not surprised that you think I'm Kira from the way the investigation has been going, but this is a trap!

368
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,110
I'm not Kira!

369
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,720
Use the zoom or whatever to look closely at my eyes!

370
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,460
Are these the eyes of someone who's lying?!

371
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,150
Amane, are you sure you don't know who Kira is?

372
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,720
Amane, are you sure you don't know who Kira is?

373
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,130
This, again?

374
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,900
Misa would like to know that herself.

375
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,740
Kira is a superhero that killed the criminal who murdered Misa's parents.

376
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,240
I have no idea what's going on...

377
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

378
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,370
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

379
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,370
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

380
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,500
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

381
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,500
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

382
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:39,280
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

383
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:39,280
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

384
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:46,060
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

385
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:46,060
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

386
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,130
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

387
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,130
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

388
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,270
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

389
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,270
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

390
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:03,920
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

391
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:03,920
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

392
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,080
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

393
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,080
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

394
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,560
Samazama na negative ni

395
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm not so weak,

396
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,890
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

397
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,890
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

398
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,750
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

399
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,750
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

400
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,410
Preview

401
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,150
N-No way!

402
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,880
N-No way!

403
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,580
Wait, father!

404
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,120
If we die now, we'll never know the truth!

405
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,830
If we die now, we'll never know the truth!

406
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,340
Are you going to believe L over me?

407
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,090
Father!

408
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,800
Next Time

409
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,800
Execution
