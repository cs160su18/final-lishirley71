00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

16
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,100
Charge

17
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,750
Next, about Misora Naomi, isn't it about time that we open up the investigation to the public?

18
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,750
Next, about Misora Naomi, isn't it about time that we open up the investigation to the public?

19
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,390
Next, about Misora Naomi, isn't it about time that we open up the investigation to the public?

20
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,160
If we do, we should try to avoid any connections being made to the Kira case.

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,000
Use an artist's impression rather than a photo.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,850
But, it's already been four months since she vanished.

23
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,230
But, it's already been four months since she vanished.

24
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,740
I can only imagine that she's dead.

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,030
Even if she's dead, it's strange that no one has been able to locate her body yet.

26
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,120
If we can find it, it may shed some light on this situation.

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,280
Ryuuzaki.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,990
Sakura TV.

29
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,600
Something terrible is occurring.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,170
Basically, we're presenting this broadcast as Kira's hostages, but also as reporters fulfilling their duties.

31
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,950
Basically, we're presenting this broadcast as Kira's hostages, but also as reporters fulfilling their duties.

32
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,170
Please understand that we would never air this broadcast with an intent to deceive or with a wish to gain popularity.

33
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,810
Kira's hostages?

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,570
What's going on?

35
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,200
Four days ago, the director on duty received these four tapes.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,740
Four days ago, the director on duty received these four tapes.

37
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,220
Without a doubt, they have been sent by Kira.

38
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,180
Our ratings will rise by 60%... no, 70% at least!

39
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,260
Our ratings will rise by 60%... no, 70% at least!

40
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:43,450
The first tape contained predictions of the date and times of death for two suspects that were recently apprehended.

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,810
Yesterday both suspects died at exactly their predicted times of death.

42
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,590
If that is really true, it's definitely something only Kira can do.

43
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,150
If that is really true, it's definitely something only Kira can do.

44
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:02,240
We've received orders from Kira to play this second tape today at exactly 5:59pm.

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,640
We've been informed that this will contain a predicted murder as further proof that they are Kira, and also a message to the people of the world.

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,610
We've been informed that this will contain a predicted murder as further proof that they are Kira, and also a message to the people of the world.

47
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:11,910
A-Are you sure that this isn't another joke?

48
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,780
A-Are you sure that this isn't another joke?

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,000
Surely... no one would pull a prank that's this sick.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,160
Surely... no one would pull a prank that's this sick.

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,220
Here it is.

52
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,300
I am Kira.

53
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:38,080
If this video is being broadcast at exactly 5:59pm on the 18th of April, it should now be 5:59pm and 47... 48... 49...

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,150
If this video is being broadcast at exactly 5:59pm on the 18th of April, it should now be 5:59pm and 47... 48... 49...

55
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,530
If this video is being broadcast at exactly 5:59pm on the 18th of April, it should now be 5:59pm and 47... 48... 49...

56
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,260
Please change the channel to Taiyou TV now.

57
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,850
The main newsreader, Hibima Kazuhiko, will die of a heart attack at exactly 6 o'clock.

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,830
The main newsreader, Hibima Kazuhiko, will die of a heart attack at exactly 6 o'clock.

59
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,660
Change it.

60
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,010
No way...

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,650
You okay?!

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,030
Stop filming!

63
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,900
I said turn it off!

64
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,010
Get help!!

65
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,850
How dare they...

66
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,810
Change the channel back.

67
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,150
Hibima Kazuhiko continued to air his claims that Kira is evil.

68
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,090
Also, bring me another TV. No, make that two.

69
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,150
Also, bring me another TV. No, make that two.

70
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,390
This is his due.

71
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,390
Yes.

72
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,850
Another sacrifice will have to be made.

73
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,640
The target will be someone currently live on NHN TV.

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,290
A commentator who's been negative about me, Kobaizumi Seiji.

75
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,730
A commentator who's been negative about me, Kobaizumi Seiji.

76
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,240
Ryuuzaki!

77
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,690
Turn to channel 24.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,450
Huh?! Pull yourself together!

79
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,450
Please change it back.

80
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,740
I think that, by now, you should all believe that I am Kira.

81
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,850
Kira said that they wanted to send a message to the world, but...

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,370
We've got to stop this broadcast, or there will be trouble!

83
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,590
I'll phone Sakura TV!

84
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,620
No good, my acquaintance at the station has his phone switched off.

85
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,600
No good, my acquaintance at the station has his phone switched off.

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,750
No matter what part of the station I ring it's all busy!

87
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,560
Screw this...

88
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,150
Ukita-san!

89
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,770
I'll go to the station in person and make them stop!

90
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,940
Everyone, listen carefully, I don't want to have to kill innocent people.

91
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,220
Everyone, listen carefully, I don't want to have to kill innocent people.

92
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,550
I hate evil, and love justice.

93
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,940
I hate evil, and love justice.

94
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,660
I even regard the police as my ally, and not as my enemy.

95
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,490
Damn you, Kira...

96
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,550
My wish is to create a world without any evil.

97
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,420
If you all decide similarly, it should be easy to achieve.

98
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,750
If you all decide similarly, it should be easy to achieve.

99
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,720
If you cease your attempts to capture me, no innocent people will die.

100
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,920
If you cease your attempts to capture me, no innocent people will die.

101
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,470
Damn...

102
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,040
Even if you don't agree with me, as long as you don't go to the media, or express it publicly, I won't kill you.

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,200
Even if you don't agree with me, as long as you don't go to the media, or express it publicly, I won't kill you.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,360
Even if you don't agree with me, as long as you don't go to the media, or express it publicly, I won't kill you.

105
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,700
Please try and wait a while; this world will become something that anyone would appreciate.

106
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,640
Please try and wait a while; this world will become something that anyone would appreciate.

107
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,640
I will change this filthy world into a world that's build for gentle people.

108
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,950
Try to imagine this.

109
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,830
The police and I will creat--

110
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,660
Sachiko...

111
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,960
Darling, this is bad for your health. Please try to get some rest.

112
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,000
Darling, this is bad for your health. Please try to get some rest.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,300
Darling, this is bad for your health. Please try to get some rest.

114
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,360
Sachiko... I'm the Chief of the Kira Special Investigation Unit.

115
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,810
Sachiko... I'm the Chief of the Kira Special Investigation Unit.

116
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,130
Shit! It's shut!

117
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,480
Police! Open up!

118
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,410
Police! Open up!

119
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,870
Idiots!!

120
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,540
We interrupt this program to bring you live footage from outside the Sakura TV station!

121
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,580
Hello? Damn it! I can't get through.

122
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,600
Hello? Damn it! I can't get through.

123
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,640
Aizawa-san!

124
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,160
As you can see, someone has collapsed!

125
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,240
This is the scene occuring outside Sakura TV right now!

126
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,540
Ukita-san...

127
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,300
S-Shit!! Was it Kira?!

128
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,790
S-Shit!! Was it Kira?!

129
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,950
S-Shit!! Was it Kira?!

130
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,010
Aizawa-san!

131
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,920
Where do you think you're going?

132
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,400
To Ukita, of course.

133
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,850
You can't.

134
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,410
Please compose yourself.

135
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,490
Are you telling me to just shut up and watch TV?!

136
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,560
If this is Kira's work, and you go there, the same thing will happen to you.

137
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,000
If this is Kira's work, and you go there, the same thing will happen to you.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,330
If Kira doesn't have a name, they shouldn't be able to kill!

139
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,060
So why has this happened?!

140
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,180
Were the fake IDs useless?

141
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,930
Maybe... Kira already knew our names?

142
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,270
Maybe... Kira already knew our names?

143
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,570
That's a possibility.

144
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,710
But if Kira did know that, it would have been a lot easier for them to kill us first.

145
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,300
But if Kira did know that, it would have been a lot easier for them to kill us first.

146
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,670
According to my theory, Kira needs a name and a face, but having watched this, it seems that the probability of Kira being able to kill someone solely by knowing their face isn't zero.

147
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,250
According to my theory, Kira needs a name and a face, but having watched this, it seems that the probability of Kira being able to kill someone solely by knowing their face isn't zero.

148
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,900
According to my theory, Kira needs a name and a face, but having watched this, it seems that the probability of Kira being able to kill someone solely by knowing their face isn't zero.

149
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,210
According to my theory, Kira needs a name and a face, but having watched this, it seems that the probability of Kira being able to kill someone solely by knowing their face, isn't zero.

150
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,960
According to my theory, Kira needs a name and a face, but having watched this, it seems that the probability of Kira being able to kill someone solely by knowing their face, isn't zero.

151
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,080
Right now, the only think that I can say, is that Kira is inside the station, or at least somewhere where they can monitor the people entering--

152
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,260
Right now, the only think that I can say, is that Kira is inside the station, or at least somewhere where they can monitor the people entering--

153
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,930
Right now, the only think that I can say, is that Kira is inside the station, or at least somewhere where they can monitor the people entering--

154
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,160
If you think that Kira is around that area, there's even more of a reason to go!

155
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,410
If you think that Kira is around that area, there's even more of a reason to go!

156
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,190
There's always the possibility that they set up surveillance cameras.

157
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,130
If you carelessly rush out there now, you'll only be killed.

158
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,060
You! I thought that you were risking your life to catch Kira!

159
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,920
You! I thought that you were risking your life to catch Kira!

160
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,060
Risking your life, and allowing someone to easily take it, are two completely different things.

161
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,030
Risking your life, and allowing someone to easily take it are two completely different things.

162
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,410
What?!

163
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,190
Try and hold back.

164
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,440
Now that Ukita-san has been killed, if you were to lose your life too...

165
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,970
Now that Ukita-san has been killed, if you were to lose your life too...

166
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,830
To the police; please decide whether you will cooperate with me in creating a new world,

167
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,240
and announce your answer of "yes" or "no" in four days' time, during the 6 o'clock news on the 22nd of April.

168
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,360
I have prepared videos for both "yes" and "no" responses.

169
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,980
What the hell is going on?!

170
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,350
Hey! What do you think you're playing at?!

171
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,720
Hey! What do you think you're playing at?!

172
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,720
Where's the studio that's airing the Kira tapes?!

173
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,580
It's a patrol van! A patrol van has charged into Sakura TV!

174
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,080
That's one way of entering the station without revealing your identity...

175
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,280
But who is it?

176
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,870
Police! Stop the broadcast!

177
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,620
Police! Stop the broadcast!

178
00:09:59,620 --> 00:09:59,950
W-What's going on?

179
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,000
W-What's going on?

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,270
I'm telling you to stop the Kira tapes!

181
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:03,980
W-Wait a second Detective. If we stop this tape, we'll be killed by Kira...

182
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,200
W-Wait a second Detective. If we stop this tape, we'll be killed by Kira...

183
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,330
W-Wait a second Detective. If we stop this tape, we'll be killed by Kira...

184
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,550
Hand them over!

185
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,600
If you do that, you can save your life right now, if nothing else.

186
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,090
W-What are you thinking?! Are you insane?

187
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,970
W-What are you thinking?! Are you insane?

188
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,010
This is the result of you covering the Kira case as though they are some kind of star.

189
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,980
"You reap what you sow", don't you agree?

190
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,520
I want all the copies as well.

191
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,630
Don't even think about trying to get out of this now!

192
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,030
O-Okay! I'll get them, I'll get them, so stop waving that pistol around!

193
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,350
O-Okay! I'll get them, I'll get them, so stop waving that pistol around!

194
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,320
O-Okay! I'll get them, I'll get them, so stop waving that pistol around!

195
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,840
O-Okay! I'll get them, I'll get them, so stop waving that pistol around!

196
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,040
Your eyes are crazy...

197
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,760
Finally, a single police car has arrived outside Sakura TV.

198
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,480
So we're not the only ones... there are still others in the force that want to stand up and fight!

199
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,170
So we're not the only ones... there are still others in the force that want to stand up and fight!

200
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,180
Aizawa-san, you know the cell phone number of Deputy Chief Kitamura, right?

201
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,350
Aizawa-san, you know the cell phone number of Deputy Chief Kitamura, right?

202
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,340
Aizawa, I thought that I told you not to call me.

203
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,930
This is L. I'd like to ask a favor of you.

204
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,580
This is L. I'd like to ask a favor of you.

205
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,900
Upon seeing this broadcast, people connected with the police will act, driven by their own sense of personal justice.

206
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,740
Upon seeing this broadcast, people connected with the police will act, driven by their own sense of personal justice.

207
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,470
I'd like you to control this directly from the top, or this could turn into a disaster.

208
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,790
But on this case, we're...

209
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,300
Both of the policemen that rushed to the scene have collapsed!

210
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,880
W-We will also be evacuating the area!

211
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,050
W-We will also be evacuating the area!

212
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,890
Understood. L, please advise me on how I should command.

213
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,020
Understood. L, please advise me on how I should command.

214
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,010
Understood. L, please advise me on how I should command.

215
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,850
It's Chief Yagami.

216
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,390
Call him back, and hand me the phone.

217
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,750
Please hurry and let me talk to Ryuuzaki.

218
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,000
It's me. Yagami-san, so it was you in the patrol van.

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,190
It's me. Yagami-san, so it was you in the patrol van.

220
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,300
It's me. Yagami-san, so it was you in the patrol van.

221
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,430
Yes... I couldn't stop myself.

222
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,710
Yes... I couldn't stop myself.

223
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,660
I've seized all the tapes, and I'll bring them over to you.

224
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,370
I've seized all the tapes, and I'll bring them over to you.

225
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,570
Are you alright?

226
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,410
I fell more than alright. In fact, I've never felt this alive before!

227
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,810
I fell more than alright. In fact, I've never felt this alive before!

228
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,170
Never mind that, what should I do?

229
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,360
I think the front entrace is dangerous, but I should be fine in the car.

230
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,010
I think the front entrace is dangerous, but I should be fine in the car.

231
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,510
Please wait a minute.

232
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,370
Deputy Kitamura, Chief Yagami was the one who charged into the station.

233
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,870
Deputy Kitamura, Chief Yagami was the one who charged into the station.

234
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,500
How are your preparations proceeding?

235
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,360
We've done as you asked.

236
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,140
Yagami-san, please leave openly through the front entrance in five minutes.

237
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,920
Yagami-san, please leave openly through the front entrance in five minutes.

238
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,810
Openly? Through the front entrance?

239
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,450
There are to be no gaps! Understood?!

240
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,700
Ensure that you aren't seen!

241
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,560
Kira won't be inside the station; if they're here, they're outside!

242
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,490
Thank you.

243
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,120
I'll drive myself.

244
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,450
Understood.

245
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,670
Listen up!

246
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,180
There's a good chance that Kira may be somewhere within visual range.

247
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,360
Devise methods of searching that ensures you can't be seen.

248
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,010
The police have ignored Kira, and have shown us that they are ready to fight.

249
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,960
I-It takes courage for me to say this... but what they are doing is right! This is right!

250
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,370
I-It takes courage for me to say this... but what they are doing is right! This is right!

251
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,020
I-It takes courage for me to say this... but what they are doing is right! This is right!

252
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,990
I-It takes courage for me to say this... but what they are doing is right! This is right!

253
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,920
This is the position a constitutional nation should take!

254
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,100
My name is Tanakabara Kouki.

255
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,350
The announcer for NHN's "Golden news"... Tanakabara Kouki!

256
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,000
The announcer for NHN's "Golden news"... Tanakabara Kouki!

257
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,620
Chief!

258
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,920
Chief Yagami!

259
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,290
Ryuuzaki... I apologize for acting on impulse.

260
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,310
Ryuuzaki... I apologize for acting on impulse.

261
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,160
It seems I got a little too emotional.

262
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,790
Not at all.

263
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,890
All the envelopes and tapes sent by Kira are in here.

264
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,650
Thank you very much.

265
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,640
L-Let me rest for a while...

266
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,390
L-Let me rest for a while...

267
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,360
Yagami-san, I won't let this go to waste.

268
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,320
Yagami-san, I won't let this go to waste.

269
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,320
It's postmarked from Osaka.

270
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,410
However, Kira is able to manipulate people before death, so they wouldn't have to go to Osaka themselves to mail this.

271
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,550
However, Kira is able to manipulate people before death, so they wouldn't have to go to Osaka themselves to mail this.

272
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,820
Aizawa-san, can I ask you to analyze these?

273
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,340
Aizawa-san, can I ask you to analyze these?

274
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,390
I'm good at that. I'll do a thorough job.

275
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,230
I'm good at that. I'll do a thorough job.

276
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,840
Please do.

277
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,010
I'll confirm the contents of the copied tapes.

278
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,750
How is it, Ryuuzaki?

279
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,560
It was an interesting video.

280
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,240
If the police agree to cooperate with Kira, there are orders to broadcast video three, and if they refuse, video four is to be played.

281
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,100
If the police agree to cooperate with Kira, there are orders to broadcast video three, and if they refuse, video four is to be played.

282
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,750
If the police agree to cooperate with Kira, there are orders to broadcast video three, and if they refuse, video four is to be played.

283
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,380
On video three, there are detailed conditions regarding the cooperation.

284
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,760
In a nutshell, it's to report information on more criminals.

285
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,660
Even if they've committed less serious crimes, there are instructions to pick out those who harm others, and those that abuse the weak and vulnerable.

286
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,010
Even if they've committed less serious crimes, there are instructions to pick out those who harm others, and those that abuse the weak and vulnerable.

287
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,340
Kira will then decide whether to pass judgement on them or not.

288
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,560
In addition, as proof that the police are willing to cooperate, they order both L and a senior member of the police to appear on TV, and announce "We will cooperate with Kira".

289
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,370
In addition, as proof that the police are willing to cooperate, they order both L and a senior member of the police to appear on TV, and announce "We will cooperate with Kira".

290
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,270
In addition, as proof that the police are willing to cooperate, they order both L and a senior member of the police to appear on TV, and announce "We will cooperate with Kira".

291

In addition, as proof that the police are willing to cooperate, they order both L and a senior member of the police to appear on TV, and announce "We will cooperate with Kira".

292
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,430
By exposing the faces of myself and a senior policeman, should the police attempt anything funny, they would be able to kill us.

293
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,730
By exposing the faces of myself and a senior policeman, should the police attempt anything funny, they would be able to kill us.

294
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,270
By exposing the faces of myself and a senior policeman, should the police attempt anything funny, they would be able to kill us.

295
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,430
What about the contents of the fourth video, if we answer "no"?

296
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,310
It's more or less the same thing, but said in a different way.

297
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,990
The answer is bound to be "no", Yagami-san. Please authorize Sakura TV to play tape four.

298
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,580
The answer is bound to be "no", Yagami-san. Please authorize Sakura TV to play tape four.

299
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,270
I think that it's a great shame that you've chosen to answer "no".

300
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,690
Since this reply indicates that the police will persistently fight against me,

301
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,090
I will have to take the life of the Chief of the Japanese Police Force, or alternatively, the life of the person directing this investigation, known as L.

302
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:38,350
I will have to take the life of the Chief of the Japanese Police Force, or alternatively, the life of the person directing this investigation, known as L.

303
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,140
The Chief of Police or L?

304
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:46,080
Which one of you will pay the price for deciding not to help me create a peaceful world?

305
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,190
Please decide within four days.

306
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,110
God is on my side after all.

307
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,830
Well, when I say "God", I mean "Shinigami".

308
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,430
Well, when I say "God", I mean "Shinigami".

309
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,000
Looks that way.

310
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,890
Another Shinigami has come down to Earth, and that Shinigami's Death Note has passed into the hands of a human who supports Kira.

311
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,760
Another Shinigami has come down to Earth, and that Shinigami's Death Note has passed into the hands of a human who supports Kira.

312
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,360
It's highly probable that this Kira has the eyes of a Shinigami.

313
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,210
In other words, this Kira's ability to kill is far greater than mine.

314
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,200
In other words, this Kira's ability to kill is far greater than mine.

315
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,990
Given the current situation, it'll be fine to leave them alone for a while.

316
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,290
There's a good chance that L will be buried.

317
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,670
But, what I can't forgive, is that they've lowered Kira's dignity by using such inferior methods!

318
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:38,380
But, what I can't forgive, is that they've lowered Kira's dignity by using such inferior methods!

319
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,620
It'll also be problematic if the fake messes up, gets caught, and people find out about the Death Note.

320
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,720
It'll also be problematic if the fake messes up, gets caught, and people find out about the Death Note.

321
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,500
I can't leave them to their own devices for too long.

322
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,300
Right now, the ideal thing for me to do would be... to help out with the investigation, and grasp both L's and the fake Kira's moves.

323
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,550
Right now, the ideal thing for me to do would be... to help out with the investigation, and grasp both L's and the fake Kira's moves.

324
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,800
Right now, the ideal thing for me to do would be... to help out with the investigation, and grasp both L's and the fake Kira's moves.

325
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,530
Ryuuzaki, it's just as we thought.

326
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,500
Ryuuzaki, it's just as we thought.

327
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,160
Of their own accord, world leaders have discussed this, and they want the real L to appear on TV.

328
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,690
Of their own accord, world leaders have discussed this, and they want the real L to appear on TV.

329
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,890
That is the correct choice to make, but we still have three days, so let's try and think of some countermeasures.

330
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,690
That is the correct choice to make, but we still have three days, so let's try and think of some countermeasures.

331
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,950
That is the correct choice to make, but we still have three days, so let's try and think of some countermeasures.

332
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,980
I'd be pretty upset... if I was killed by someone who's merely jumping onto the "Kira" bandwagon.

333
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,000
I'd be pretty upset... if I was killed by someone who's merely jumping onto the "Kira" bandwagon.

334
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,860
What do you mean by that, Ryuuzaki?!

335
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,710
What do you mean by that, Ryuuzaki?!

336
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,720
The probability of this Kira being a fake is extremely high.

337
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,930
No, a "second Kira" is probably a better description.

338
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,220
No, a "second Kira" is probably a better description.

339
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,100
A second Kira?

340
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,860
What makes you think that there's a second Kira?

341
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,200
Please explain this to us.

342
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,080
Firstly, if you look at the first tape used to convince the TV station's employees,

343
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,760
Firstly, if you look at the first tape used to convince the TV station's employees,

344
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,620
it's noticeable that the victims of the predicted deaths, were only reported on the "Wide Show" or in women's magazines.

345
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,030
Wide Show is a news and gossip show that airs in Japan.

346
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:02,330
it's noticeable that the victims of the predicted deaths, were only reported on the "Wide Show" or in women's magazines.

347
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,620
The real Kira wouldn't have bothered with such small fry.

348
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,350
But, if we think of them as a second Kira... it'd have been too risky for them to use any criminal that the real Kira may potentially kill before them.

349
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,760
But, if we think of them as a second Kira... it'd have been too risky for them to use any criminal that the real Kira may potentially kill before them.

350
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,080
Ryuuzaki, what are the chances of there being a second Kira?

351
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,200
Ryuuzaki, what are the chances of there being a second Kira?

352
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,850
This time it's over 70%.

353
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,510
Either way, I don't like their methods... It's unlike Kira.

354
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,070
Either way, I don't like their methods... It's unlike Kira.

355
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,630
"Unlike"?

356
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,830
Up till now, with the exception of those chasing after them, Kira has avoided sacrificing the innocent.

357
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,030
Up till now, with the exception of those chasing after them, Kira has avoided sacrificing the innocent.

358
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,780
If we can catch one of the Kiras, I think that we'll get hints to help catch the other.

359
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,010
If we can catch one of the Kiras, I think that we'll get hints to help catch the other.

360
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,020
Yagami-san, would it be okay if we asked your son to help us in the investigation?

361
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,940
Yagami-san, would it be okay if we asked your son to help us in the investigation?

362
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,860
So, am I to understand that you no longer suspect him?

363
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,720
So, am I to understand that you no longer suspect him?

364
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,740
No, I can't say that I don't still suspect him, but I am counting on his skills of deduction.

365
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,050
No, I can't say that I don't still suspect him, but I am counting on his skills of deduction.

366
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,180
No, I can't say that I don't still suspect him, but I am counting on his skills of deduction.

367
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,970
So that's what you mean...

368
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,660
If this is what my son wants, I see no reason to stop him.

369
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,030
Thank you very much.

370
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,710
But, please don't tell him that we suspect that this Kira may be a fake.

371
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,580
But, please don't tell him that we suspect that this Kira may be a fake.

372
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,950
Please give the impression that we're determinedly pursuing one Kira.

373
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,400
Hey, Misa... I kindly gave that Death Note to you, so why don't you use it more for yourself?

374
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,130
Hey, Misa... I kindly gave that Death Note to you, so why don't you use it more for yourself?

375
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,880
Hey, Misa... I kindly gave that Death Note to you, so why don't you use it more for yourself?

376
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,060
I am using it for myself.

377
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,000
After all, I support Kira!

378
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
So I want to know what kind of person Kira is.

379
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,720
And I want to meet and talk to them.

380
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,560
That's why I went through the trouble of sending those tapes to the TV station, and ensured that I could get Kira to notice me!

381
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,480
Kira will be interested. I'm sure of it!

382
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,570
Kira will be interested. I'm sure of it!

383
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,140
That's a dangerous game you're playing.

384
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,300
You could be killed. You know that, right?

385
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,230
You could be killed. You know that, right?

386
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,760
It'll be okay. I'm sure Kira is kind to innocent girls.

387
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,850
It'll be okay. I'm sure Kira is kind to innocent girls.

388
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,420
And if it does come to that...

389
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,870
Misa is stronger because she has the eyes!

390
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,050
To be continued

391
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,250
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

392
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,250
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

393
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,380
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

394
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,380
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

395
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:39,160
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

396
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:39,160
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

397
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:45,940
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

398
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:45,940
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

399
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,010
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

400
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,010
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

401
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,150
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

402
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,150
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

403
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:03,800
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

404
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:03,800
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

405
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,960
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

406
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,960
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

407
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,440
Samazama na negative ni

408
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,440
I'm not so weak,

409
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,770
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

410
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,770
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

411
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,630
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

412
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,630
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

413
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,080
Preview

414
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:37,420
I've got to stay one step ahead of the investigation in finding out about the fake Kira.

415
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,950
But still...

416
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,060
I wonder what they're like...

417
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,290
Fake Kira...

418
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,090
Next Time

419
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,090
Love
