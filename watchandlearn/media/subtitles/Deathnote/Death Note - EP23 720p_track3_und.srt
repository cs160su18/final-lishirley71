00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,630
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

89
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,580
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

90
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,500
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

91
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,590
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,650
So, you're saying that one of them is Kira, right?

93
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,560
Yes, and I've got plenty of proof.

94
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,310
The victim was Mr. "H".

95
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,480
Soon Kira's identity will become clear!

96
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:35,730
If Higuchi is similar to the second Kira and can kill someone solely by knowing their face, Matsuda-san will die.

97
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,190
I-It's him?!

98
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,950
I-It's him?!

99
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,440
Don't fuck with me! You should at least know the names of your employees!

100
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,040
Don't fuck with me! You should at least know the names of your employees!

101
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,720
I've still got two hours...

102
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,600
Higuchi's status confirmed.

103
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,390
He's got a bag with him.

104
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,430
I'm in pursuit.

105
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,810
I'll kill him for sure...

106
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,980
I'm going to have it all!

107
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,980
Frenzy

108
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,820
Cosme Misa.

109
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,990
Brilliant gloss.

110
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,070
The sparkle of an angel.

111
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,290
Misa's Cashmere Rouge.

112
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,300
The commercials are ending, Ryuuzaki.

113
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,110
Is that so?

114
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,490
I ended up drinking with the eight of them, including Kira.

115
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,850
That's fascinating.

116
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:43,950
I can't say any more right now, or those who were present at the time might figure out who Kira is.

117
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,890
Of course. Please take your time and reveal Kira's identity when you're ready.

118
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,490
Please set the channels so Audio One is streaming from Higuchi's car and Audio Two from Sakura TV.

119
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,110
It's as we thought. Higuchi's making sure to watch the TV even from his car.

120
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,730
Going back to what you said earlier, have you actually met Kira in the flesh?

121
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,320
Yes, although at the time, I hadn't realized who Kira was.

122
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,600
However, I think it's really brave of you to come onto the show, considering that Kira has seen your face.

123
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,810
Are you okay with this?

124
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:20,440
Yes. While I was investigating, I discovered that Kira needs two things in order to kill.

125
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,220
I know there are a lot of rumors around this topic, but I've figured it out.

126
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,940
A face... and a name...

127
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,420
A face... and a name...

128
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,620
But in my case, Kira doesn't know my name.

129
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,820
So, he's doing this because he thinks that I won't be able to kill him as I don't know his real name, eh?

130
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,320
Does this mean that he's destroyed all evidence of his real name?

131
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,510
If he's thought as far ahead as destroying his old records... even if I went to Yoshida Productions...

132
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,030
If he's thought as far ahead as destroying his old records... even if I went to Yoshida Productions...

133
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,760
Rem, what do you think?

134
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,040
Think? About what?

135
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,670
"Rem"? Who's that? He got into the car alone...

136
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,500
"Rem"? Who's that? He got into the car alone...

137
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,780
"Rem"? Who's that? He got into the car alone...

138
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,150
I can't believe that there would be someone else in there with him.

139
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,420
He's not using a cell phone either... maybe he's using a radio or something?

140
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,390
He's not using a cell phone either... maybe he's using a radio or something?

141
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,390
No, there's no radio in that car. Only our bugging devices, cameras and transmitters.

142
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,130
No, there's no radio in that car. Only our bugging devices, cameras and transmitters.

143
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,520
No, there's no radio in that car. Only our bugging devices, cameras and transmitters.

144
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,440
I'm certain because Weddy placed those devices there.

145
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,310
Even if I go to Yoshida Productions, there's a chance that there won't be any records...

146
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,030
Is he talking to himself?

147
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,870
Why are you asking me? How should I know?

148
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,740
If he's smart, he'd have destroyed any evidence of his real name before going on TV.

149
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,120
Besides, isn't it a little careless of Yoshida Productions to allow me to just waltz in and look for it myself?

150
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,300
Then again, as the only person who was there, I guess I'll be held accountable if anything is stolen.

151
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,880
Somehow, this doesn't look good...

152
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,010
It's okay. He'll go.

153
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,890
Even if the records are at Yoshida Productions, it could just be another false name... then what?!

154
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm guessing in this kind of situation, it's highly likely that he has gone that far.

155
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,740
I'm guessing it's Light and Misa's plan for him to go to Yoshida Productions...

156
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:10,010
But he knows you're Kira, and if things continue as they are, he'll reveal your name.

157
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,820
Those are the facts.

158
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,750
There's less than an hour before the big announcement!

159
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,390
All you can do now is to go and take a look.

160
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,240
Regardless of whether the name on the record is fake or not,

161
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,720
there's no way anyone would suspect you of killing people by using a notebook.

162
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,710
Yeah, I get all that.

163
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,910
But to be on the safe side, it would be best if I killed everyone that I've talked to at Yoshida Productions,

164
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,070
But to be on the safe side, it would be best if I killed everyone that I've talked to at Yoshida Productions,

165
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,370
as well as Misa and her manager.

166
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,190
Wha--?! No! He's going to kill me?!

167
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,720
Wha--?! No! He's going to kill me?!

168
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,290
Stop panicking. He's talking about after he's killed Matsuda-san.

169
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,120
Unless he kills Matsuda-san, there would be no point in him doing that.

170
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,280
You're right, but...

171
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,950
Think carefully. He's the only one you need to kill.

172
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,800
If you start killing those you called earlier, your call records will make you look suspicious.

173
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,010
That's true... you're pretty smart, Rem.

174
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,010
That's true... you're pretty smart, Rem.

175
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,260
Then I'll just manipulate them to delete all their incoming call records before I kill them.

176
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,930
However, the phone company's records will still remain.

177
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,330
There's no way he's talking to himself!

178
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,730
Who is this "Rem"? Who is he talking to?!

179
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,820
Who is this "Rem"? Who is he talking to?!

180
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,240
If he's really having a conversation with someone, it's with... a Shinigami... perhaps?

181
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,640
If he's really having a conversation with someone, it's with... a Shinigami... perhaps?

182
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,440
If he's really having a conversation with someone, it's with... a Shinigami... perhaps?

183
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,140
With someone like this, maybe I should act first...

184
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,990
How about you return the ownership of the notebook to me?

185
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,490
No, all that means is that I'll end up with a pitiful end.

186
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,500
He says that he's got proof.

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Plus if they compare Yotsuba's growth against the deaths that have occurred, no one is going to doubt his story.

188
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,510
Anybody he says is Kira will be labeled Kira for life.

189
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,320
Even if they don't find any hard evidence... my life will be over.

190
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,380
Even if they don't find any hard evidence... my life will be over.

191
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,220
Forget about promotions, I probably won't even be allowed to stay at Yotsuba.

192
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,900
Of course, our staff on this show have structured the program with the assumption that Kira will be watching.

193
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,980
Then, I'd like to address Kira directly...

194
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,710
Kira! Turn yourself in!

195
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,780
Kira! Turn yourself in!

196
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,540
He pretends to be an idiot, but that night he managed to fake his own death to stay alive.

197
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,540
Whatever happens, I must kill him.

198
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,040
Higuchi has arrived at Yoshida Productions.

199
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,710
Here we go...

200
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,720
Left as you enter... the desk right at the far end... in the very bottom drawer...

201
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Left as you enter... the desk right at the far end... in the very bottom drawer...

202
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,870
Left as you enter... the desk right at the far end... in the very bottom drawer...

203
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,760
Yamashita Yaichirou

204
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,760
Manager

205
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,010
So, how are you going to kill him? Show me!

206
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,100
So, how are you going to kill him? Show me!

207
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,010
We're prepared to apprehend Higuchi the moment you give us the signal.

208
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,350
Okay.

209
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,270
Yamashita Taichirou

210
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,280
It's no use! All he's done is make a note of the name, and now he's leaving!

211
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,660
He's not going to kill him here?

212
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,040
Ryuuzaki, should I apprehend him?

213
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,410
We've yet to confirm how he kills.

214
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,040
He might do something once he gets back in his car.

215
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,790
Bring up the inside of Higuchi's car on monitor one.

216
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,730
Higuchi seems surprisingly calm for someone who desperately wants Matsuda-san to be dead.

217
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,300
True... and if he needed the name, he could have taken the records with him instead of putting them back.

218
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,940
True... and if he needed the name, he could have taken the records with him instead of putting them back.

219
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,630
36... 37... 38... 39... 40 seconds.

220
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,750
36... 37... 38... 39... 40 seconds.

221
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,100
36... 37... 38... 39... 40 seconds.

222
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,710
36... 37... 38... 39... 40 seconds.

223
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,750
36... 37... 38... 39... 40 seconds.

224
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,450
Kira is a murderer! I'll never forgive him!

225
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,030
Shit, he won't die!!

226
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,950
What does he mean by that?! "He won't die"?

227
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,130
What does he mean by that?! "He won't die"?

228
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,330
He's already attempted to kill him?

229
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,790
Could writing down their name be how he kills?

230
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,660
What should we do? Wait and see what he does?

231
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,010
I can only assume it means he can kill someone merely by knowing their name and wanting them to die.

232
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,460
What's going on? I can't determine how he's killing people.

233
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,230
What's going on? I can't determine how he's killing people.

234
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,180
If we apprehend him now and attempt to force a confession out, once again he'll...

235
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,350
There are 50 minutes left until the Kira announcement!

236
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,040
Damn it! There's no time left!

237
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,540
He's calling someone.

238
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,190
Most likely Misa-san again.

239
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,110
Bingo!

240
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,380
I know what he looks like...

241
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,130
If I go to the office, there'll be security tapes of that time he snuck in...

242
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,880
If I had the eyes of a Shinigami...

243
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,040
Half my life span, eh?

244
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,380
But if he does reveal my name, my life's as good as over anyways.

245
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,890
Then, I may as well live a short but fulfilled life.

246
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,840
Rem, it's time to do the deal.

247
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,560
Rem, it's time to do the deal.

248
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,400
"Deal"? Who is this "Rem" he keeps talking about?

249
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,680
"Deal"? Who is this "Rem" he keeps talking about?

250
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,750
Is Kira's power really something that's bestowed from above?

251
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,440
I wouldn't like to think so.

252
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,630
In that case, what the hell is "Rem"?

253
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,250
A Shinigami?

254
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,260
Either way, I think we should continue observing him.

255
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,410
We could learn a lot.

256
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,040
We may even discover how he kills.

257
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,050
Now I really am invincible!

258
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,590
Now I'll always have a trick up my sleeve.

259
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,010
We're going after him.

260
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,380
You in the Porsche! Stop!

261
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,370
Pull over to the side! Stop the car!

262
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,700
Bad news. He's been pulled over by a patrol bike.

263
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,870
I'll have to go past him. I'm leaving the rest to you and Aiber.

264
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,580
You were speeding. Let's see your license.

265
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,870
Ah, alright.

266
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,370
Show me the inside of Higuchi's car on full screen.

267
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,460
I wonder where I put my license...

268
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,420
I've got no time for this!

269
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,970
Shiroba Ito - Accidental death

270
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,800
The name "Shiroba Ito" is a pun. "Shirobai" literally means "motorcycle policeman".

271
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,760
You there!!

272
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,060
He's managed to shake off the cop! He's getting away!

273
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,980
What's up with this guy?

274
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,770
This is the Traffic Riot Police--

275
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,650
T-The bike has collided with a truck! It's a complete wreck!

276
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,900
A wreck?! An accidental death?

277
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,630
This is bad...

278
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,250
When Higuchi had his hand in his bag... did he manage to do something then?

279
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,840
More importantly, how did he manage to find out the name of that traffic cop?

280
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,340
Just like the second Kira, could he have known by just looking at him?

281
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,250
Rem... a deal...

282
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,500
No. If he can now kill knowing only the face, he should be able to kill Matsuda immediately, since he knows his face...

283
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,890
No. If he can now kill knowing only the face, he should be able to kill Matsuda immediately, since he knows his face...

284
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,850
No. If he can now kill knowing only the face, he should be able to kill Matsuda immediately, since he knows his face...

285
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,480
What's going on? But...

286
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,600
What's going on? But...

287
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,270
Everyone! I believe that it'll be too dangerous to allow Higuchi to act any further!

288
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,110
Everyone! I believe that it'll be too dangerous to allow Higuchi to act any further!

289
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,870
We're going ahead with his capture.

290
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,360
However, Higuchi is now able to kill just by looking at someone's face, similar to the second Kira.

291
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,020
We'll be making the arrest under that assumption!

292
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,770
Watari, put me through to the Director of the Police Department.

293
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,380
Watari, put me through to the Director of the Police Department.

294
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:08,970
Yes.

295
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,390
This is L.

296
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,560
I've determined who Kira is.

297
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,570
He's currently driving a red Porsche 911 on National Highway Route 1 from Hibiya towards Shibuya.

298
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,360
We'll be apprehending him ourselves, but I need you to inform your men not to approach that Porsche.

299
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,950
Father, after these commercials, it's time for the seventh part of the plan.

300
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,240
Understood.

301
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,660
Demegawa! We'll put our plan into motion during the next set of commercials.

302
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,210
Replace Matsuda and the Presenter with mannequins, and we'll use the audio we prepared to complete the facade.

303
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,420
Then leave the cameras to continue filming and evacuate everyone from the building.

304
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,020
Well then, Yagami-kun. Shall we go too?

305
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,290
Yeah.

306
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,770
I'm sorry Misa-san, but I'm going to leave you immobilized for a while.

307
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,660
What's all this?! Stop messing around!

308
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,060
What's all this?! Stop messing around!

309
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,280
I'm surprised you can pilot a helicopter on top of everything else, Ryuuzaki...

310
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,120
It's simple.

311
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,000
Doesn't seem like Higuchi is heading towards Sakura TV. He's going in the wrong direction.

312
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,670
Considering his route, he's heading towards Yotsuba Headquarters.

313
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,130
You're incredibly brave.

314
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,010
No, I only did what one would expect...

315
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,680
If only I can get back to the office and watch him on the surveillance tapes, I can kill him.

316
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,280
Weddy, did you manage to destroy everything regarding Matsuda-san at Yotsuba Headquarters?

317
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,640
Weddy, did you manage to destroy everything regarding Matsuda-san at Yotsuba Headquarters?

318
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,470
Yes. Is he heading for the Headquarters?

319
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,560
How convenient.

320
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,070
This gives Mr. Yagami and me time to get to the TV station before him and set up an ambush.

321
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,830
Shit! It's not here!

322
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,370
No... it should be on the tape. It's been erased!

323
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,330
No... it should be on the tape. It's been erased!

324
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,090
Did he get in here and erase it himself?

325
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,000
Or is someone betraying me by helping him?

326
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,510
No, they would be arrested as well.

327
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,320
Either way, I don't have much time. I've got to hurry!

328
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,390
Either way, I don't have much time. I've got to hurry!

329
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,440
Finally, it's nearly time for the big announcement.

330
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,750
Yes. I really want to hurry up and get it off my chest.

331
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,680
I understand how you feel, but for now, we're just going to take a quick break.

332
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,100
Damn it! The only thing left is to go to Sakura TV and kill him.

333
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,700
Damn it! The only thing left is to go to Sakura TV and kill him.

334
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,220
Father, it seems that Higuchi is finally heading towards Sakura TV.

335
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,540
He'll be there in less than 15 minutes. Are you okay?

336
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,440
I don't need my own son to worry about me.

337
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm fine, Light.

338
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,510
Have you got anything more to add before you make the announcement?

339
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,750
Let's see...

340
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,340
Everyone, think very carefully about what will happen once Kira has been caught.

341
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,700
Mr. Yagami, it's nearly time.

342
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,260
After all, Kira is evil.

343
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,260
Yes...

344
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,010
Here.

345
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,400
Aiber doesn't like guns, so I'm the only one carrying a gun.

346
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,150
I'm no longer a cop. I'm not allowed to carry one anymore.

347
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,500
I'm no longer a cop. I'm not allowed to carry one anymore.

348
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,450
You're not supposed to use yours in Japan either.

349
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,540
You're so stubborn...

350
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,540
Made it.

351
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,290
Why is no one else here?

352
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,300
Is this a precaution in case today's broadcast really is true?

353
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,260
Well, if there's no one around, it just makes this easier.

354
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,900
We've arrived at Sakura TV.

355
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,600
We're taking up our positions.

356
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
Let's go, Aiber.

357
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,560
Okay, Mogi!

358
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:57,490
We've received a lot of calls and faxes in support of your testimony.

359
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,000
Even the studio is empty?

360
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,010
But I still have to be aware of the camera positions.

361
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,880
We're very sorry, but due to various circumstances, we'll have to end this program.

362
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,880
What?!

363
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,090
Dolls?! It can't be!

364
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,340
Dolls?! It can't be!

365
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,340
Hold it right there, Higuchi!

366
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,040
Don't move!

367
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,850
Give up.

368
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,190
T-This has gotta be some kind of mistake... I've arranged to meet Demegawa-san.

369
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,680
T-This has gotta be some kind of mistake... I've arranged to meet Demegawa-san.

370
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,610
T-This has gotta be some kind of mistake... I've arranged to meet Demegawa-san.

371
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,200
They're all wearing helmets... must be countermeasures against Kira.

372
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,770
They're all wearing helmets... must be countermeasures against Kira.

373
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,900
In that case...

374
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,550
I'm from the Yotsuba Group's developmental labs... let me just find you my card...

375
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,530
I'm from the Yotsuba Group's developmental labs... let me just find you my card...

376
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,330
Chief!

377
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,210
Aiber!

378
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,170
Damn it... I don't want to use one of these, but...

379
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,160
Higuchi's got a gun.

380
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,810
The Chief has been shot. Higuchi managed to escape.

381
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,120
The Chief has been shot. Higuchi managed to escape.

382
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,110
I'm fine... Sorry, Ryuuzaki...

383
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,060
If you hurry after him, you can still catch him.

384
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,190
Hurry!

385
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,070
This isn't good. He's escaped from Sakura TV.

386
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,050
There's no choice.

387
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,980
We've got to actively join this pursuit.

388
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,030
Watari, are you ready?

389
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,540
Yes.

390
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,940
Yagami-kun, please hold onto this for your own protection.

391
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,380
Yagami-kun, please hold onto this for your own protection.

392
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,530
Our opponent is Kira, after all.

393
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,970
No... that's illegal in Japan.

394
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,260
I'm sure Yagami-san said the exact same thing.

395
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,260
Yeah...

396
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,940
Damn...

397
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,400
He's driving all over the place!

398
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,790
Okay, go now!

399
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,400
Okay.

400
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,020
What the hell was that about?! I can only guess it was a trap...

401
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,290
What the hell was that about?! I can only guess it was a trap...

402
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,920
We take a break from our scheduled program to bring you the news.

403
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,080
The program stopped... but I wasn't the one who stopped it...

404
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,500
S-Shit... what's going on?!

405
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,470
S-Shit... what's going on?!

406
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,680
S-Shit... what's going on?!

407
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,720
What the--

408
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,590
So it was a trap after all!

409
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,320
All the patrol cars have tinted windows...

410
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,240
Have they secretly continued their Kira investigation?!

411
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,190
What's this? I thought I asked the police not to get involved.

412
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,090
The only person who'd do this is...

413
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,330
Yes, that's right.

414
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,480
Damn it! There!

415
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,700
It ends here.

416
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,010
Stay back! Don't come near me!

417
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,970
Guess it's over...

418
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,380
Yes... it is.

419
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,740
Yes... it is.

420
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
To be continued

421
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,760
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

422
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,760
This one page of everlasting depression;

423
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,350
hakanai senpou sono meni

424
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,350
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

425
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,620
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

426
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,620
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

427
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,200
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

428
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,200
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

429
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,850
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

430
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,850
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

431
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,700
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

432
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,700
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

433
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,140
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

434
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,140
Who would know of a path to salvation?

435
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,990
World of acquittal,

436
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,990
Menzai no waarudo

437
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,820
words of retribution!

438
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,820
seisai no waado

439
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,560
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,560
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

441
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,550
Redeem the game of law!

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,550
Aganau houritsu geemu

Come, relentless eraser rain.

449
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,900

here are the morals!

Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

454
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,240

relentless eraser rain.

Preview

458
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,120
"Those whose names are written in this notebook will die."

459
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,840
"This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when they write his/her name."

460
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,920
"Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected."

461
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,020
Next Time

462
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,020
Resurrection
