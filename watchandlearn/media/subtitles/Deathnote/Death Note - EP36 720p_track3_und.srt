Understood.

99
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,490
Take off everything you're wearing and put them in there.

100
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,700
You can use this blanket.

101
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,290
Takada-san, are you okay?

102
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,930
Yagami-kun.

103
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,310
I've done everything you said, placing my own life as the top priority...

104
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,100
I've done everything you said, placing my own life as the top priority...

I've done it all! Hurry and come, save me!

106

Takada Kiyomi. On 26th January 2013, at 2:32pm, burnt all her belongings and anything written down before burning herself to death.

Takada Kiyomi. On 26th January 2013, at 2:32pm, burnt all her belongings and anything written down before burning herself to death.

110
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,040
It brings me great sorrow to tell you that among the two bodies found at the scene,

111
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,440
one of them has been identified as announcer Takada Kiyomi, as confirmed by forensic detectives.

112
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,950
Inside the church that burned down was a 2-ton truck carrying a motorcycle inside.

113
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,340
They suspect the cause of the fire to be the ignition of gasoline.

114
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,370
What worries me now... relates to choosing the next spokesperson.

115
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,170
What worries me now... relates to choosing the next spokesperson.

116
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,590
The word of Kira-sama is something that cannot be stopped.

117
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:48,460
We deeply regret announcer Takada passing away, but it seems she didn't really have the qualifications as a spokesperson.

118
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,950
As expected, this is no task for a woman.

119
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,690
Kira-sama, please choose us as your spokesperson!

120
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,360
No! Return to Sakura TV--

121
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,140
This is awful...

122
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,690
Isn't it?

123
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,050
The second the dead body was confirmed as Takada, the fight to become Kira's new spokesperson has erupted again.

124
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,260
The second the dead body was confirmed as Takada, the fight to become Kira's new spokesperson has erupted again.

125
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,100
Last night's judgment unfolded perfectly.

126
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,520
That could only mean that Takada and Mikami kept in close touch.

127
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,080
There is no problem.

128
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,720
It's Near!

129
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,040
L.

130
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,680
Yes?

131
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,000
I know I'm interfering, but regarding our meeting...

132
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,400
The 28th at 1pm is alright?

133
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,990
Yes.

134
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,730
As expected, it hasn't changed.

135
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,830
It's just as I thought.

136
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,410
Now there isn't a single doubt.

137
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,600
Alright then. The day after tomorrow, on the 28th.

138
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,800
Correct.

139
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,960
So it's the day after tomorrow, huh?

140
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,790
Things are getting pretty exciting!

141
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,840
Yeah.

142
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,270
Who knows what Near wants to show us though...

143
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,040
Matsuda... Ide...

144
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,340
Matsuda... Ide...

145
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,620
All of us might die on that day.

146
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,070
Do you understand that?

147
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,600
Gevanni.

148
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,320
Yes?

149
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,620
Are you able to make it?

150
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,080
Yes.

151
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,250
I'll be fine.

152
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,580
Commander Lester. Lidner. Gevanni.

153
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,970
Commander Lester. Lidner. Gevanni.

154
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,010
Commander Lester. Lidner. Gevanni.

155
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,420
Let's do our best.

156
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,720
28th January, 2013

157
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,980
Everyone, good morning.

158
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,720
Everyone, good morning.

159
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,840
G-Good morning.

160
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,110
G-Good morning.

161
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,240
First...

162
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,000
I've released Amane.

163
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,370
Please call her to confirm it.

164
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,010
I dunno what's going on. Maybe it's a compensation... I ended up in a Teito Hotel Deluxe Suite though! Feels so good!

165
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,050
I dunno what's going on. Maybe it's a compensation... I ended up in a Teito Hotel Deluxe Suite though! Feels so good!

166
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,740
I dunno what's going on. Maybe it's a compensation... I ended up in a Teito Hotel Deluxe Suite though! Feels so good!

167
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,510
I dunno what's going on. Maybe it's a compensation... I ended up in a Teito Hotel Deluxe Suite though! Feels so good!

168
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,120
Oh, really? I see.

169
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,570
Oh, really? I see.

170
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,770
Please stay there for a while.

171
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,220
Okaaaaaaaay~

172
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,680
Near, please switch over to Mogi.

173
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,410
We keep the notebook locked up, and need everyone's security number.

174
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,070
We keep the notebook locked up, and need everyone's security number.

175
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,780
Understood. I'll connect you.

176
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,160
Mogi here. The number is... 62-324.

177
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,230
Mogi here. The number is... 62-324.

178
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,730
Mogi here. The number is... 62-324.

179
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,790
Mogi here. The number is... 62-324.

180
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,760
My number is the only one left...

181
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,240
The murderers notebook.

182
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,450
"How to use:

183
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,320
The human whose name is written in this note shall die.

184
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,310
The note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when they write his/her name.

185
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,940
Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.

186
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,220
If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen as it is written.

187
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,790
If the cause of death is not specified, by default, the person will simply die of a heart attack.

188
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:42,640
Should a cause of death be specified, a further 6 minutes and 40 seconds are granted to write any further details."

189
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,050
Near, I have the notebook. I will definitely be the one holding onto it.

190
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,960
Near, I have the notebook. I will definitely be the one holding onto it.

191
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,220
Near, I have the notebook. I will definitely be the one holding onto it.

192
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,220
Is it alright with you if Mr. Aizawa carries it, L?

193
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:03,670
Near, I've already considered that it would be best for you to have Aizawa carry it.

194
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,480
Thank you very much.

195
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,860
Very well then. See you there.

196
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,990
With this, everything ends.

197
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,450
No...

198
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,250
It begins today.

199
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,820
Kira's perfect world.

200
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,410
All who know of the notebook... will die.

201
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,010
All who know of the notebook... will die.

202
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,980
All who know of the notebook... will die.

203
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,570
Near is inside, no mistaking it.

204
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,050
So, let's go.

205
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,050
Near, you're very much inferior to L, you are not qualified to wear his mask.

206
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,070
Near, you're very much inferior to L, you are not qualified to wear his mask.

207
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,980
Near, you're very much inferior to L, you are not qualified to wear his mask.

208
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,220
L, those four are from the SPK.

209
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,340
And the one wearing the mask is Near.

210
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,850
B-But, I can't accept this!

211
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,760
B-But, I can't accept this!

212
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,290
You freely accuse someone of being Kira, yet you are the one wearing a mask to save only yourself!

213
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,400
You freely accuse someone of being Kira, yet you are the one wearing a mask to save only yourself!

214
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,940
It is a precaution. There's a chance that everyone's face here, excluding mine, has already been seen by Kira.

215
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,930
It is a precaution. There's a chance that everyone's face here, excluding mine, has already been seen by Kira.

216
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,020
That means that their name may already have been written down.

217
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,580
That's why, for one hour--

218
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,400
No, for thirty minutes, allow me to see if anyone here is being manipulated and dies.

219
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,400
W-What's that all about? To wait and see if we die or not?

220
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,780
No. If Light-kun is indeed Kira, I can't say it won't happen.

221
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,440
Especially now that our existence no longer has any meaning.

222
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,590
From here on, it's just wasting time.

223
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,950
Near...

224
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,960
I never thought holding back my laughter would be this hard.

225
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,310
He's waiting for him to come.

226
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,640
I can see through it.

227
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,220
Near!

228
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,970
It's been over 30 minutes and nothing has happened!

229
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,250
Of course not.

230
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,180
Because Kira isn't here.

231
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,190
Very well. Everyone seems to be okay.

232
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,940
I'll take off my mask now.

233
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,380
What is it, Near?

234
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,330
Are you still waiting on something?

235
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,940
Waiting... That's exactly it.

236
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,960
Waiting... That's exactly it.

237
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,280
I am waiting... for the one who will complete our circle, to come.

238
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,710
I am waiting... for the one who will complete our circle, to come.

239
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,850
The one who will complete the circle?

240
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,870
He'll be here shortly.

241
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,680
That's what we are waiting for.

242
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,610
This building is a sealed room. You can't see inside without opening that door.

243
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,480
He will surely come through that door.

244
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,560
Or at the very least, peep through it.

245
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,870
Who are you saying is coming?

246
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,720
The one who is currently carrying out the judgments for Kira; X-Kira.

247
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,440
The one who is currently carrying out the judgments for Kira; X-Kira.

248
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
He'll definitely bring the notebook and come.

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,870
And then, he will see my face and write down my name.

250
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,130
And then, he will see my face and write down my name.

251
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,320
No, he'll kill everyone here who knows of the notebook.

252
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,890
No, he'll kill everyone here who knows of the notebook.

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,220
I-I don't understand! What are you saying?

254
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,200
I-I don't understand! What are you saying?

255
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,410
This third person will come with the notebook to kill us all?!

256
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,860
And we're just gonna sit back and watch?!

257
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,220
Yes, now listen...

258
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,870
If that person comes through the door, only greet him.

259
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,000
And if you see the door open slightly, pretend you didn't notice.

260
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,750
T-That's just foolish!

261
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,750
T-That's just foolish!

262
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,840
He's already here!

263
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,270
God!!

264
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,740
Eliminate!

265
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,850
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!

266
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,520
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!

267
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,100
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!

268
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,790
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!

269
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,720
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

270
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,250
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

271
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:18,880
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

272
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,660
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

273
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,630
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

274
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,030
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate...

275
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,880
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate...

276
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,710
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate...

277
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,650
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate...

278
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,960
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate...

279
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,220
Please, don't move!

280
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,300
It's okay, we won't die!

281
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,330
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

282
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,140
How can you say that we won't, Near?

283
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,120
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

284
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,920
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

285
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,750
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

286
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,220
I modified the notebook.

287
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,730
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

288
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,490
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

289
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,570
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

290
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,160
I replaced the pages when I was in direct contact with the notebook.

291
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,750
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

292
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,540
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

293
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,340
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

294
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,170
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

295
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:44,070
The one currently outside, when judging as Kira, wrote exactly one page per day.

296
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,150
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

297
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,910
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

298
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,990
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

299
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,170
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

300
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:43,960
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

301
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,760
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

302
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,610
Even if he writes our names now, we won't die.

303
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,590
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

304
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,570
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

305
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,330
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

306
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,450
Because I replaced the page set for today!

307
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,410
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!

308
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,070
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

309
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,650
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

311
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,670
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

312
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,170
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

313
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,770
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

314
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,420
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

315
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,630
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

316
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,830
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

317
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:02,930
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!!!

318
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:28,820
X-Kira is on the other side of the door, and he will take another look inside here to confirm our deaths.

319
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,200
You may restrain him then.

320
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,410
From there, we seize the notebook, and whoever's name isn't written down, is Kira.

321
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,420
I-It's true that... the one whose name isn't written down would be Kira.

322
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,970
I-It's true that... the one whose name isn't written down would be Kira.

323
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,170
I-It's true that... the one whose name isn't written down would be Kira.

324
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,920
It's just...

325
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,920
Just as planned! Just as planned! JUST AS PLANNED!!

326
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,590
Just as planned! Just as planned! JUST AS PLANNED!!

327
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,060
Just as planned! Just as planned! JUST AS PLANNED!!

328
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,870
The modification of the notebook... I knew about it.

329
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,440
The modification of the notebook... I knew about it.

330
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,780
Near, you have completely and utterly lost!

331
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,100
The notebook you altered was a fake, one I had Mikami prepare!

332
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,000
And so, the notebook that Mikami is writing in, is the real one, which had been hidden until now!

333
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,350
I had Mikami create a fake notebook... While sending pages to Takada from the real notebook.

334
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,920
I had Mikami create a fake notebook... While sending pages to Takada from the real notebook.

335
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,870
Therefore, the one doing the real judgments was Takada.

336
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,690
Therefore, the one doing the real judgments was Takada.

337
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:53,040
As for Mikami, there were times he deliberately wrote names in the fake note to be witnessed by his tail.

338
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,320
Except during those times, the one really judging was Takada.

339
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,300
This made it look like the real notebook was in Mikami's hands.

340
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,460
Mikami's schedule is precise; he leads an exceptionally punctual life.

341
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,540
He writes exactly one page per day; no more, no less...

342
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,760
Near, you must have noticed this and made your plan.

343
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,110
That is, you could easily determine which page would be used for the day we meet.

344
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,160
Then all you had to do was to replace the page for that day.

345
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,660
By doing that, those whose names are written in the notebook will not die.

346
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,850
That was your plan!

347
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,410
And that's why you couldn't change the date of our meeting.

348
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,750
But seeing how we knew that the notebook would be modifed, I had Mikami check the fake notebook every day.

349
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,710
But seeing how we knew that the notebook would be modifed, I had Mikami check the fake notebook every day.

350
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,170
I have confirmed it.

351
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,090
At that moment, I knew I had won.

352
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,600
The one Mikami brought with him today, is the hidden, real notebook!

353
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,580
But Near... you did have a chance to win.

354
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,310
But Near... you did have a chance to win.

355
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,680
You're too soft.

356
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,950
And far inferior to L...

357
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,850
If it were L, he would've thought of the possibility of a fake notebook, and tested it.

358
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,330
You had the chance...

359
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,550
I'm rather disappointed in you.

360
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,860
You're no rival to me.

361
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,540
You tried to win too beautifully...

362
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,110
Oh well, because of you... everyone dies.

363
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,700
Oh well, because of you... everyone dies.

364
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,840
Oh well, because of you... everyone dies.

365
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,960
And as for me... This will be my absolute win as Kira.

366
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,320
And as for me... This will be my absolute win as Kira.

367
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,100
The one outside... are you done writing down the names?

368
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,410
The one outside... are you done writing down the names?

369
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,170
God!

370
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,090
Yes, I'm done.

371
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,720
N-No, I can't laugh yet... I gotta hold it back!

372
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,700
N-No, I can't laugh yet... I gotta hold it back!

373
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,180
N-No, I can't laugh yet... I gotta hold it back!

374
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,230
N-No, I can't laugh yet... I gotta hold it back!

375
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,770
Everyone will die in 40 seconds.

376
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,460
35 seconds...

377
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,190
35 more seconds and I get to declare my victory!

378
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,980
Don't you find it strange?

379
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,110
Why does he answer your question, "Are you done writing down the names?", so honestly?

380
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,460
Who knows? Maybe he's an honest guy.

381
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,260
Or no, perhaps he left himself plenty of leeway?

382
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,780
Or just maybe your plot has been seen through.

383
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,710
Then we really might be done for!

384
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,270
Mikami Teru. If you don't mind, would you please come in?

385
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,740
Mikami Teru. If you don't mind, would you please come in?

386
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,010
Mikami Teru. If you don't mind, would you please come in?

387
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,620
I know you are currently taking over Kira's judgments.

388
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,800
If you wrote down our names, there's nothing to fear.

389
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,220
Please, enter.

390
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,660
Mikami Teru? Right. Don't just hide out there, come inside.

391
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,620
Mikami Teru? Right. Don't just hide out there, come inside.

392
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,800
Mikami Teru? Right. Don't just hide out there, come inside.

393
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,400
God!

394
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,510
Mikami... you did well!

395
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,950
Mikami... you did well!

396
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,260
How much time has passed since you first wrote down a name?

397
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,870
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

398
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,330
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

399
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,820
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

400
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,220
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

401
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,600
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

402
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,880
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

403
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,160
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

404
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,530
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

405
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,910
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

406
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,520
30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

407
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,560
Near, it's my victory!

408
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,770
Near, it's my victory!

409
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,610
40!!

410
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

411
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,330
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

412
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,330
This one page of everlasting depression;

413
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,250
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

414

hakanai senpou sono meni

415

418
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,100
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

419
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,750
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

420
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,750
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

422

judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

423
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,040
Who would know of a path to salvation?

424
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,040
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

425

Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

I'm Kira.

450
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,880
