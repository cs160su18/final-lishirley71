92
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,440
Every now and again one should go out into the sunlight.

93
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,200
What am I... supposed to do now?

94
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
What am I... supposed to do now?

95
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,050
Father

96
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,480
Ryuk.

97
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,080
Sidoh! What are you doing here?

98
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,070
Sidoh! What are you doing here?

99
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,870
Hey, quit following me!

100
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,870
Give me my notebook back.

101
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,830
I thought that might be it...

102
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,930
Erm... actually, it's gotten a little complicated... and even I don't know where it is at the moment.

103
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,410
Erm... actually, it's gotten a little complicated... and even I don't know where it is at the moment.

104
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,600
Erm... actually, it's gotten a little complicated... and even I don't know where it is at the moment.

105
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,220
That's so irresponsible!

106
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,900
You still following me?

107
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,640
Then gimme the notebook back!

108
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,560
I don't know where it is!

109
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,860
You want it, you find it.

110
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,160
Wammy's House is not just any orphanage.

111
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,980
It's like a special institute; they gathered the brightest children there with the aim of raising the second L, in other words, L's successor.

112
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,750
It's like a special institute; they gathered the brightest children there with the aim of raising the second L, in other words, L's successor.

113
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,600
L's successor?

114
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,090
Out of all of them, a young boy named Near stood out as the top student.

115
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,760
Near... is he N?

116
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,100
And the young boy that N mentioned, Mello, was apparently the closest to Near in terms of abilities.

117
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,250
Near is L's successor... there's no doubt about it.

118
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,600
Near is L's successor... there's no doubt about it.

119
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,650
He's the "N" that's controlling the SPK.

120
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,390
No... Mello must have been aiming to become L's successor as well,

121
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,950
No... Mello must have been aiming to become L's successor as well,

122
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,610
in which case, it's highly likely that he'll do whatever it takes to get his hands on the notebook before Near does.

123
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,750
This "Mello" that N was talking about... He doesn't merely "suspect" him, there's no mistaking that he's behind this.

124
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,950
This "Mello" that N was talking about... He doesn't merely "suspect" him, there's no mistaking that he's behind this.

125
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,500
Here are sketches of the two.

126
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,080
No photos were left of either of them.

127
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,120
L's successor... am I fighting L still?

128
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,120
L's successor... am I fighting L still?

129
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,440
In any case, the first thing I need to do is locate the mafia group that Mello's with.

130
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,310
I had Misa look through a list of currently wanted mafia members, and point him out to me using her Shinigami eyes.

131
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,760
I've found one! Someone whose lifespan I can't see!

132
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,190
I've found one! Someone whose lifespan I can't see!

133
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:25,220
Number 105. He's listed as "Jack Neylon", but his real name is Kal Snydar.

134
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,950
Using the Death Note, I manipulated Snydar into sending a sealed letter with the whereabouts of their organization.

135
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,330
It should arrive soon...

136
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,290
Light! The letter has arrived!

137
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,710
They're in LA!

138
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,610
I did it! I've completely outplayed both of them.

139
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,760
With both the notebook and Misa's eyes in my possession, I really am invincible.

140
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,670
Light... Misa was able to help again, wasn't she?

141
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,780
Light... Misa was able to help again, wasn't she?

142
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,910
Yeah. I love you, Misa.

143
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,320
Stare...

144
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,010
Now, all that remains is to test to which extent we can manipulate people with this notebook.

145
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:38,940
I'd like them all to be able to see me and talk to me at least...

146
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,610
The current owner, Snydar... I'll start by getting him to touch the notebook.

147
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:45,610
The current owner, Snydar... I'll start by getting him to touch the notebook.

148
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,950
I guess there's no choice...

149
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,190
Whee... plonk.

150
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,660
Whee... plonk.

151
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,230
What the fuck? The notebook just jumped of its own accord...

152
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,710
It's a notebook that can kill people. It'd hardly be surprising if it turned out to be alive.

153
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,100
B-Boss!! The guy in the weird, dirty costume... is he a new recruit?!

154
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,860
B-Boss!! The guy in the weird, dirty costume... is he a new recruit?!

155
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,560
B-Boss!! The guy in the weird, dirty costume... is he a new recruit?!

156
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,000
B-Boss!! The guy in the weird, dirty costume... is he a new recruit?!

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,090
I'm not a recruit, I'm a Shinigami.

158
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,530
Shinigami?

159
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,810
For me to be visible to the others, just have them touch the notebook.

160
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,810
A-Apparently, if you touch the notebook you'll be able to see it.

161
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,020
A-Apparently, if you touch the notebook you'll be able to see it.

162
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,260
Everyone! I need you to touch the notebook!

163
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,070
I'm not going crazy!!

164
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,550
Alright then.

165
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,990
Everyone, try touching the notebook!

166
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,210
What the hell?!

167
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,660
I never saw anything the last time I touched it!

168
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,250
Boss! Should we kill it?!

169
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,050
It's no use. Humans can't kill me.

170
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,060
Looks like this Shinigami really exists, and is telling the truth...

171
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,520
Ryuk, as of now, I'm relinquishing ownership of this notebook.

172
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,510
Ryuk, as of now, I'm relinquishing ownership of this notebook.

173
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,120
I want you to accompany whoever becomes the next owner.

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,660
What the hell?! You're giving up your ownership?

175
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,280
But if you do that, won't you lose your memory?

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,930
Let me have your notebook.

177
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,010
As long as I do this, even if I relinquish the ownership of my notebook, I won't lose my memories.

178
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,540
I'll cut out pages when you need them.

179
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,260
From now on, you'll have to play the part of Kira. Can you do that?

180
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,390
Of course... but what are you planning to do?

181
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,390
I'm just getting to that...

182
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,890
We can't afford to make any mistakes.

183
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,460
This "chocolate" stuff is really good!

184
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,900
Hey, what you just said, is it really true?

185
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,990
"If the person using the note fails to continously write names of people to be killed within 13 days of each other, then the user will die."

186
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,910
and "If you make this note unusable by tearing it up or burning it, all the humans who have touched the note till then will die."

187
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,120
Are these two rules really fake?

188
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,630
Yeah, they're completely false.

189
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,830
A Shinigami probably wrote that as a joke before giving it to a human.

190
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,860
We can check whether the "13 days" rule is true or not by having someone test it.

191
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,810
The problem here is whether or not Kira has used this notebook before, and if they have, whether they know these rules are fake.

192
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,550
The problem here is whether or not Kira has used this notebook before, and if they have, whether they know these rules are fake.

193
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,910
The problem here is whether or not Kira has used this notebook before, and if they have, whether they know these rules are fake.

194
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,620
If they do know, then they could use these rules... especially this "13 days" rule... it could be used to prove someones innocence.

195
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,160
If they do know, then they could use these rules... especially this "13 days" rule... it could be used to prove someones innocence.

196
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,710
If they do know, then they could use these rules... especially this "13 days" rule... it could be used to prove someones innocence.

197
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,530
If they do know, then they could use these rules... especially this "13 days" rule... it could be used to prove someones innocence.

198
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,560
Sidoh! Keep watch outside.

199
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,950
Sidoh! Keep watch outside.

200
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,910
You'll be useful, as humans won't be able to see you.

201
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,250
Keep watch outside. Got it?

202
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,780
What's with this guy? For a human, he sure is... scary!

203
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,740
What's with this guy? For a human, he sure is... scary!

204
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,260
What's with this guy? For a human, he sure is... scary!

205
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,430
This is Yagami.

206
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,050
This is Kira.

207
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,250
What did you say?!

208
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,850
Kira?

209
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,570
The notebook that was in the hands of the Japanese investigation has been stolen by criminals, right?

210
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,390
Kira? If you're really Kira, prove it!

211
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,780
Kira? If you're really Kira, prove it!

212
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,940
Proof? Now that the notebook has fallen into other hands, committing an announced murder will no longer prove that I am Kira.

213
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,360
Proof? Now that the notebook has fallen into other hands, committing an announced murder will no longer prove that I am Kira.

214
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,500
Proof? Now that the notebook has fallen into other hands, committing an announced murder will no longer prove that I am Kira.

215
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,540
However, you should shortly receive proof that I am Kira.

216
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,300
I'm sending you my notebook.

217
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,350
W-What do you mean?!

218
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,710
W-What do you mean?!

219
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:43,520
With the notebook I'm giving you, you'll be able to see a person's name merely by looking at them. Do you understand?

220
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,280
Li-st-en care-fully...

221
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,700
Li-st-en care-fully...

222
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,960
Li-st-en care-fully...

223
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,030
Li-st-en care-fully...

224
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,900
Li-st-en care-fully...

225
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,390
On November 10th at 23:59,

226
00:09:53,390 --> 00:10:01,260
all mafia members that I've been able to identify from information taken from the FBI and other organizations will die.

227
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,900
This has already been written in the notebook, and cannot be changed.

228
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,970
I already know the location of their hideout, and I'll pass that along with the notebook.

229
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,600
In other words, that moment, the 10th of November at 23:59, will be your greatest chance to retrieve your notebook.

230
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,390
In other words, that moment, the 10th of November at 23:59, will be your greatest chance to retrieve your notebook.

231
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,160
In other words, that moment, the 10th of November at 23:59, will be your greatest chance to retrieve your notebook.

232
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,670
In other words, that moment, the 10th of November at 23:59, will be your greatest chance to retrieve your notebook.

233
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,110
What should we do?

234
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,260
If the mafia die on day X as Kira said, it would definitely be a big chance for us.

235
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,580
If the mafia die on day X as Kira said, it would definitely be a big chance for us.

236
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,570
I'm uncomfortable with following Kira's plan, but it's a good idea.

237
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,960
Exactly.

238
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,510
But, all we actually know is when the mafia will die...

239
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,490
Ide-san, you say that, but you must already have realized...

240
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,650
we're being asked to do the deal for the eyes of a Shinigami and ensure we kill them.

241
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,940
I'll do the deal.

242
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,430
N-No way! If anyone's going to do the deal, it should be me!

243
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,330
N-No way! If anyone's going to do the deal, it should be me!

244
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,620
N-No way! If anyone's going to do the deal, it should be me!

245
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,700
I was the one who handed the notebook over in the first place.

246
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,370
Because of that, I've even thought about ending my own life.

247
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,650
I'll use the notebook to kill those criminals, and then after 13 days, I'll die myself.

248
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,010
I'll use the notebook to kill those criminals, and then after 13 days, I'll die myself.

249
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,640
I'll use the notebook to kill those criminals, and then after 13 days, I'll die myself.

250
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,700
If father ends up writing the names in the notebook, then...

251
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,310
10th November 23:47

252
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,310
Everyone, are you all prepared?

253
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,030
Yes.

254
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,960
Very well. Deputy Chief Yagami, go ahead and exchange your eyes with the Shinigami.

255
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,170
Very well. Deputy Chief Yagami, go ahead and exchange your eyes with the Shinigami.

256
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,450
Very well. Deputy Chief Yagami, go ahead and exchange your eyes with the Shinigami.

257
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,510
Ryuk, do it.

258
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,540
As you wish.

259
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,700
Deputy Chief Yagami, can you see the names and lifespans of the criminals in the photos I passed you?

260
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,640
Deputy Chief Yagami, can you see the names and lifespans of the criminals in the photos I passed you?

261
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,810
Yes! I can see them.

262
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,270
When those names disappear, that's your signal.

263
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,510
Charge!!

264
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,360
Looks like Kira has gotten involved.

265
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,620
They've already gotten this far... we haven't perfected our plans yet...

266
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,060
They've already gotten this far... we haven't perfected our plans yet...

267
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,940
Damn it! Sidoh, what are you doing?!

268
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,580
Damn it! Sidoh, what are you doing?!

269
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,620
Just shut up and watch, Sidoh.

270
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,250
As long as you don't meddle in this, you'll get your notebook back.

271
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,990
Roy! Skiar!

272
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,980
The notebook is under Rodd.

273
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,190
Bring it up to the monitor room!

274
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,630
Freeze!

275
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,450
L, two of the mafia members have been captured and the notebook safely retrieved!

276
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,830
We're coming back.

277
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,800
No... it's not over.

278
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,450
No... it's not over.

279
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,960
We haven't found anyone that fits the description of Mello yet.

280
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,960
He's definitely hiding somewhere in this building.

281
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,430
We've already made it this far. We'll need to search for him slowly and calmly.

282
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,070
An explosion?!

283
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,440
Don't move. I've sealed off both exits with that one blast.

284
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,980
Don't move. I've sealed off both exits with that one blast.

285
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,460
That was merely a threat... next, I'll blow the whole hideout.

286
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,620
That was merely a threat... next, I'll blow the whole hideout.

287
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,020
Follow my orders...

288
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,830
This is Mello?

289
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,520
So, it's you again, Yagami.

290
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,010
I should have killed you the first time.

291
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,210
I never imagined I would be doing a deal for the notebook with you a second time.

292
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,270
M-I-H-A-E-L K-E-E-H-L

293

M-I-H-A-E-L K-E-E-H-L

303
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,490
Your real name is Mihael Keehl.

304
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,520
Oh, fuck.

305
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,070
How?!

306
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,870
Yes! I did it!

307
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,210
Give it up, Mello. If you come along quietly, we won't kill you.

308
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,920
Give it up, Mello. If you come along quietly, we won't kill you.

309
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,120
Give it up, Mello. If you come along quietly, we won't kill you.

310
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,620
W-Why are you saying such idiotic things?!

311
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,710
W-Why are you saying such idiotic things?!

312
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,960
Just write his name in the notebook and kill him!

313
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,300
If I write your name in this notebook, you'll die.

314
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,840
Move your hands away from the switch and raise them in the air.

315
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,030
Yagami...

316
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,500
Don't move! All I need to write now is your family name.

317
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,660
Don't move! All I need to write now is your family name.

318
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,770
It'll take less than a second.

319
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,230
Idiot! Just write it! Write it down now!!

320
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,280
Idiot! Just write it! Write it down now!!

321
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Idiot! Just write it! Write it down now!!

322
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,810
I'm sorry, I honestly never had any intention of killing you.

323
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,360
Yagami... I bet you've never killed anyone before.

324
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,210
Yagami... I bet you've never killed anyone before.

325
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,470
Gunshots?!

326
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,890
What was that?!

327
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,310
Jose! The notebook!

328
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,270
Damn you! Let go... of the notebook!!

329
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,760
You... bastard!

330
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,620
Deputy Chief!

331
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,170
Mello! Put your hands up!

332
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,520
Matsuda? Are you alright?

333
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,780
No, I'm not...

334
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,070
Well, you look alright to me.

335
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,660
L! There's no sign of Mello!

336
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,370
Shit! He got away?!

337
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,060
That's why I said to kill him sooner!

338
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,320
Father? Father?! I'm begging you! Please don't die!

339
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,500
Father? Father?! I'm begging you! Please don't die!

340
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,270
Father? Father?! I'm begging you! Please don't die!

341
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,560
Father? Father?! I'm begging you! Please don't die!

342
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,310
Light...

343
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,560
Father!!

344
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,590
I--

345
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,780
I'm so glad...

346
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,720
You're glad? Father?

347
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,450
You're glad? Father?

348
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,290
Light...

349
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,250
I still... have the eyes of a Shinigami.

350
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,740
I still... have the eyes of a Shinigami.

351
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,510
According to the Shinigami, Ryuk, I can't see the lifespan of anyone who owns a Death Note.

352
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,770
According to the Shinigami, Ryuk, I can't see the lifespan of anyone who owns a Death Note.

353
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,010
According to the Shinigami, Ryuk, I can't see the lifespan of anyone who owns a Death Note.

354
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,840
Light... you aren't Kira...

355
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,870
Light... you aren't Kira...

356
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,190
I'm so happy.

357
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,610
Of course he's not. I can't believe you're still saying things like that.

358
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,820
Father, don't speak more than necessary...

359
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,440
That's important too, but right now, there's something even more important!

360
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,700
That's important too, but right now, there's something even more important!

361
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,330
Like writing Mello's name into the notebook...

362
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,110
I-I'm sorry... in the end, I couldn't kill him.

363
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,740
I-I'm sorry... in the end, I couldn't kill him.

364
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,280
I-I'm sorry... in the end, I couldn't kill him.

365
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,630
I-I'm sorry... in the end, I couldn't kill him.

366
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,370
Would it be strange if I say "It's not too late" now?

367
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,520
No, I guess it'll depend on how I phrase it.

368
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,600
In this situation, it's not unnatural to be confused and upset.

369
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,540
Father! Use the last of your strength and write that bastards name down!

370
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,400
Father! Use the last of your strength and write that bastards name down!

371
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,630
Do you really want to go down beaten?!

372
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,700
Father?!

373
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,020
Light...

374
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,340
I'm sorry.

375
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,220
Father?!

376
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,680
Father!

377
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,350
Father!!

378
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,880
Don't die! You fool!!

379
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,800
So you're the Shinigami who came to retrieve this notebook.

380
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,340
Yes.

381
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,860
Even if it's for the sake of the Kira investigation, we only need one notebook.

382
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,750
Even if it's for the sake of the Kira investigation, we only need one notebook.

383
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,980
I'm returning this one.

384
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,450
"People who use this notebook will become unhappy", huh?

385
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,630
Well, Souichirou never actually used it, but he died believing his son wasn't Kira, so I guess he was happy.

386
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,210
Well, Souichirou never actually used it, but he died believing his son wasn't Kira, so I guess he was happy.

387
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,140
Well, Souichirou never actually used it, but he died believing his son wasn't Kira, so I guess he was happy.

388
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,510
Well, Souichirou never actually used it, but he died believing his son wasn't Kira, so I guess he was happy.

389
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
To be continued

390
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,680
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

391
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,680
This one page of everlasting depression;

392
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,270
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

393
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,270
hakanai senpou sono meni

394
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,540
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

395
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,540
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

396
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,120
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

397
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,120
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

398
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,770
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

399
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,770
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

400
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,620
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

401
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,620
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

402
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,060
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

403
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,060
Who would know of a path to salvation?

404
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,910
Menzai no waarudo

405
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,910
World of acquittal,

406
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,740
seisai no waado

407
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,740
words of retribution!

408
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,480
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

409
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,480
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

410
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,470
Redeem the game of law!

411
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,470
Aganau houritsu geemu

412
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,500
Despair the Billy,

413
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,500
Zetsubou za birii

414
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,240
iza rinri

415
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,240
here are the morals!

416
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,860
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

417
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,860
Come, relentless eraser rain.

418
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,820
Zetsubou za birii

419
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,820
Despair the Billy,

420
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,530
iza rinri

421
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,530
here are the morals!

422
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,160
Come, relentless eraser rain.

423
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,160
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

424
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,780
tomerarenai eraser rain

425
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,780
relentless eraser rain.

426
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,830
Preview

427
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,890
If Kira is caught, then Kira is Evil.

428
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,830
If Kira takes control of the world, then Kira is Justice.

429
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,830
Henceforth, things will accelerate and the world will gradually turn toward Kira.

430
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,590
Kira will definitely become Justice.

431
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,010
Next Time

432
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,010
Justice
