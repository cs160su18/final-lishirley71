00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,590
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,190
December 2007

93
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,720
What did you--?! Roger!

94
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,190
What did you--?! Roger!

95
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,110
Say that again!

96
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,610
L has died...

97
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,440
Died?!

98
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,900
Why?!

99
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,080
Was he killed by Kira?

100
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,700
Is that it?

101
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,580
Most likely.

102
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,840
After saying he was going to sentence Kira to death, he got killed himself?!

103
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,270
Is that what you're telling me?!

104
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,380
Mello...

105
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,750
Unless you win the game, or solve the puzzle... you're nothing but a loser.

106
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,660
Unless you win the game, or solve the puzzle... you're nothing but a loser.

107
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,140
Unless you win the game, or solve the puzzle... you're nothing but a loser.

108
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,580
So, who did L choose? Me or Near?

109
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,940
So, who did L choose? Me or Near?

110
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,160
He hadn't decided yet... and since he's dead, he can no longer choose.

111
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
He hadn't decided yet... and since he's dead, he can no longer choose.

112
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
He hadn't decided yet... and since he's dead, he can no longer choose.

113
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,270
Mello, Near, how about it? Why don't you two try joining forces?

114
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,550
Mello, Near, how about it? Why don't you two try joining forces?

115
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,830
Mello, Near, how about it? Why don't you two try joining forces?

116
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,250
Mello, Near, how about it? Why don't you two try joining forces?

117
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,050
Hmm, fine by me...

118
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,970
That's impossible, Roger.

119
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,930
You know that Near and I don't get along.

120
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,620
We've always been rivals...

121
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,340
Always.

122
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,200
That's fine, Roger.

123
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,570
The one who'll succeed L will be Near.

124
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,960
Unlike me, Near will handle things calmly and objectively, like he's solving a puzzle.

125
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,690
I'm leaving...

126
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,110
I'm leaving the orphanage as well.

127
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,190
Mello!

128
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,680
Besides, I'm almost 15.

129
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,310
I'm going to live my life my own way.

130
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,900
At the time of Higuchi's arrest, a policeman overheard him say:

131
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,570
March 5th 2012

132
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,950
"If you write the name of someone whose face you know in the notebook, that person will die."

133
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,530
And that's this "notebook of death"?

134
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,020
Yes. It should currently be in the possession of the Japanese police force.

135
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,540
A boy who goes by the name of "Near",

136
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,420
armed with three years' worth
of independent research into
the Kira investigation,

137
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,180
approaches the President accompanied by the Head of the FBI.

138
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,010
Mr. President, the current L is a fake created by the Japanese police force in order to avoid disorder.

139
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,480
The real L is dead.

140
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,900
Director Mason, who is this?

141
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,070
Well, let's just say he is L's true successor.

142
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,240
The United States of America...

143
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,330
established the SPK,
a brand-new counter-Kira organization
with no links to L,

144
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,330
SPK = Secret Provision for Kira

145
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:38,750
comprised of selected agents from the FBI and CIA, in addition to Near.

146
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,760
Abduction

147
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,360
However, under the present circumstances, controlling information on the Internet is impossible,

148
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,560
and the investigation into Kira has been at a standstill for far too long.

149
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,730
Those who post the names of the people they want dead on the Internet are the ones I really want them to kill!

150
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:06,740
But because Kira requires information from the Internet, there's no way they'd kill them.

151
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,080
You're completely contradicting yourself, Matsu!

152
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,530
Well, certainly, the conclusion that as long as you don't do anything bad...

153
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,630
Or rather, that for law-abiding people in general, the world has changed for the better, will be an easy conclusion for some people to reach.

154
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,680
Or rather, that for law-abiding people in general, the world has changed for the better, will be an easy conclusion for some people to reach.

155
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,460
You're a fine one to talk.

156
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,680
No, soon everyone will see it this way.

157
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,140
You're all talking about that again? Give it a rest, darling. Same with you Light.

158
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm home.

159
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,880
Welcome home!

160
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,730
Welcome home, Sayu.

161
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,530
Onii-chan, Misa-san, it's a surprise to see you two here.

162
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,720
Welcome back.

163
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,110
Please excuse our intrusion!

164
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,730
It's "Matsuda-san", right?

165
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,120
Y-Yes!

166
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
Y-Yes!

167
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,920
I haven't seen you in a while.

168
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,080
I'm indebted to you for always taking care of my dad.

169
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,880
S-Sayu-chan...

170
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,090
S-Sayu-chan...

171
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,750
Wow, you've really grown up... umm, you've become even more beautiful... erm, the last time I saw you...

172
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,240
Matsu's face has gone bright red!

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,800
No! I didn't mean--

174
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,760
I'll never let Sayu marry a police officer.

175
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,390
You're right. There's no way I would allow that.

176
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,690
Huh?! No way... I haven't even asked her out, let alone proposed!

177
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,980
Father... Mother...

178
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,110
Mo--

179
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,110
Fath--

180
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,350
Oh, but I think Matsuda-san is lovely.

181
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,660
R-Really, Sayu-chan?

182
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:37,580
Yes, and if you were maybe ten years younger, I might even have considered dating you.

183
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,710
Seems like you've learned to handle yourself.

184
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,600
Yeah, she seems so much more mature than Matsu!

185
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,970
But you haven't changed at all. You've always been this wonderful from the moment I met you!

186
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,530
Onii-chan, you've got a job too now. Don't just live together, hurry up and get married.

187
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,480
Too right!

188
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,020
Such a unfortunate family playing "happy families"... this is too funny.

189
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,300
Such a unfortunate family playing "happy families"... this is too funny.

190
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,460
What is it, Aizawa?

191
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,520
Understood.

192
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,710
Matsuda, Light. Come with me.

193
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,630
An abduction? Who's abducted who?

194
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,960
An abduction? Who's abducted who?

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,750
The Chief of the Police Force, Takimura... We have no idea who the culprit is yet.

196
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,970
The Chief of the Police Force, Takimura... We have no idea who the culprit is yet.

197
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,130
Damn it! Why now, when the Kira investigation is in this state...

198
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,170
Are you certain of this?

199
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,340
We received the call at 6:12 pm; around 45 minutes ago.

200
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,450
We've traced the call back to the Chief's cell phone.

201
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,030
Has the culprit made any demands?

202
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,310
Well... they'll exchange the Chief... for the murderer's notebook.

203
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,340
Well... they'll exchange the Chief... for the murderer's notebook.

204
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,090
Well... they'll exchange the Chief... for the murderer's notebook.

205
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,080
Who's doing this and why?!

206
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,430
Could it be Kira?

207
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,350
Not necessarily. If people found out about the notebook there would be countless people who would want it...

208
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,850
Father, how much does the Chief know about the notebook?

209
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,240
Information regarding the notebook was supposed to be kept to the people in this room.

210
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,280
That's right. I swear I haven't told the Chief anything.

211
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,870
Someone knows about the existence of the Death Note, and that the police have it... and they're coming after it.

212
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,690
Someone knows about the existence of the Death Note, and that the police have it... and they're coming after it.

213
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,650
Someone knows about the existence of the Death Note, and that the police have it... and they're coming after it.

214
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,130
Notify all police departments of the abduction only.

215
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,090
Okay!

216
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,680
Have the culprits made contact?

217
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,610
No. There's someone here to see Takimura-san.

218
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,610
What?!

219
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,150
I'm FBI agent John McEnroe.

220
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,660
It's not my real name of course, but I'm here regarding Kira, so please forgive me.

221
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:29,750
Kira... I'm afraid the Chief isn't available right now, but you can discuss the matter with me if you like.

222
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,470
I guess that's fine.

223
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,010
Let me get straight to the point... the Japanese police force can't be depended on.

224
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,520
In order to solve the Kira case, we'd like you to hand the notebook over to our country.

225
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,270
So it was the FBI!

226
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,600
Where have you hidden the Chief?!

227
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,390
W-What are you talking about?!

228
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,320
W-What are you talking about?!

229
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
Don't act as if you don't know!

230
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,630
You realize this is a serious crime?!

231
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,830
We have nothing to gain by abducting the Chief of the Japanese police force!

232
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,450
Then, how did you find out about the notebook?!

233
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,450
What's going on?

234
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,070
Seems that someone has abducted the Chief of the police force, and their aim seems to be to obtain the notebook.

235
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,500
Seems that someone has abducted the Chief of the police force, and their aim seems to be to obtain the notebook.

236
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:19,300
Commander Lester, steer the conversation toward assisting them with the rescue of the Chief and apprehending the culprit.

237
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,810
And if we get the chance, we'll seize the notebook.

238
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,060
Understood.

239
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,560
Can you hear me? This is HQ... here are your orders:

240
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,290
Has he said anything?

241
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,500
That the Japanese police backed out of the Kira investigation,

242
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:02,400
and in reality, the only ones working on the case with L were Yagami Souichirou, Mogi Kanzou and Matsuda Touta. Is that right?

243
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
and in reality, the only ones working on the case with L were Yagami Souichirou, Mogi Kanzou and Matsuda Touta. Is that right?

244
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,310
Yes. There was another man called Ukita, but he was killed...

245
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,030
So, that explains why the Chief of the Police Force didn't even know of the notebook's existence.

246
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,770
The Japanese police are useless.

247
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,120
Out of all them, the one with the highest rank was Yagami, the guy in command of headquarters, right?

248
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,790
Y-Yes.

249
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,620
Y-Yes.

250
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,170
According to my theory, there should be two notebooks.

251
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,010
Kira has one, and the Japanese police has one.

252
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,340
We'll take them both!

253
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,380
As long as we do as Mello says, nothing will go wrong.

254
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,350
In the year and a half Mello's been here, has he been wrong about anything?

255
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:58,170
But why would someone like you, who joined us by bringing the head of a mafia boss that even Kira hadn't managed to kill,

256
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,360
be so hung up over a notebook?

257
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,330
I don't just want the notebook...

258
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,620
I'll kill anyone who gets in my way, and become number one!

259
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,610
I'll kill anyone who gets in my way, and become number one!

260
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,380
I'll do whatever it takes to beat Near to it.

261
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,360
Boss!

262
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,420
What is it? Keep it down.

263
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,660
S-Sorry... Eddie and I were kinda dozing off and...

264
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,960
Takimura has managed to kill himself using his necktie.

265
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,420
You idiot! This won't work without a hostage!

266
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,480
No... it's alright.

267
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:19,060
If this is Kira's work, it means they don't know our names or faces, so they killed Takimura instead.

268
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,120
In short, Kira is someone who knows about this abduction.

269
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,870
What should we do, Mello?

270
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,810
Next up, we'll abduct Yagami Souichirou's daughter, Yagami Sayu!

271
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,190
There are no clues regarding the whereabouts of the Chief...

272
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,180
The culprits haven't made further contact since abducting him. What does this mean?

273
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,210
Light. That FBI agent called himself "John McEnroe"... His real name is Rally Connors, there's no doubt about it.

274
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,550
Light. That FBI agent called himself "John McEnroe"... His real name is Rally Connors, there's no doubt about it.

275
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,610
Light. That FBI agent called himself "John McEnroe"... His real name is Rally Connors, there's no doubt about it.

276
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,620
Really? Good.

277
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,270
Really? Good.

278
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,440
The investigation is real too.

279
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:07,910
The Head of the FBI himself offered his assistance in rescuing the Chief... I guess we can trust him.

280
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,250
The Head of the FBI himself offered his assistance in rescuing the Chief... I guess we can trust him.

281
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,240
The Chief should already be dead... why haven't they said anything?

282
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,600
The Chief should already be dead... why haven't they said anything?

283
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,700
He's dead, so they're just giving up the exchange? Is that the kind of opponent they are?

284
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,100
He's dead, so they're just giving up the exchange? Is that the kind of opponent they are?

285
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,380
Father... no, everyone else that's here too. You all need to be careful.

286
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,760
Even if the Chief doesn't know about the notebook, he knows who was investigating alongside L.

287
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,840
If he reveals that, there is a chance that they'll come after us--

288
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,060
Light!

289
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,730
I'll go to bed by myself tonight, like a good girl.

290
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,480
Yeah, goodnight.

291
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,640
Goodnight!

292
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,530
I'll stay here.

293
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,720
The people here aren't the only ones in danger! Our families and--

294
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,700
The people here aren't the only ones in danger! Our families and--

295
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,160
The Chief's cell phone number... it's from the culprits!

296
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,210
Aizawa!

297
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,070
Yes!

298
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,790
Trace the call!

299
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,880
This is Yagami.

300
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,830
Deputy Chief... about the deal regarding the exchange of the Chief for the notebook... that's now off.

301
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,820
Deputy Chief... about the deal regarding the exchange of the Chief for the notebook... that's now off.

302
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,480
Deputy Chief... about the deal regarding the exchange of the Chief for the notebook... that's now off.

303
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,070
Takimura is dead.

304
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,910
What?! Y-You bastard!

305
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,890
What?! Y-You bastard!

306
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,620
What?! Y-You bastard!

307
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,570
The deal is only off as far as the Chief is concerned. Instead, we'll now exchange the notebook in return for Yagami Sayu.

308
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,850
The deal is only off as far as the Chief is concerned. Instead, we'll now exchange the notebook in return for Yagami Sayu.

309
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:33,980
As the Deputy Chief of the Police, we know it's pointless to tell you not to contact the police, but we would like you to act alone.

310
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,000
If we see any big movements by the police, we'll kill your daughter, without hesitation.

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,290
Just as we did with the Chief.

312
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,070
I'll be sending you images of Takimura's corpse. Take a good look.

313
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,130
I'll contact you again tomorrow.

314
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,800
H-Hey!

315
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,410
H-Hey!

316
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,790
They got me! They've manipulated Takimura's death to their own advantage, and now Sayu is...

317
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,270
They got me! They've manipulated Takimura's death to their own advantage, and now Sayu is...

318
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,980
Light, things are getting interesting again, eh?

319
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,670
The Chief...

320
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,040
Why did they have to go this far?!

321
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,820
Damn it!

322
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,590
Yes, yes...

323
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,970
Darling? Isn't this rather unusual of you? Calling from your work cell phone...

324
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,970
Huh? Sayu?

325
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,250
Now that you mention it, she's pretty late.

326
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,510
Sayu...

327
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,480
Are you okay, Father?

328
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,930
The way I figure it, the kidnappers didn't kill the Chief; Kira did.

329
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,820
Huh?!

330
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,650
They probably did that to prevent the kidnappers from acquiring the notebook.

331
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,900
Kira prefers to think of themselves as just, so they wouldn't want the notebook falling into evil hands.

332
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:55,350
If Kira did kill the Chief, then we've got to assume that they have some way of accessing police information.

333
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,770
We're better off if we act by using only the people here. If we don't...

334
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,830
We're better off if we act by using only the people here. If we don't...

335
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,290
Kira may try and kill the hostage again.

336
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,350
That's correct.

337
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:19,430
Near, the abducted Chief of the Japanese police has been killed.

338
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,360
By whom?

339
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,300
By whom? By the people that abducted him.

340
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,590
By whom? By the people that abducted him.

341
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,270
It would be interesting if it turns out that Kira was the one who killed him.

342
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:33,350
You're right. If the hostage dies, then they'd be unable to exchange him for the notebook.

343
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,930
And if it was Kira, it narrows the list of suspects.

344
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,200
And if it was Kira, it narrows the list of suspects.

345
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,000
By the way, Commander Lester, any news on his whereabouts?

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,640
Well, it's certain that four years ago he was at the orphanage you mentioned... after that, we have no idea.

347
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,160
Well, it's certain that four years ago he was at the orphanage you mentioned... after that, we have no idea.

348
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,310
Well, it's certain that four years ago he was at the orphanage you mentioned... after that, we have no idea.

349
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,200
So, it's decided.

350
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,840
Mello, you always get too emotional and neglect what's really important.

351
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,650
Or do you really have nothing to do with this?

352
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,020
It's strange that you'd leave a photo of yourself behind...

353
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,230
This is Yagami.

354
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,670
Your daughter has finally arrived here.

355
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,780
"Here"?

356
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,950
You must have an idea as to where we are by now.

357
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,130
We'll do the exchange here.

358
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,020
Alone. With the notebook. Within two days. In LA.

359
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,110
Alone. With the notebook. Within two days. In LA.

360
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,280
Alone. With the notebook. Within two days. In LA.

361
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,390
Alone. With the notebook. Within two days. In LA.

362
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,540
There will be no exchange unless you guarantee that my daughter is safe!

363
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,800
Let me hear her voice.

364
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,490
I get it, I get it. I'll mail you a picture of her.

365
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,140
Sayu...

366
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,480
Deputy Chief! We've narrowed it down to Los Angeles' Fifth Avenue.

367
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,900
The TV program pictured in the background is currently airing in the US.

368
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,250
They've taken it on purpose to let us know she's okay.

369
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,270
T-Thank god... at least we know she's alive.

370
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,970
T-Thank god... at least we know she's alive.

371
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,310
T-Thank god... at least we know she's alive.

372
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,660
I'm going to take the notebook to LA.

373
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,430
I'm going as the Deputy Chief of the Police Force, and also as Yagami Sayu's father!

374
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,370
I'll make all the decisions and accept full responsibility for them!

375
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,720
Father! Wait until we've worked out a plan.

376
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,310
He's right, Deputy Chief.

377
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,190
But I've got to get to LA within two days. There's no time.

378
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,460
So, you're saying that the kidnappers didn't kill Takimura; Kira did?!

379
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,780
I'm just mentioning it as a possibility.

380
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,000
And if that's true, Kira somehow managed to obtain information from the Japanese police.

381
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,090
Yes?

382
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,500
This is L...

383
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,720
It's L... the current one.

384
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,630
It's L... the current one.

385
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,520
I've heard what John McEnroe, or Agent Rally Connors, had to say from Deputy Chief Yagami.

386
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,580
I've heard what John McEnroe, or Agent Rally Connors, had to say from Deputy Chief Yagami.

387
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,850
I've heard what John McEnroe, or Agent Rally Connors, had to say from Deputy Chief Yagami.

388
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,940
Will you assist us in the investigation into the murder of Chief Takimura?

389
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,940
Let's see...

390
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,860
The phone...

391
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,780
Second-generation L... it's a pleasure to meet you.

392
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,820
Second-generation L... it's a pleasure to meet you.

393
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,260
"Second-generation"? What are you talking about?

394
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,340
"Second-generation"? What are you talking about?

395
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,250
Who are you?

396
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,130
There's no point in hiding it.

397
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:45,220
We're a newly established organization especially created to investigate Kira independently of L, called the SPK.

398
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,560
The seven main members of this organization all know about L's death.

399
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,120
L's death? Who and where?!

400
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,850
L's death? Who and where?!

401
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,180
And I am the one at the center of the SPK...

402
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,200
Let me see... I'm N.

403
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,110
Let me see... I'm N.

404
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,700
"N"? Is this a joke?

405
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,660
"N"? Is this a joke?

406
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,210
And yet... this feeling... what is it?

407
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,200
And yet... this feeling... what is it?

408
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,450
And yet... this feeling... what is it?

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

410
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,420
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

411
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,420
This one page of everlasting depression;

412
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,010
hakanai senpou sono meni

413
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,010
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

414
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,280
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

415
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,280
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

416
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,860
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

417
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,860
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

418
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,510
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

419
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,510
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

420
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,360
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

421
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,360
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

422
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,800
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

423
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,800
Who would know of a path to salvation?

424
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,650
Menzai no waarudo

425
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,650
World of acquittal,

426
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,480
seisai no waado

427
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,480
words of retribution!

428
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,220
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

429
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,220
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

430
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,210
Redeem the game of law!

431
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,210
Aganau houritsu geemu

432
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,240

Come, relentless eraser rain.

438
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,560
Zetsubou za birii

439
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,560

00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,270

Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

443
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,900
Come, relentless eraser rain.

444
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,520
relentless eraser rain.

445
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,520
tomerarenai eraser rain

446
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,080
Preview

447
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,590
Damn it! What the hell is going on?!

448
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,080
I checked all the crew members on the flights leaving today in advance, but there wasn't anyone suspicious!

449
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,990
I can still make it!

450
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,290
Now that it's come to this, is killing them my only choice?

451
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,000
Sayu...

452
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,920
Next Time

453
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,920
Impatience
