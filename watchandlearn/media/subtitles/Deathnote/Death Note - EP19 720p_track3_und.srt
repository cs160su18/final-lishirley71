00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,440
Matsuda! This isn't child's play! Don't be flippant!

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,800
Matsuda! This isn't child's play! Don't be flippant!

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,000
Matsuda! This isn't child's play! Don't be flippant!

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,850
Understood...

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,000
This is about the Kira investigation! Will you take it seriously?!

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,350
This is about the Kira investigation! Will you take it seriously?!

22
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,360
S-Sorry...

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,910
Matsuda!!

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,520
I mean, Matsuda-san, please stop.

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,070
"Matsuda"?

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,360
I don't want to be a dead weight around here.

27
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,670
R-Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do? Other than being a manager?

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,560
R-Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do? Other than being a manager?

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,080
R-Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do? Other than being a manager?

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,370
R-Ryuuzaki, is there anything else I can do? Other than being a manager?

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,500
Then, can you bring me another cup of coffee?

32
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,070
I too... want to play a bigger role in this!

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,000
I too... want to play a bigger role in this!

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,130
Matsuda

35
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,110
I love you...

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,580
So, please, don't tell me that you're leaving.

37
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,240
So, please, don't tell me that you're leaving.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,000
I want to be by your side forever.

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,780
Director!

40
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,440
Please, Misa has a boyfriend, so love scenes are no good!

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,550
Huh?! W-Wait...

42
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,150
What are you saying all of a sudden?!

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,890
We can just pretend to kiss.

44
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,240
If you say things like that, we'll never get this movie finished!

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,550
I said no, and I mean no!

46
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,340
The Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters.

47
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,340
Today is Friday!

48
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,710
All the deaths which benefit Yotsuba happen towards the end of the week.

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,350
I don't want to be a dead weight around here.

50
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,990
There was always something amazing about Mogi-san.

51
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,810
Matsuda! This isn't child's play!

52
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,940
Matsuda! This isn't child's play!

53
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,250
Will you take it seriously?!

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,790
Well, Matsuda-san is a bit of an airhead by nature.

55
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,660
Bring me another cup of coffee.

56
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,940
Matsuda!!

57
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,930
Misa's pet name for Matsuda is Matsu.

58
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,090
Matsu! Hey, Matsu!!

59
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,930
Matsu! Hey, Matsu!!

60
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,810
He seems to have gone off somewhere.

61
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,790
Huh?!

62
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,050
In that case, let's try starting with the names on this list.

63
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,200
In that case, let's try starting with the names on this list.

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,180
Understood.

65
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,900
If it was possible to kill someone by merely knowing their name and face, would I try to kill criminals?

66
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,200
If it was possible to kill someone by merely knowing their name and face, would I try to kill criminals?

67
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,670
I do believe there are people in this world that are better off dead...

68
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,670
but I wouldn't take it upon myself and become a murderer to make the world a better place.

69
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,830
No, I'm thinking about this too much.

70
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,120
There's no way I'd forget about killing so many people--

71
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,680
What's the matter?

72
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,390
Why are you staring at me?

73
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,800
Are you annoyed that I'm the only one with cake to eat?

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
No, it's nothing like that.

75
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,490
Here.

76
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,740
I'm not envious.

77
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,350
Ryuuzaki.

78
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,770
What's up, Watari?

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,530
The detective Erald Coil has been commissioned to "reveal L's identity".

80
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,190
Erald Coil, the famous detective said to be second only to L.

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,580
Who would commission this?

82
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:38,590
We've determined that the commission came from Kida Masahiko, the Planning Director of the Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters.

83
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,710
So, it is Yotsuba's work!

84
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,080
Yotsuba has got to be working with Kira.

85
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,540
They want L's identity, so that they can kill L.

86
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,680
They want L's identity, so that they can kill L.

87
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,430
This is bad. We're already understaffed, and now we have this Coil to worry about.

88
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,430
This is bad. We're already understaffed, and now we have this Coil to worry about.

89
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,000
It's fine.

90
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,440
The detective known as Erald Coil is me.

91
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,990
The three most famous detectives in this world at the moment... L, Coil and Deneuve... are all me.

92
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,390
The three most famous detectives in this world at the moment... L, Coil and Deneuve... are all me.

93
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,870
The three most famous detectives in this world at the moment... L, Coil and Deneuve... are all me.

94
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,160
The three most famous detectives in this world at the moment... L, Coil and Deneuve... are all me.

95
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,270
The three most famous detectives in this world at the moment... L, Coil and Deneuve... are all me.

96
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,240
A lot of people who try to find me fall for this.

97
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,810
If you keep this secret, this strawberry is yours.

98
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,680
If you keep this secret, this strawberry is yours.

99
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,760
Impressive as always, Ryuuzaki.

100
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,210
It might be better to try and blend in and get out of here.

101
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:38,920
No! Then me coming here would mean nothing.

102
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,130
No! Then me coming here would mean nothing.

103
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,500
Should I wait for everyone to go before searching the building?

104
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,740
But what if I get caught?

105
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,660
Maybe it's better if I leave...

106
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,300
Jeez, tonight again? I'm really not in the mood for this...

107
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,990
Jeez, tonight again? I'm really not in the mood for this...

108
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,630
At least it's the weekend; if we had these drawn out secret meetings on a Monday, it'd be hard for me to bring myself to work.

109
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,540
At least it's the weekend; if we had these drawn out secret meetings on a Monday, it'd be hard for me to bring myself to work.

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,810
Secret meetings?!

111
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,710
Bingo!

112
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,850
The nineteenth floor.

113
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,020
I've come this far...

114
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,900
I'm going to do this!

115
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,660
Okay, I've got to get close to this guy? Leave it to me.

116
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,760
Okay, I've got to get close to this guy? Leave it to me.

117
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,820
Okay, I've got to get close to this guy? Leave it to me.

118
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,450
So, you want me to hack the surveillance cameras and security system at Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters?

119
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:36,990
So, you want me to hack the surveillance cameras and security system at Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters?

120
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,580
Yes.

121
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,540
It's safe to assume that there's definitely a connection between Kira and the Yotsuba Group.

122
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,770
First, we need to investigate Yotsuba, and determine exactly who, and how many, have this power.

123
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,160
First, we need to investigate Yotsuba, and determine exactly who, and how many, have this power.

124
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,000
First, we need to investigate Yotsuba, and determine exactly who, and how many, have this power.

125
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,460
Most importantly, we must ensure that the Yotsuba Group doesn't discover that we're investigating them.

126
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,990
Just consider that if you're caught, our chance of catching Kira will disappear then and there.

127
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,490
Damn it, I can't hear this clearly...

128
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,020
If I could just overhear one important thing...

129
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,590
He's just in our way... we should kill him and let our share prices rise...

130
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,000
They just said "kill"!

131
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,670
Kira-sama is really...

132
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,510
"Kira"?! They said "Kira"! They said it!

133
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,470
"Kira"?! They said "Kira"! They said it!

134
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,400
"Kira"?! They said "Kira"! They said it!

135
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,750
They're getting Kira to kill someone?

136
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,140
Yes! I heard it!!

137
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,370
They're definitely connected to Kira. I did it! What an achievement!!

138
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,570
They're definitely connected to Kira. I did it! What an achievement!!

139
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,020
Who the hell are you?!

140
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,420
Please, think ahead carefully before you act, and don't do anything rash.

141
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,400
Please, think ahead carefully before you act, and don't do anything rash.

142
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,390
Ryuuzaki.

143
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,900
What is it, Watari?

144
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,980
We've received a distress signal from Matsuda-san's belt.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,190
Where from?

146
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,840
Well, it seems to be originating from Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters.

147
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,030
Well, it seems to be originating from Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters.

148
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,950
I-I'm Matsui Tarou, a manager at Yoshida Productions.

149
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:42,330
How would you like to hire our number one recommended, multi-talented star, Amane Misa, for your commercials?

150
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,830
Please, just forget everything I've just said.

151
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,550
We need to rethink our plan.

152
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,860
Matsuda, you idiot...

153
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,400
Yoshida Productions... Matsui Tarou...

154
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,560
Yoshida Productions... Matsui Tarou...

155
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,520
He doesn't seem to have anything suspicious on him.

156
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,080
I doubt he's an industrial spy.

157
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,450
Yes... erm, I hope you will consider Misa-Misa...

158
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,550
These two are most likely keeping an eye on me, while the rest of them are in the meeting room, deciding how to dispose of me.

159
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,200
I'm as good as dead...

160
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,510
I wonder if they've received my distress signal?

161
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,320
I wonder if Ryuuzaki will bother to try and save me?

162
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,680
I wonder what's going to happen to me...

163
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,720
It's alright, you can answer that.

164
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,870
Just don't mention that you're here.

165
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,010
Also, hold the phone away from your ear so that we can listen in.

166
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:53,940
O-Okay.

167
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,690
O-Okay.

168
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,910
Hello?

169
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,740
Yo, Matsui!

170
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,330
Ryuuzaki!!

171
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,550
It's Asahi, long time no talk.

172
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,960
Hey, Asahi, how's it going?

173
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,690
Doesn't sound like you're outside... you at home?

174
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,000
Doesn't sound like you're outside... you at home?

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,050
Err, yeah...

176
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,760
You alone?

177
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,760
Yeah, I'm alone. What's up?

178
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,190
He's not with Amane Misa, Matsuda is alone.

179
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,480
He's not with Amane Misa, Matsuda is alone.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,010
Fancy going out for a drink?

181
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,140
What? Now? Sorry, not tonight...

182
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,630
What? Now? Sorry, not tonight...

183
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,710
What, don't tell me your finances are in a pinch again?

184
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,640
"Pinch"?

185
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,450
Yeah, they're in quite a "pinch" at the moment. You got me!

186
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,460
Matsuda is in quite a pinch.

187
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,500
Never mind, another time then. See ya.

188
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,010
Never mind, another time then. See ya.

189
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,940
S-So, what do you think of Misa-Misa? I'm sure she'll be an asset to your company.

190
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,510
S-So, what do you think of Misa-Misa? I'm sure she'll be an asset to your company.

191
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,970
If you're serious about promoting her, shouldn't you have brought her here?

192
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,300
Are you really her manager?

193
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,730
Well, she's currently shooting a movie nearby, I'll call her over as soon as she's done.

194
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,030
Please consider using Misa-Misa as your image in your commercials.

195
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,720
For now, I've got to keep stalling!

196
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,870
Misa's phone is going straight to the answering machine.

197
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,010
I'll send a message telling her to call us.

198
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,500
What should we do, Ryuuzaki?

199
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,470
Let's see, if Matsuda-san dies now, it'll confirm the Yotsuba Group's guilt.

200
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,980
Let's see, if Matsuda-san dies now, it'll confirm the Yotsuba Group's guilt.

201
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,380
For the moment, let's just see what unfolds.

202
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,760
What shall we do?

203
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,680
It all depends on whether or not he overheard our discussion.

204
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,260
The possibility's there. There's no other choice than to kill him.

205
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,730
The possibility's there. There's no other choice than to kill him.

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,630
But is he really here merely to promote a "talent"? Surely he's not from the police?

207
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,560
But is he really here merely to promote a "talent"? Surely he's not from the police?

208
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,730
That's impossible. The Japanese police should have abandoned the Kira investigation by now.

209
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,120
That's impossible. The Japanese police should have abandoned the Kira investigation by now.

210
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,440
It doesn't matter who he is, we've got to kill him.

211
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,120
It doesn't matter who he is, we've got to kill him.

212
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,780
It's true that she might actually be a good image for us.

213
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,420
Don't you agree?!

214
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,820
Her shoot should finish soon, so please wait.

215
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,070
Her shoot should finish soon, so please wait.

216
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,970
Jeez, I'm so tired...

217
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,270
Yay, a message from Light.

218
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,600
He must be worried about me, since it's so late.

219
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,450
Misa.

220
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,330
Light! I'm sorry, but I've been working all this time. I'm done now!

221
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,660
Misa, you're not with Matsuda-san then?

222
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,700
Misa, you're not with Matsuda-san then?

223
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,580
He's such a disgrace. He just abandoned Misa!

224
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,480
My work cell phone is ringing...

225
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,630
Huh? It's Matsu.

226
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,090
Matsuda-san is calling Misa.

227
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,130
Ask Misa-san to enable us to hear.

228
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,610
Misa-Misa, as soon as filming finishes, I need you to head over to the Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters.

229
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,890
Misa-Misa, as soon as filming finishes, I need you to head over to the Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters.

230
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,860
You could get the chance to appear in their commercials.

231
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,360
Currently, I'm in the middle of negotiating a deal for you.

232
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,190
Oh, really?! That's amazing, Matsu! So that's what you were doing!

233
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,490
Misa will give it everything she got!

234
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,260
Okay, take a taxi, and you'll be here in no time.

235
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,200
Okay, take a taxi, and you'll be here in no time.

236
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,410
Yagami-kun, we may be able to save Matsuda-san, but we will need Misa-san's help.

237
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,380
Yagami-kun, we may be able to save Matsuda-san, but we will need Misa-san's help.

238
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,030
Yagami-kun, we may be able to save Matsuda-san, but we will need Misa-san's help.

239
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,920
She'll listen to you.

240
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,590
Hi, I'm Misa-Misa!

241
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,720
Misa doesn't do nudes, but underwear or swimsuits are fine!

242
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,010
Pleased to meet you!

243
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,790
Hmm, she's ridiculously cute in the flesh...

244
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,400
Hmm, she's ridiculously cute in the flesh...

245
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,480
Surely that's not the issue right now...

246
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,840
Matsu, the production company gave the go-ahead for a special reception especially for Yotsuba-san.

247
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,830
Matsu, the production company gave the go-ahead for a special reception especially for Yotsuba-san.

248
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,730
Huh? Special?

249
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,320
Huh? Special?

250
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,720
Good evening! Pleased to meet you!

251
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,790
Good evening! Pleased to meet you!

252
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,500
Tonight, the girls from our production team would like to provide you all with a special reception!

253
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,770
Oi, I think we're starting to go off on a tangent here...

254
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,940
Oi, I think we're starting to go off on a tangent here...

255
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,730
It can't be helped; for now, we've got to stay close to that manager.

256
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,370
It can't be helped; for now, we've got to stay close to that manager.

257
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,560
So, we may as well enjoy ourselves.

258
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,300
Ryuuzaki and the others should be able to see us in here.

259
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,450
We might be saved.

260
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,980
Okay, drink up! Drink up!

261
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,530
This has got to be heaven!

262
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,860
Misa-san... she's not bad at this, is she?

263
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,530
Misa-san... she's not bad at this, is she?

264
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,250
Okay then...

265
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,730
I'm just going to the toilet.

266
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,020
Ryuuzaki, can you see me?

267
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,850
Ryuuzaki, can you see me?

268
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:16,860
Yes.

269
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,990
I'm sorry, I--

270
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,440
Never mind about that now.

271
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,740
Right. The eight that are here were in a meeting together, planning who to have Kira murder.

272
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,030
Right. The eight that are here were in a meeting together, planning who to have Kira murder.

273
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,610
Right. The eight that are here were in a meeting together, planning who to have Kira murder.

274
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,230
I heard them clearly.

275
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,110
Without a doubt, it's them.

276
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,260
Are you absolutely sure?

277
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,830
If it's true, they'll be aiming to kill you.

278
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,690
I thought as much. Is there really no way to save me?

279
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,790
I thought as much. Is there really no way to save me?

280
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,230
Luckily, you're still alive, so there's a chance that we can save you.

281
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,240
But to do that... you've got to die before you're killed.

282
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,470
But to do that... you've got to die before you're killed.

283
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,230
Huh?!

284
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,850
Understand? Listen carefully...

285
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,220
Understand? Listen carefully...

286
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,750
What?!

287
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,010
No way...

288
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,320
That's stupid...

289
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,000
Say, Nagano-san...

290
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,000
In other words...

291
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,110
Really?!

292
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,340
Our company is still expanding...

293
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,160
Oh, I agree...

294
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,160
What's going on?!

295
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,250
Man, I'm so drunk...

296
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,340
I feel so good!

297
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,840
Hey, everyone! Are you all having fun? You should be!

298
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,930
Hey, everyone! Are you all having fun? You should be!

299
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,100
Hey, everyone! Are you all having fun? You should be!

300
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,210
Now everyone, this is what you've all been waiting for! It's Matsui Tarou Showtime!

301
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,370
Now everyone, this is what you've all been waiting for! It's Matsui Tarou Showtime!

302
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,650
Now everyone, this is what you've all been waiting for! It's Matsui Tarou Showtime!

303
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,480
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?

304
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,860
Yay! Go for it, Matsui-san!

305
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,010
Woo-aah!

306
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,170
Hey! That's dangerous! You're drunk!

307
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,960
It's fine, I do this all the time...

308
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,950
Cut it out!

309
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,760
That's dangerous, you idiot!!

310
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,010
I'm... fine...

311
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,370
H-He fell!!

312
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,620
This is bad...

313
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,640
Oh, no! I heard a huge bang and came out to see what happened...

314
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,640
119! 119!

315
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,640
119 is the emergency telephone number in Japan

316
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,640
God... what an awful role to play...

317
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,110
Leave this to us, gentlemen. Hurry up and get out of here!

318
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,470
Y-You sure?

319
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,890
We'll be fine. Please, keep me in mind for the commercial.

320
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,380
We'll be fine. Please, keep me in mind for the commercial.

321
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,370
Hurry! If the paparazzi catch us, it'll be troublesome.

322
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,600
Hurry! If the paparazzi catch us, it'll be troublesome.

323
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,860
What, what's going on?! A jumper?!

324
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, at least he died in front of us.

325
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,980
I know we're understaffed, but I can't believe I got dragged into this.

326
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,640
Matsuda, you idiot...

327
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,660
Amane Misa's manager, dead...

328
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,630
Yes?

329
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,410
Is this the Planning Director at Yotsuba Group's Tokyo Headquarters, Kida Masahiko?

330
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,050
Ah, that is correct. Who is this?

331
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,920
Ah, that is correct. Who is this?

332
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,880
The name's Erald Coil.

333
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,010
I'd like your advice on a certain issue.

334
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,520
An advance of $2 million, and $8 million for a successful completion? Is he serious?!

335
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,790
An advance of $2 million, and $8 million for a successful completion? Is he serious?!

336
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,310
An advance of $2 million, and $8 million for a successful completion? Is he serious?!

337
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:26,980
On top of that, he's demanded $2 million for his silence if we don't go ahead with it.

338
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,810
Buying his silence, huh? It's best to assume that he already knows something.

339
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,460
Buying his silence, huh? It's best to assume that he already knows something.

340
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,980
This is getting too dangerous! I want out.

341
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,030
This is getting too dangerous! I want out.

342
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,720
I've got no clue to which one of you is Kira, but I don't want to get too deep in this and end up being arrested!

343
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,880
I've got no clue to which one of you is Kira, but I don't want to get too deep in this and end up being arrested!

344
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,930
Hatori... you're going to be dead tomorrow.

345
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,960
Hatori... you're going to be dead tomorrow.

346
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,000
Wait, that was just a joke!

347
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,250
I'm in! I'll do this properly!

348
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,080
So, what're we gonna do? Even if Coil knows something, he's still willing to take it on.

349
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,520
So, what're we gonna do? Even if Coil knows something, he's still willing to take it on.

350
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,140
As long as we give him the money, he's on our side. That's all there is to it.

351
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,360
As long as we give him the money, he's on our side. That's all there is to it.

352
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,480
We've got to keep a shrewd guy like him on our side.

353
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,230
You're right; it doesn't matter how much we've got to pay.

354
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,210
Yeah, that's right! Buy him off!

355
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,160
Okay, this contract with Coil, any objections?

356
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,640
Okay, this contract with Coil, any objections?

357
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,000
No objections.

358
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,530
L, you listening?

359
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,530
What a disappointment. The security levels here are terrible.

360
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,340
What a disappointment. The security levels here are terrible.

361
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,120
All they've got is a contract with some security firm... not even any measures to detect bugging devices.

362
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,450
All they've got is a contract with some security firm... not even any measures to detect bugging devices.

363
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,630
I-It's been a week since I infiltrated that place.

364
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,350
I-It's been a week since I infiltrated that place.

365
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,310
Somehow everything seems to be going brilliantly!

366
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,810
It's time...

367
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,920
Someone out of this lot is... Kira.

368
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,040
Someone out of this lot is... Kira.

369
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,990
In that case, let's begin the meeting.

370
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,580
But there's only seven of them, instead of eight...

371
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

372
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,320
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

373
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,320
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

374
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,450
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

375
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,450
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

376
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:39,230
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

377
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:39,230
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

378
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,010
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

379
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,010
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

380
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:51,080
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

381
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:51,080
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

382
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,220
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

383
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,220
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

384
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,870
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

385
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,870
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

386
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,030
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

387
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,030
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

388
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,510
I'm not so weak,

389
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,510
Samazama na negative ni

390
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,840
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

391
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,840
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

392
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,700
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

393
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,700
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

394
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,450
Preview

395
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,860
Ryuuzaki! do you truly believe that after catching the current Kira, I'd go on to become Kira... A murderer?

396
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,580
Ryuuzaki! do you truly believe that after catching the current Kira, I'd go on to become Kira... A murderer?

397
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,140
Ryuuzaki... do you truly believe that after catching the current Kira, I'd go on to become Kira... A murderer?

398
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,000
Do you really see me as that kind of human being?!

399
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,760
Next Time

400
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,760
Makeshift
