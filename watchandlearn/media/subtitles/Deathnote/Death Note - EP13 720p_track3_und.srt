00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,020
Confessions

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,280
Light!

18
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,580
The second Kira has sent Sakura TV another message for Kira.

19
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,220
This time they've sent a video and a diary.

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,400
I thought that I'd better let you know...

21
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,890
A diary?

22
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,250
I bet that idiot's gone and done something stupid again.

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,410
Can't they just sit still and wait?!

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,250
They're saying to show the diary on TV?

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,050
Yes, this is it.

26
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,710
10th: Got invited to a party by friends but turned it down.
Yokohama is too far.

27
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,130
1st: Even though I said I wasn't going to attend the circle activities
with GW High, my friends still rang and asked me to go.

28
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,710
7th: School started, but I'd divided the notebooks for different classes with my friends, so I didn't attend.

29
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,710
5th: Last day of the holiday, but I just lazed around at home.

30
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,710
4th: Went to see "Morning Musume" with my friend
at the Saitama Super Arena.

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,630
May 2006

32
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,960
2006? Last year's diary, huh?

33
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,710
13th: A friend came to borrow a CD that I'd
promised to lend them.

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,710
16th: Forgot about a report that was due. Asked a friend to come over in order to copy theirs.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,350
2006? Last year's diary, huh?

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,710
19th: Read "Jump" for the first time in ages.
Reading it all in one go was fun.

37
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,760
22nd: Met up with a friend in Aoyama.
Looked at each other's notebooks.

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,680
Look at the entry under the 30th.

39
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,140
28th: Apparently they are going to release the PZ3, which will be more amazing than the PZ2. One to watch!

40
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,140
30th: Confirmed that there was a Shinigami present at the Giant's match in the Tokyo Dome.

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,140
Confirmed that there was a Shinigami present in the Tokyo Dome.

42
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,990
I can only imagine that they're suggesting that we do this on the 30th of May.

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,230
If this goes out on TV, even the public will realize their intentions...

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,800
In any case, the only way you can see a Shinigami is if you touch their Death Note.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,610
In any case, the only way you can see a Shinigami is if you touch their Death Note.

46
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,900
How do they--?

47
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,740
22nd: Met up with a friend in Aoyama.
Looked at each other's notebooks.

48
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,560
Hey, Rem?

49
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,540
Huh?

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,490
Even though I have the eyes of a Shinigami, I'm unable to see my own lifespan. Can you explain why that is again?

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,290
Amane Misa

52
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,290
Even though I have the eyes of a Shinigami, I'm unable to see my own lifespan. Can you explain why that is again?

53
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,720
Humans possessing a Death Note need only see the lifespans of the humans they are going to kill.

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:47,520
Shinigami are unable to see each other's lifespans, and the same principle applies to humans who have Death Notes.

55
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,630
22nd of May... at Aoyama, we looked at each other's notebooks.

56
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,110
22nd of May... at Aoyama, we looked at each other's notebooks.

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,730
If by "notebooks", they mean "Death Notes", then... that's something that only I, as Kira, would understand.

58
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,780
If by "notebooks", they mean "Death Notes", then... that's something that only I, as Kira, would understand.

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,920
The police should be focusing on the entry for the 30th of May...

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,160
"Confirmed that there was a Shinigami present at the Giant's match in the Tokyo Dome".

61
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm probably correct in assuming that the entry regarding Aoyama is the real message.

62
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,500
But in that case...

63
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,420
What do you make of it, Light-kun?

64
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,390
I'd better be careful not to say anything careless here...

65
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,000
It's best that I let him go first.

66
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,630
Right now, it just looks pretty stupid to me.

67
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,560
Right now, it just looks pretty stupid to me.

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,350
Yeah! It's obvious that they're attempting to meet up with Kira at the Giants's game.

69
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,570
Yeah! It's obvious that they're attempting to meet up with Kira at the Giants's game.

70
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,990
Broadcasting this will cause a panic, and the game will be cancelled... don't they even realize this?

71
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:50,990
If I'm honest... this is so dumb, I'm not quite sure how to deal with it.

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,620
If we broadcast this diary, we'd also have to make the announcement that the match on the 30th will be cancelled.

73
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,000
If we broadcast this diary, we'd also have to make the announcement that the match on the 30th will be cancelled.

74
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,300
Yet, if we don't broadcast the diary, the second Kira won't make their move.

75
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,440
Plus, if we cancel the game, they may get angry, and who knows what they'll do...

76
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,320
It'll be okay. The second Kira appears to worship Kira.

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,680
It'll be okay. The second Kira appears to worship Kira.

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,380
We should be fine in believing their promise to our fake Kira that they won't take innocent lives.

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,070
Anyhow, first of all, we need to broadcast this diary and announce that the game is cancelled.

80
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,540
Then we'll announce that on the 30th, all the roads surrounding the Tokyo Dome will be controlled by us.

81
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,450
Then we'll announce that on the 30th, all the roads surrounding the Tokyo Dome will be controlled by us.

82
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
Lastly, we'll send a reply from our fake Kira, agreeing to the meeting.

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,790
Lastly, we'll send a reply from our fake Kira, agreeing to the meeting.

84
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,230
Don't tell me... you think that they'll show up, despite how tightly the security around that area will be monitored?

85
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,090
Don't tell me... you think that they'll show up, despite how tightly the security around that area will be monitored?

86
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,230
I doubt that the real Kira will show, but I don't know about the second Kira...

87
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,100
I doubt that the real Kira will show, but I don't know about the second Kira...

88
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,530
We don't know how stupid they really are... or even if they truly are as stupid as they seem.

89
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,340
We don't know how stupid they really are... or even if they truly are as stupid as they seem.

90
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,100
We don't know how stupid they really are... or even if they truly are as stupid as they seem.

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,680
I'll try and see if I can figure out any other hidden messages.

92
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,990
If they're using a code that only those with a Shinigami's power would understand, then I won't be able to break it.

93
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,300
But... we'll need to ensure that we keep a close surveillance on all of the locations that are mentioned.

94
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,710
But... we'll need to ensure that we keep a close surveillance on all of the locations that are mentioned.

95
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,900
The 22nd; met up with a friend in Aoyama.

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,710
The 24th; met up with a friend in Shibuya.

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:32,850
Realistically, we can't expect any results, but we'll need to pay attention to anyone that's in Aoyama with a notebook, and anyone shopping clothes in Shibuya.

98
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,400
Just as I thought.

99
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,860
If the second Kira is caught, then I have to ensure that I get their notebook at the very least,

100
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,280
and in the worst case scenario, kill them and anyone else that's there.

101
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,470
I'll arrange to increase the number of surveillance cameras around Shibuya and Aoyama as much as possible.

102
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,250
In addition, on the respective days, we'll need to have as many plainclothes policemen as possible at each location.

103
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,830
Well, I'll go, since I'll easily be able to blend in with the crowd at Aoyama and Shibuya.

104
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,040
I'll go as well.

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,030
Light!

106
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,000
It'll be okay, father.

107
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:12,970
I occasionally go to Aoyama and Shibuya. Besides, I'm the least likely to look out of place wandering around there with Matsui-san.

108
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,480
Moreover, the only person the second Kira is interested in, is Kira.

109
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,710
Well, Matsui-san, let's leave the plans for Aoyama and Shibuya until tomorrow.

110
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,340
Okay, got that. Light-kun, take care.

111
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,710
As soon as I get back outside and switch my phone back on, this always happens...

112
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,150
Yes?

113
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,530
This is Ryuuzaki.

114
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,000
I need you to observe Light-kun carefully during those two days as well.

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,680
This is confidential, so please keep this to yourself.

116
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,760
Yes... I understand.

117
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,850
"As long as my suspicions aren't at 0%, be suspicious of his every move"... is that what he's saying?

118
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,520
I'm home.

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,000
Light! You're home late?

120
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,900
Yeah.

121
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,010
They told me to keep my assistance with the investigation a secret...

122
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,280
I've got a girlfriend at the university now.

123
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,260
Oh!

124
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,920
What?! Onii-chan's got a girlfriend?!

125
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,530
What?! Onii-chan's got a girlfriend?!

126
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,120
Incredible!

127
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,670
Hey, hey, I'm an 18 year old university student; it's only natural, right?

128
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,430
Hey, hey, I'm an 18 year old university student; it's only natural, right?

129
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,360
Sayu, you've got to try harder too.

130
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,650
Eh?! I-I don't want to try hard!

131
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,510
Eh?! I-I don't want to try hard!

132
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,820
Light? What about dinner?

133
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,640
Light? What about dinner?

134
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,260
I had room service at the hotel, so I'm fine.

135
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,690
Onii-chan! What do you mean by "hotel"?!

136
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,390
What? What? What kind of scandal have I unearthed?!

137
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,800
So, Ryuk... there's something I want to ask you.

138
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,990
So, Ryuk... there's something I want to ask you.

139
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,230
Ah, I thought so.

140
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,730
If you're able to answer, please do.

141
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,420
Are Shinigami on Earth allowed to talk to one another?

142
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Not too sure.

143
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,560
I think that from the moment I possessed a human, it became against the rules for me to do that kind of thing without the human's permission,

144
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,000
but there isn't really a law against talking, so the other Shinigami may come and talk to me.

145
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:17,000
So, you mean that there's a possibility that when the second Kira's Shinigami sees you, they'd be allowed to tell them that I am Kira?

146
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,810
Normally, they wouldn't. It depends on their personality.

147
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,890
So, is is safe for me to assume that your personality is what I believe it to be?

148
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,460
So, is is safe for me to assume that your personality is what I believe it to be?

149
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,880
Yup. If I saw a human with a Shinigami, I wouldn't tell you.

150
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,780
Yup. If I saw a human with a Shinigami, I wouldn't tell you.

151
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,310
Well, I think that's the right choice, Ryuk.

152
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,660
Well, I think that's the right choice, Ryuk.

153
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,530
Thanks.

154
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,140
Huh? The fake Kira's already thought it through this far?!

155
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,280
Huh? The fake Kira's already thought it through this far?!

156
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,960
What is it?

157
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,660
Aoyama is a huge place. I was doing some research on how to go about looking for them, and I found this...

158
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,380
Aoyama is a huge place. I was doing some research on how to go about looking for them, and I found this...

159
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,380
On the 22nd, there's an event at the "Note Blue" nightclub.

160
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,350
Aoyama literally translates to "Blue Mountain"

161
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,540
Aoyama...

162
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,350
"Blue"... and "Note"...

163
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,560
Seems that they've put a bit of effort into this.

164
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,980
It's possible that they're smarter than I thought.

165
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,440
Although if that's true, I may have to be more careful.

166
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,490
Right now, it seems that going to this "Note Blue" might be worth a shot.

167
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,740
But you don't want them to find out that you're Kira, do you?

168
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,670
Err... Light-kun...

169
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,270
What's this?

170
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,550
These are my friends at the university.

171
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,140
Nice to meet you.

172
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,050
This is my cousin, Tarou-san.

173
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,910
It's his first time in Tokyo, and he says he wants to have fun somewhere like Aoyama or Roppongi.

174
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,560
So, let's do our best for him.

175
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,270
He's also looking for a girlfriend, any applicants?

176
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,390
Hey, Light-kun!

177
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,760
Just what I expected from Light-kun!

178
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,660
No one would think that there are police present in this group of young people.

179
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,720
If I move around in a group, even if Ryuk gets seen, they won't know who he's possessed.

180
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,360
If I move around in a group, even if Ryuk gets seen, they won't know who he's possessed.

181
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,540
If I move around in a group, even if Ryuk gets seen, they won't know who he's possessed.

182
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,550
In addition, it'll act as a wall against L's surveillance cameras.

183
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,120
It's not bad for investigative purposes either, all that remains is to watch the entrance of "Note Blue" prior to, and after the performance.

184
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,940
Found you!

185
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,010
Yagami... Tsuki-kun, is it?

186
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,950
Yagami... Tsuki-kun, is it?

187
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,540
月 = "Tsuki" (moon). Read as Light in this case, but this is not shown by the written form.

188
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,140
You're the only person whose lifespan I can't see!

189
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,290
That settles it! He's Kira!

190
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't think that it'd be this easy to meet you!

191
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,670
Hey, Rem, let's go home.

192
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,180
Huh, already? After all the effort you've put into meeting him?

193
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:08,020
It'd be bad for me to go up to him with all these people around and say something like, "I'm so happy to meet you, Kira-san!", wouldn't it?

194
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,000
Now that I know his name, it'll be easy to find out more.

195
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,980
It's an unusual name, after all.

196
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,800
Oooh! So it's written "Tsuki" but pronounced as "Light"!

197
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,500
Yagami Light
PROFILE
D.O.B.: 1989 February 28th
Height: 179cm
Weight: 54 kg
Blood type: A

198
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,500
Oooh! So it's written "Tsuki" but pronounced as "Light"!

199
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,270
That's kinda beautiful!

200
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,630
Still, he's pretty amazing, isn't he, this Yagami Light...

201
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,260
Apparently, while he was in his second and third year at Junior High, he was the National Tennis Champion!

202
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,010
Also, for Toudai University's Entrance Ceremony this year, he gave the speech as the freshers' representative!

203
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,760
There's no photo, but it can't be anyone else with a name like this.

204
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,190
I'd never guessed that Kira would be so young and handsome...

205
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,860
Everything is far better than I'd imagined it would be!

206
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,210
There are places unashamedly selling registers, too.

207
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,230
This world is such a twisted place.

208
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,640
Now I know his address too!

209
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:15,130
In the end, on both the 22nd in Aoyama and the 24th in Shibuya, there was no evidence of any suspicious activity occurring.

210
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,810
All that remains now is the Dome on the 30th.

211
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,850
There was no one suspicious at "Note Blue" either...

212
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,090
Don't tell me that it's really going to happen at the Dome?

213
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,920
Ryuuzaki! Sakura TV have received another message from the second Kira.

214
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,400
It's postmarked the 23rd.

215
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,190
I was able to find Kira.

216
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,150
To everyone at the TV station and the police force, thank you.

217
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,520
I-Impossible?! Where? At Aoyama?

218
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,860
I-Impossible?! Where? At Aoyama?

219
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,870
I-Impossible?! Where? At Aoyama?

220
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,790
I-Impossible?! Where? At Aoyama?

221
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,500
Did their Shinigami see Ryuk and tell them that?

222
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,820
No... In the crowd, it should have been impossible to tell who Ryuk was possessing...

223
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,790
No... In the crowd, it should have been impossible to tell who Ryuk was possessing...

224
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,380
I took every precaution to ensure that I wasn't followed...

225
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,350
If this really is connected to the diary... and was really posted on the 23rd... the only date it leaves is the 22nd, in Aoyama, as a corresponding date.

226
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,590
If this really is connected to the diary... and was really posted on the 23rd... the only date it leaves is the 22nd, in Aoyama, as a corresponding date.

227
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,600
If this really is connected to the diary... and was really posted on the 23rd... the only date it leaves is the 22nd, in Aoyama, as a corresponding date.

228
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,350
The only people to have gone from headquarters were Matsuda and Yagami Light.

229
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,000
So, is Yagami Light Kira, after all?

230
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,500
Yet there's absolutely no proof that it happened in Aoyama...

231
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,000
This is bad, they've found them.

232
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,700
Does this mean that Kira and the second Kira have joined forces...?

233
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,610
No, we don't know for sure that they've joined forces yet.

234
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,240
The second Kira only said that they'd "found" Kira.

235
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,460
They may yet have to make contact.

236
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,850
Now that we've progressed this far, the only thing that we can do is have the police appeal to the second Kira.

237
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,130
Now that we've progressed this far, the only thing that we can do is have the police appeal to the second Kira.

238
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,650
Appeal to?

239
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,470
Yes. The police will need to offer the second Kira a favorable deal if they tell us who Kira is.

240
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:54,100
Yes. The police will need to offer the second Kira a favorable deal if they tell us who Kira is.

241
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,000
Things can't get any worse for you, can they?

242
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,040
This isn't good... I have absolutely no idea how this second Kira may react...

243
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,030
This isn't good... I have absolutely no idea how this second Kira may react...

244
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,150
Yet, there's no way that I can stop them...

245
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,540
If Kira doesn't already know who you are, it's not too late.

246
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,330
You mustn't approach Kira purely for the fun of it.

247
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,010
If you come in contact with Kira, you will almost certainly die.

248
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,090
You'll only be used!

249
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,890
All you should do now, is to think carefully about the value of human life.

250
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,550
Give us all the information you have on Kira, and atone for your crimes.

251
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,990
Save the people of the world from the fear of Kira.

252
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
Where are you going?

253
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,730
To confess.

254
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,070
Oh, so this is the choice you've made...

255
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,600
I wonder if that's Dad...

256
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,950
Coming!

257
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,480
Welcome home!

258
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,660
Eh?

259
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,600
Good evening. My name is Amane Misa.

260
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,260
Good evening. My name is Amane Misa.

261
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,600
I've come to return an important notebook that Light-san left behind at university.

262
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,290
P-Please wait for a moment.

263
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,990
P-Please wait for a moment.

264
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,040
Onii-chan!!

265
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:09,870
Notebook?!

266
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,510
Don't tell me?!

267
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:25,800
P-Pleased to meet you. I'm Amane Misa.

268
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,450
P-Pleased to meet you. I'm Amane Misa.

269
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,700
P-Pleased to meet you. I'm Amane Misa.

270
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,660
I was watching the TV, and I thought that you might worry about me, so I just had to come here.

271
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:35,990
This notebook...

272
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,080
Death Note?!

273
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,130
A Shinigami!

274
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,880
It's the fake Kira...

275
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,900
Come in.

276
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,510
Oh, are you sure that it's okay? I'm so happy.

277
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,280
Oh, are you sure that it's okay? I'm so happy.

278
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,090
Mother, she's gone through all the effort of bringing this over, so could we get some tea or something?

279
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,970
Mother, she's gone through all the effort of bringing this over, so could we get some tea or something?

280
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,690
Yes, yes of course.

281
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,190
I've told you about this before.

282
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,860
Take a seat.

283
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,840
Thank you.

284
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,850
How did you know?

285
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,260
Ah, you really haven't traded your eyes, have you?

286
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,590
If you trade your eyes with a Shinigami, you're able to see people's names and lifespans,

287
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,940
If you trade your eyes with a Shinigami, you're able to see people's names and lifespans,

288
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,740
but you're unable to see the lifespan of someone who has a Death Note.

289
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,770
but you're unable to see the lifespan of someone who has a Death Note.

290
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,320
Oh, I-I didn't know that much about it...

291
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,400
Oh, I-I didn't know that much about it...

292
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,870
Okay, I've understood that much, but if you'd been caught, Kira's secrets would've been revealed.

293
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,620
Okay, I've understood that much, but if you'd been caught, Kira's secrets would've been revealed.

294
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,350
It's okay. So far, I haven't been caught, and if I do as you say from now on, I won't get caught.

295
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,030
It's okay. So far, I haven't been caught, and if I do as you say from now on, I won't get caught.

296
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,670
I'm right, aren't I?

297
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,670
And then I'll see L's name.

298
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,980
I'll be your eyes...

299
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,340
so...

300
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,650
So?

301
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,850
Please make me your girlfriend!

302
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,700
G-Girlfriend?

303
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,380
Yes!

304
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,060
If I handle this the wrong way, I could end up dead, but...

305
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,720
Impossible.

306
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,870
That day in Aoyama, there were triple the usual number of surveillance cameras operating.

307
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,520
If you went to Aoyama that day, you would have been captured on tape somewhere.

308
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,390
I'll be there as well.

309
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,000
If we were to become close after that...

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,250
Even meeting each other now is risky.

311
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,870
At least try to understand that.

312
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,180
These are photos of me on the day I went to Aoyama.

313
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,350
There's no doubt that she's unrecognizable.

314
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,220
So, what about fingerprints?

315
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,480
All those things you sent to the TV station were covered in the same fingerprints.

316
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,760
But those aren't my fingerprints!

317
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,690
Even I think through things a little before I act!

318
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,200
Until recently, I was living in Kansai, and I had a friend there who was interested in the occult.

319
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:25,410
I made a fake video containing footage of spirits and approached her about sending it to some TV stations.

320
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,210
She was really into the idea, and I got her to dub ten copies.

321
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:37,230
Then I copied the "Kira" over to them, without getting my own prints on them, and added the audio.

322
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,140
So, what's your friend doing now?

323
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,850
If you told me to kill them, I'd do it right now!

324
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,620
If you still refuse to trust me, you can look after this notebook.

325
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,820
If you still refuse to trust me, you can look after this notebook.

326
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,740
As long as you only look after it, I'll still be the owner, so I should still be able to use the power of my eyes.

327
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,580
Right, Rem?

328
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,120
That's true.

329
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:10,370
This way, I won't be able to kill you, but if I become useless to you, you can kill me.

330
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,860
Why is she willing to go this far...

331
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,260
But you could already have torn out a page of the Death Note and hidden it somewhere.

332
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,430
Why do you have to be so suspicious of me?!

333
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,910
I don't mind if I really am just used by you!

334
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,350
Please, believe me...

335
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,560
How can she say such things?

336
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:39,280
A year ago, my parents were murdered right in front of me by a burglar.

337
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,730
I couldn't forgive that... yet the trial dragged on and on. Eventually they judged that he'd been falsely accused..

338
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,990
I couldn't forgive that... yet the trial dragged on and on. Eventually they judged that he'd been falsely accused..

339
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,000
But then... Kira passed judgment on him.

340
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,020
To me, Kira is an absolute being!

341
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,360
No matter... no matter what, I wanted to meet you!

342
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,760
No matter... no matter what, I wanted to meet you!

343
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,020
I wanted to say thank you.

344
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,690
You went through all this trouble for the sole purpose of meeting Kira?

345
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,760
She was able to implement the bare minimum of countermeasures against surveillance cameras and leaving fingerprints...

346
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,700
She's not as stupid as I thought...

347
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,020
Plus, she's saying that she'll do as I say from now on...

348
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,700
Plus, she's saying that she'll do as I say from now on...

349
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,310
I understand...

350
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,470
I can't be your boyfriend, but I can pretend to be one.

351
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:58,610
Those eyes of yours, which you traded half your life for in order to find and aid me, will be a great weapon.

352
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,680
Thank you. I'll try my hardest to make you love me.

353
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,740
Thank you. I'll try my hardest to make you love me.

354
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

355
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,360
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

356
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,360
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

357
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,490
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

358
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,490
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

359
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:39,270
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

360
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:39,270
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

361
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:46,050
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

362
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:46,050
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

363
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,120
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

364
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,120
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

365
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,260
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

366
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,260
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

367
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:03,910
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

368
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:03,910
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

369
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,070
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

370
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,070
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

371
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,550
Samazama na negative ni

372
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,550
I'm not so weak,

373
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,880
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

374
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,880
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

375
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,740
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

376
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,740
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

377
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,830
Preview

378
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,020
You're a friend that I really get along with as well.

379
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,750
It's lonely with you being absent from university.

380
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,710
I'd like to play tennis with you again at some point.

381
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,800
Next Time

382
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,800
Friend
