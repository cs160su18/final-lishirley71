Resurrection

93
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,850
Ryuuzaki, let me go.

94
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,230
Chief, I'm coming too!

95
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,210
Understood.

96
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,570
Remember that you're dealing with Kira.

97
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,980
Under no circumstances should you let him see your face, and exercise extreme caution while restraining him.

98
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,740
Watari, if Higuchi makes even one suspicious move...

99
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,970
I understand. I'll immobilize him without actually killing him.

100
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,250
I understand. I'll immobilize him without actually killing him.

101
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,910
Aizawa, did you bring something to obscure your face with?

102
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,130
Yes.

103
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,300
Back us up.

104
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,930
Understood! Thank you very much, Chief!

105
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,140
Understood! Thank you very much, Chief!

106
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,980
Higuchi, put both hands up and step out of the car!

107
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,490
Higuchi has been secured.

108
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,110
Mogi-san, as we planned, place the transceiver on him.

109
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,710
Yes!

110
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,960
Higuchi, how were you killing people? Answer me!

111
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,430
Higuchi, how were you killing people? Answer me!

112
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,000
Higuchi, how were you killing people? Answer me!

113
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,680
If you don't, we'll make you confess using any means at our disposal.

114
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,880
It's a notebook...

115
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,730
A notebook?

116
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:58,110
You probably won't believe me, but if you write the name of a person whose face you know in that notebook, that person will die.

117
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,500
A notebook...

118
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,440
Yagami-san?

119
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,510
Yes... I've found it in his bag.

120
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,440
It's true there are names written here, but there's nothing unusual about this note--

121
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,960
It's true there are names written here, but there's nothing unusual about this note--

122
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,210
What's wrong, Yagami-san?

123
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,420
M-Monster!!

124
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,610
M-Monster!!

125
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,420
Calm down. Yagami-san, you aren't carrying a gun at the moment.

126
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,260
Calm down. Yagami-san, you aren't carrying a gun at the moment.

127
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,520
Yes... yes, that's right.

128
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,260
Yes... yes, that's right.

129
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,660
Are you okay, Chief?

130
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,740
M-Mogi! Can't you see that thing?!

131
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,390
M-Mogi! Can't you see that thing?!

132
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,770
M-Mogi! Can't you see that thing?!

133
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,350
Chief, you're very tired at the moment--

134
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,360
What's happening, Mogi-san?!

135
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,610
A-Ah... I-It looks like only those who've touched this notebook can see this... this monster!

136
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,210
A-Ah... I-It looks like only those who've touched this notebook can see this... this monster!

137
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,980
A-Ah... I-It looks like only those who've touched this notebook can see this... this monster!

138
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,710
A-Ah... I-It looks like only those who've touched this notebook can see this... this monster!

139
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,030
A-Ah... I-It looks like only those who've touched this notebook can see this... this monster!

140
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,840
Please bring that notebook to the helicopter.

141
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,120
R-Right...

142
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,840
What can you possibly be planning, Yagami Light?

143
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:06,600
By touching a Death Note that you previously owned, all your memories associated with it will be recovered.

144
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,720
However...

145
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,740
Ryuuzaki, here it is.

146
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,960
I-It's a Shinigami... they really do... exist...

147
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,370
I-It's a Shinigami... they really do... exist...

148
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,570
I-It's a Shinigami... they really do... exist...

149
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,690
Yagami Light...

150
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,040
Notebook...

151
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,870
Showed each other our notebooks in Aoyama...

152
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,950
Love at first sight...

153
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,920
The second Kira...

154
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,710
Ryuuzaki, give me the notebook!

155
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,620
Kira's method of killing...

156
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,580
Kira... the second Kira...

157
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,880
Two notebooks...

158
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,180
More than one notebook exists.

159
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,560
It's not over yet...

160
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,730
I am L...

161
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,450
I am L...

162
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,120
A-Are you okay? Anyone would be petrified if they saw that monster.

163
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
A-Are you okay? Anyone would be petrified if they saw that monster.

164
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,460
A-Are you okay? Anyone would be petrified if they saw that monster.

165
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,950
Ryuuzaki?

166
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,640
Yes?

167
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,630
Firstly, we've got to compare the names written here against the list of victims.

168
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,690
Erm... yes... I suppose you're right...

169
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,190
Erm... yes... I suppose you're right...

170
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,390
Erm... yes... I suppose you're right...

171
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,550
I've won.

172
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,010
Just as planned!

173
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,290
I'm relinquishing all ownership of this notebook.

174
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,290
The ownership of this notebook now returns to Rem. Correct?

175
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,260
The ownership of this notebook now returns to Rem. Correct?

176
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,150
Correct. Your point being?

177
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,170
Correct. Your point being?

178
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,420
Okay, now give that notebook to Ryuk.

179
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,290
Fine.

180
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,330
The owner of this notebook is now Ryuk.

181
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,350
Ryuk, next, I want you to drop that notebook here, onto the ground of the human world.

182
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,310
Huh? Well, guess it's okay...

183
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,570
And so the ownership returns to me.

184
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,990
So the ownership has gone round in a circle; nothing has changed.

185
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,080
Maybe...

186
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,580
But there'll be a time when this will be of use.

187
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,990
And the first notebook that I received from Ryuk...

188
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,130
I'm giving it back to you, and I want you to give it to Rem.

189
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,560
Here.

190
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,560
Rem, I'll need you to pass that to someone who has a reasonably high status, yet remains greedy for success.

191
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,270
Someone who'll undoubtedly use the notebook to further those goals.

192
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,330
Doing this will guarantee Misa's release from imprisonment.

193
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,060
If she still hasn't been released after several years, kill me. How's that?

194
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,020
If she still hasn't been released after several years, kill me. How's that?

195
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,650
Yagami Light, what are you planning?

196
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,250
Yagami Light, what are you planning?

197
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,600
This is all to save Misa. Trust me.

198
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,250
This is all to save Misa. Trust me.

199
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,550
Understood... if this will help Misa, I'll do as you say.

200
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,880
Understood... if this will help Misa, I'll do as you say.

201
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,000
Next, I'll manipulate the situation so, like Misa, I'll be detained and under 24-hour surveillance.

202
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,540
While in detention, I'll relinquish all ownership of the Death Note and it'll erase any associated memories I've got.

203
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:55,410
During that time, the judging of criminals will recommence, and if that continues, at some stage, Ryuuzaki will be forced to release us both.

204
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,760
And then, with my memories gone, I'm sure I'll attempt to catch Kira.

205
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,080
And then, with my memories gone, I'm sure I'll attempt to catch Kira.

206
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,780
It's just the type of person I am.

207
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,470
So, you plan to find the person Rem gives the notebook to before L can, and reclaim the notebook?

208
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,890
Exactly. And I'll kill whoever has ownership of it.

209
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,470
Exactly. And I'll kill whoever has ownership of it.

210
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,470
But there is one problem:

211
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,770
If you hold no ownership over that Death Note, your memories will only return as long as you're physically touching it.

212
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,480
The moment you let go, all your memories will be erased once more.

213
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,320
I need to kill Higuchi without letting go of this notebook.

214
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,890
That way, the ownership will pass to me, and my memories won't disappear.

215
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,720
If I pull this four times with less than a second between each...

216
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,750
Success! I knew I'd be wearing this at the time.

217
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,210
Success! I knew I'd be wearing this at the time.

218
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,790
Old habits die hard.

219
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,840
Yagami-san, please escort Higuchi to the car.

220
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,380
O-Okay... understood.

221
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,040
O-Okay... understood.

222
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,190
O-Okay... understood.

223
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,560
This notebook... if analyzed scientifically, I wonder if we'd discover anything.

224
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,280
This notebook... if analyzed scientifically, I wonder if we'd discover anything.

225
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,320
This notebook... if analyzed scientifically, I wonder if we'd discover anything.

226
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,390
Yagami-kun, that's not like you. That thing is beyond science.

227
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,530
Yagami-kun, that's not like you. That thing is beyond science.

228
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,160
I guess you're right.

229
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,000
This is the longest 40 seconds of my life...

230
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,920
Higuchi! Ryuuzaki! Higuchi is...

231
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,490
Higuchi! Ryuuzaki! Higuchi is...

232
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,210
Higuchi! Ryuuzaki! Higuchi is...

233
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,650
What?! What's going on?!

234
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,420
What?! What's going on?!

235
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,050
Hey, Higuchi?!

236
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,010
What are you doing, father?! If Higuchi dies now...

237
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,390
What are you doing, father?! If Higuchi dies now...

238
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,470
T-This isn't possible... but I think he's...

239
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,660
T-This isn't possible... but I think he's...

240
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,780
T-This isn't possible... but I think he's...

241
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,450
Yeah, he's dead.

242
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,660
Yeah, he's dead.

243
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,180
The next, Ryuuzaki... will be you.

244
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,090
The next, Ryuuzaki... will be you.

245
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,250
"How to use"...

246
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,930
"Those whose names are written in this notebook will die."

247
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,160
"This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when they write his/her name."

248
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,960
"Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected."

249
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:37,500
"If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen as it is written."

250
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,020
"If the cause of death is not specified, by default, the person will die of a heart attack"

251
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:49,500
"Should a cause of death be specified, a further 6 minutes 40 seconds are granted to write any further details."

252
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,940
Furthermore, in the "How to use"-section at the back, it states:

253
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,110
"If this notebook is made unusable via shredding, burning and so forth, all those who have touched the notebook will die."

254
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,240
What?! Is that true, Aizawa-san?

255
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,890
What?! Is that true, Aizawa-san?

256
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,170
Yup, it's written right here.

257
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:17,710
There's no doubt that while that rule exists, they won't destroy the notebook, and there's no danger of me losing my memory.

258
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,370
Aw.. that's just shit... why didn't you tell me this earlier?

259
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,870
Rem, I won't get in trouble with the old man for writing in fake rules, will I?

260
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,350
No, there are no rules regarding that.

261
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,440
Alright then. But Light, I'm counting on you for more apples.

262
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,630
Alright then. But Light, I'm counting on you for more apples.

263
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,100
Maybe I shouldn't have said "I want to see the Shinigami too", and touched that...

264
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,150
If you hadn't, you'd be the only one in the investigation not knowing what's going on.

265
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,950
Is that what you want?

266
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,200
N-No, I want to be on the same level as everyone else in this investigation. Really!

267
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,010
And this final sentence...

268
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,960
"From the moment a new user writes a name into this notebook, they must continue to write names,

269
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:09,000
each within 13 days of the last; otherwise, the user will die."

270
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,630
Oh! This means that both Light-kun and Misa-Misa are completely cleared!

271
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,150
Oh! This means that both Light-kun and Misa-Misa are completely cleared!

272
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,710
It's true.

273
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,400
Light-kun and Amane were imprisoned for over 50 days, and even now are under surveillance. If either were Kira, they'd no longer be alive.

274
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,110
Light-kun and Amane were imprisoned for over 50 days, and even now are under surveillance. If either were Kira, they'd no longer be alive.

275
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,580
That's great news, isn't it, Chief?

276
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,230
Yes.

277
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,720
Rem-san... wasn't it? The white person over there.

278
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,360
Rem-san... wasn't it? The white person over there.

279
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,090
R-Ryuuzaki, that's rude! You can't go around calling them "white".

280
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,090
Correct.

281
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,090
There are other Death Notes in the human world, aren't there?

282
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,990
Not sure. Maybe there are, maybe there aren't.

283
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,070
If other notebooks did exist, would the rules be the same for all of them?

284
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,770
If other notebooks did exist, would the rules be the same for all of them?

285
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,980
It's no use, Ryuuzaki. There's no way that Rem will let you cast doubt upon these rules.

286
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,610
It's no use, Ryuuzaki. There's no way that Rem will let you cast doubt upon these rules.

287
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,550
Yes, they'd be the same.

288
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,950
There are many notebooks within the world of Shinigami, but the rules are all the same.

289
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,000
Those notebooks under human possession also share a common set of rules.

290
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,680
Ryuuzaki, the suspicions surrounding Light-kun and Amane have been cleared.

291
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,410
It's time to end their surveillance.

292
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,020
He's right, it's obvious.

293
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,070
You're right...

294
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,970
I understand.

295
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,010
I apologize for everything up until now.

296
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,020
I'm so glad.

297
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,630
Yeah.

298
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,850
But the case is still far from solved.

299
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,990
Although these handcuffs will be removed, I'll continue to investigate from here, if that's alright.

300
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:53,840
Yes.

301
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,050
Now Misa and I are 100% clear of suspicion.

302
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,110
Rules written by a Shinigami in a Death Note... you'd have to believe them.

303
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,740
Rules written by a Shinigami in a Death Note... you'd have to believe them.

304
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,140
Thanks to the fake rules I created, Ryuuzaki has nowhere to go from here.

305
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,230
Understand this Ryuuzaki: in any world, rules are something that are made by the gods.

306
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,380
Understand this Ryuuzaki: in any world, rules are something that are made by the gods.

307
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,430
You will bow down to the rules I've created.

308
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,540
You tried to oppose me, the new god of this world, and for your transgression, you will die.

309
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,870
Light! Promise me that you'll text me every single day.

310
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,410
I can't believe that I finally have to part with Misa-Misa...

311
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,160
Oi, Matsuda, leave them alone.

312
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,050
See ya, Misa-Misa!

313
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,810
Hey!

314
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,030
Even if we can be seen on the security cameras, from this angle, they shouldn't be able to see my mouth.

315
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,220
Misa, when you're certain that no one else is around, I want you to go to the place I'm about to tell you and dig up something for me.

316
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,260
Light! Your memories have returned!

317
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,920
Don't worry, Misa will do good!

318
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,370
Light, I remember! Everything that happened back when I was using this notebook... You must have buried this notebook so that I'd remember too!

319
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,150
Light, I remember! Everything that happened back when I was using this notebook... You must have buried this notebook so that I'd remember too!

320
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,080
Light, I remember! Everything that happened back when I was using this notebook... You must have buried this notebook so that I'd remember too!

321
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,740
Misa, if you're reading this, it's likely that your memory has been restored.

322
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,330
A letter from Light!

323
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,820
Do you remember a friend of mine, from Todai University, who introduced himself as "Ryuuga Hideki"?

324
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,290
I want you to write his real name in this notebook and bury him.

325
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,200
Then, as soon as possible, burn this letter.

326
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,740
Take only a few pages from the notebook, and re-bury the notebook itself.

327
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,350
The next time you see me, touch me with a piece of paper from this notebook as naturally as you can.

328
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,760
If you can obey me in all this... I'll love you, forever.

329
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,560
...love you, forever!

330
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,780
If you can obey me in all this... I'll love you, forever.

331
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,840
Yay!

332
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,650
I see. This is all Light's plan.

333
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,860
For me to obtain this notebook and regain my memory... and kill Ryuuga Hideki... Ryuuzaki...

334
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,520
For me to obtain this notebook and regain my memory... and kill Ryuuga Hideki... Ryuuzaki...

335
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,990
For me to obtain this notebook and regain my memory... and kill Ryuuga Hideki... Ryuuzaki...

336
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,320
This should remove another obstacle for Light, and I'll have helped him!

337
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,040
It's no good, Light. I can't remember his name.

338
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,310
It's no good, Light. I can't remember his name.

339
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,730
I used to see tens, hundreds of names and lifespans every day...

340
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,540
There's no way I can remember! Stupid Misa!

341
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,850
There's no way I can remember! Stupid Misa!

342
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,030
Finally! I'm back!

343
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,980
Ryuk! It's so good to see you again!

344
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,600
How have you been?

345
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,320
Erm, sorry but... being male and all that... that kinda makes me blush.

346
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,180
Erm, sorry but... being male and all that... that kinda makes me blush.

347
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,420
Erm, sorry but... being male and all that... that kinda makes me blush.

348
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,240
Oh, yeah!

349
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,760
Here you are!

350
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,450
Light told me to bring it along.

351
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,040
Is it that good?

352
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,100
Yeah. Apples in the human world are... how d'ya say it? "Juicy"?

353
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
In any case, they're damned good.

354
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,560
You wanna try eating one?

355
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,050
Huh?

356
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,010
It's an apple from the world of Shinigami.

357
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,520
Doesn't look very tasty...

358
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,390
Take a bite.

359
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,300
Oh, yeah, Ryuk. I want to trade eyes with you.

360
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,180
Oh, yeah, Ryuk. I want to trade eyes with you.

361
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,000
Sand!!

362
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,860
You wanna make a deal, huh?

363
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,980
You realize that you've already made a deal with Rem once, right?

364
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,160
Your remaining lifespan has already been halved once; you sure you wanna do it again?

365
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Your remaining lifespan has already been halved once; you sure you wanna do it again?

366
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,340
It can't be helped I guess.

367
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,970
I've completely forgotten the one name that I needed to remember.

368
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,410
Light will be mad at me unless I go and find it out again.

369
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,290
Well, that's fine by me.

370
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,010
It's Misa-Misa!

371
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:42,530
Poor thing. We can't switch our cell phones on in here, so Misa-Misa has to come all the way here, just to see Light-kun.

372
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,270
Light, hurry up and go see her.

373
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,250
You shouldn't keep a lady waiting.

374
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,620
Sure.

375
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,500
Ryuk! Why is he with Misa?!

376
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,160
Ryuk! Why is he with Misa?!

377
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,800
Misa's lifespan has halved again!

378
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,140
Surely she didn't trade eyes with Ryuk?!

379
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,710
Light.

380
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,200
Long time no see, Ryuk.

381
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,140
L-Light, I'm so sorry. I can't remember Ryuuga Hideki's name, no matter how hard I try!

382
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,370
L-Light, I'm so sorry. I can't remember Ryuuga Hideki's name, no matter how hard I try!

383
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,460
L-Light, I'm so sorry. I can't remember Ryuuga Hideki's name, no matter how hard I try!

384
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,370
L-Light, I'm so sorry. I can't remember Ryuuga Hideki's name, no matter how hard I try!

385
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,290
I see...

386
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,250
Well, that's a shame...

387
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:33,670
B-But I traded eyes with Ryuk!

388
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,500
B-But I traded eyes with Ryuk!

389
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,840
It's all going according to plan, huh?

390
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,580
You idiot! That means your lifespan has...

391
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,360
You idiot! That means your lifespan has...

392
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,790
It doesn't matter. I want to help you!

393
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,870
Misa, I want to be with you in an ideal world for as long as possible.

394
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,560
That's the way I feel, right now.

395
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,070
Light! I'm so happy!

396
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,500
Misa, let's build a new world together... a world without criminals, filled only with kind-hearted people.

397
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,110
Misa, let's build a new world together... a world without criminals, filled only with kind-hearted people.

398
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

399
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,410
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

400
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,410
This one page of everlasting depression;

401
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

402
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
hakanai senpou sono meni

403
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,270
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

404
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,270

406
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,850
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

407
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,500
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

408
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,500
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

409
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,350
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

410
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,350
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

411
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,790
Who would know of a path to salvation?

412
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,790
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

413
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,640
World of acquittal,

414
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,640
Menzai no waarudo

415
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,470
words of retribution!

417
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,210

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,090
Goodbye

437
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,880
Next time

438
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,880
Silence
