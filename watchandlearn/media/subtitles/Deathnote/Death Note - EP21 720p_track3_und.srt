Activity

93
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,420
Hey, weren't these meetings supposed to be fortnightly? Seems they're getting more frequent than ever.

94
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,650
Hey, weren't these meetings supposed to be fortnightly? Seems they're getting more frequent than ever.

95
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,440
It can't be helped.

96
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,990
We've received a report from Coil which claims that Amane Misa may know L.

97
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,570
According to his report, "Amane Misa was questioned by L", but... here is where the problems arise.

98
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,840
According to his report, "Amane Misa was questioned by L", but... here is where the problems arise.

99
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,380
According to his report, "Amane Misa was questioned by L", but... here is where the problems arise.

100
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:48,310
"Based on what we know so far, it's fair to say that Amane idolizes Kira.

101
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,720
Furthermore, Yoshida Productions are pressing the Yotsuba Group to use her as a campaign girl.

102
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,720
I propose that the Yotsuba Group employ Amane in a commercial and utilize this opportunity to find out more about L."

103
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,980
Personally, I'm not entirely satisfied with this plan...

104
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,110
Why not? Sounds like a good plan to me.

105
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,120
Why not? Sounds like a good plan to me.

106
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:17,810
No, what Ooi means is that Coil is the one who's supposed to be uncovering L's identity, yet he has entrusted this to us.

107
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,200
The original contract was for him to reveal L's identity.

108
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,660
Maybe Coil should be present at this meeting?

109
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,990
You could be right...

110
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,230
Kida-san, I thought the original agreement was that you'd avoid calling me unless absolutely necessary.

111
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,770
Kida-san, I thought the original agreement was that you'd avoid calling me unless absolutely necessary.

112
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,630
Is this urgent?

113
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,100
Understood. If that's the case, I've got an excellent idea...

114
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,680
Understood. If that's the case, I've got an excellent idea...

115
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,350
Even though the meeting is over and I'm finally home, there's still criminals to take care of...

116
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,690
Being Kira is hectic business...

117
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,720
But it's about to get interesting...

118
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,860
Without a doubt, Amane Misa was the second Kira and was caught by L.

119
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:09,250
The fact that she escaped in that situation can only mean that she relinquished her ownership of the Note and lost her memories.

120
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,010
This is just too good an opportunity to pass up...

121
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,210
I'm going to take Amane Misa as my wife.

122
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,140
Money, power, and a beautiful wife.

123
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,920
Money, power, and a beautiful wife.

124
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
Money, power, and a beautiful wife.

125
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,020
I'll be the envy of everyone.

126
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,330
Once we're married, I'll spend plenty of money on her life insurance policy.

127
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,000
Once we're married, I'll spend plenty of money on her life insurance policy.

128
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,630
Surely, this degenerate wouldn't...

129
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,400
Surely, this degenerate wouldn't...

130
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,660
Rem, hide the notebook in the usual place.

131
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,170
Right now, the only thing I can do for Misa... is this...

132
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,180
Right now, the only thing I can do for Misa... is this...

133
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,470
Okay, let's take it from the next part...

134
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,010
Misa-san, you went to Tokyo specifically hoping to meet Kira...

135
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,810
Misa-san, you went to Tokyo specifically hoping to meet Kira...

136
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,600
Look here...

137
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
Misa-san, I know the line sucks, but try not to overreact.

138
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,420
Misa-san, I know the line sucks, but try not to overreact.

139
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,320
Whaa? This is what's known as credible acting!

140
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,000
Never mind, let's just try this again.

141
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,460
Fine, fine, Mr. Ryuuzaki Director Sir...

142
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,910
If you don't start taking this seriously, you'll be feeling my foot.

143
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,690
M-Misa-Misa...

144
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,890
M-Misa-Misa...

145
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,500
Your face looks strained. Just "Misa" is fine, Mochii.

146
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm not cut out for this... but this is one of my duties too, and will aid in catching Kira...

147
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,670
I'm not cut out for this... but this is one of my duties too, and will aid in catching Kira...

148
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,910
Misa-Misa!

149
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,680
What's wrong, Mochii?!

150
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,610
Today's interview with the Yotsuba Group is of course an opportunity for you to appear in their commercials,

151
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,930
but it's also a part of our undercover investigation.

152
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,440
You don't need to tell me that, I already know!

153
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,790
Also, you better not mess up either. Remember, you're supposed to be a super-energetic manager!

154
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,360
Also, you better not mess up either. Remember, you're supposed to be a super-energetic manager!

155
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,310
Alright! I'll do my best!

156
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,310
Alright! I'll do my best!

157
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,410
Sorry to keep you waiting.

158
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,120
Good morning!

159
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,630
I'm Misa-Misa's manager, Moji Kan'ichi, also known as Mochii.

160
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,120
Ooi-san, Shimura-san, nice to see the both of you again!

161
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,120
Pleased to meet you!

162
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,040
Go for it, Misa-Misa!!

163
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,400
Mochii can really pull some tricks when he needs to.

164
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,650
I'll go and prepare the celebrations for when you land this commercial!

165
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,010
I'm not cut out for this... am I?

166
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,350
I don't believe we've met before, have we, Misa-san?

167
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,480
I'm John Wallace, the main adviser of the Advertising Department. It's a pleasure to meet you.

168
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,150
Pleased to meet you too.

169
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,110
So, let me get straight to the point and be honest with you.

170
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,610
The decision to hire you to be in our commercials has more or less already been made.

171
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,120
But before we seal the deal, there's just one more thing I'd like to have confirmed.

172
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,370
Yes?

173
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,830
We've taken the liberty of doing some investigation into your background;

174
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,960
it seems that you idolize Kira for killing the thieves that murdered your parents,

175
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,470
and that you went to Tokyo specifically hoping to meet Kira.

176
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,480
W-Who... did you hear that from?

177
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,670
W-Who... did you hear that from?

178
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,980
We can't reveal our sources, but our information is accurate.

179
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,400
Even your entire face screams "busted".

180
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,790
Coil... I had no idea that he'd found out so much already...

181
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,970
And... there's still something that you're hiding from us, right?

182
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,530
And... there's still something that you're hiding from us, right?

183
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,300
Something you wouldn't want the public to find out.

184
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,210
This is the point where I've got to start sweating and pause for a moment...

185
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,940
"Amane Misa was restrained by L". I'd like to hear the truth straight from your own mouth.

186
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,300
"Amane Misa was restrained by L". I'd like to hear the truth straight from your own mouth.

187
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,680
We can't afford to have the Yotsuba campaign girl turn out to be Kira.

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Agreed. Please be honest with us regarding this.

189
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,310
I-I understand... I'll tell you everything.

190
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,400
I-I understand... I'll tell you everything.

191
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,530
I-I understand... I'll tell you everything.

192
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,370
It's true I was restrained... but I didn't know it was L's doing.

193
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,660
It's true I was restrained... but I didn't know it was L's doing.

194
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,480
I was asked about Kira, but I'm not the second Kira, and they realized that I had no connection with Kira.

195
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,280
I was asked about Kira, but I'm not the second Kira, and they realized that I had no connection with Kira.

196
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,840
I was asked about Kira, but I'm not the second Kira, and they realized that I had no connection with Kira.

197
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,660
That's why I'm here right now.

198
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,380
Did you manage to see the face of the person restraining you?

199
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,720
No, I was blindfolded.

200
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,900
Yet, you must have heard their voice, right?

201
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,610
But their voice was coming out of some speakers...

202
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,020
Come on now, this seems more like an interrogation than an interview.

203
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,690
Come on now, this seems more like an interrogation than an interview.

204
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,270
How long are you planning to keep this up?

205
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,460
I'm going to the toilet.

206
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,360
Certainly, it's true that we may have been going off on a bit of a tangent there.

207
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,080
Erm... would it be okay for me to go to the toilet too?

208
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,280
Erm... would it be okay for me to go to the toilet too?

209
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,570
This is so nerve-racking...

210
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,410
But so far it seems to be going well... I've got to keep doing my best.

211
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,550
Even by touching this scrap of paper, her lost memories won't return... but at least Misa will be able to see me now.

212
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,550
Even by touching this scrap of paper, her lost memories won't return... but at least Misa will be able to see me now.

213
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,120
W-What is this?! A ghost?!

214
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,160
W-What is this?! A ghost?!

215
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,470
W-What is this?! A ghost?!

216
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,890
Misa, right now you're in a dangerous situation where you could be killed by members of the Yotsuba Group at any moment.

217
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:28,000
Misa, right now you're in a dangerous situation where you could be killed by members of the Yotsuba Group at any moment.

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,860
I had to come and tell you this.

219
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,380
Calm down and listen.

220
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,950
"Calm down"? This ghost is much more likely to kill me!

221
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,780
"Calm down"? This ghost is much more likely to kill me!

222
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,580
I'm your ally, Misa.

223
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,990
My... ally?

224
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,330
My... ally?

225
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,460
I wonder if Misa-Misa is okay?

226
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,980
Maybe we should at least have made her wear a wire.

227
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,990
There's no doubt that it's a different person.

228
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,150
The Kira prior to my detention and the current Kira... they're definitely different.

229
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,890
The Kira prior to my detention and the current Kira... they're definitely different.

230
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:05,210
The current Kira is killing off absolutely anyone who's been broadcast as a murderer, but...

231
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:14,050
those who had no murderous intent... those who killed unintentionally... and those with mitigating circumstances...

232
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,990
they were never judged by the previous Kira.

233
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,850
If I was Kira, I'd also judge in such a discerning way...

234
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,030
The basis of the previous Kira's judgments are terrifyingly close to my own ideals...

235
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,760
What am I thinking?

236
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,690
I'm not Kira.

237
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,280
Comparing myself to Kira? There's clearly something wrong with me...

238
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,930
Yagami Light is Kira.

239
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,000
What is Light currently doing?

240
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,740
What are you?

241
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,730
I can tell that you're not a stalker, but you don't even remotely resemble a human.

242
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,240
I can tell that you're not a stalker, but you don't even remotely resemble a human.

243
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,000
Of course. I'm a Shinigami.

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,870
Of course. I'm a Shinigami.

245
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,920
There was once a time when we worked inseparably together.

246
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,460
Everything you're saying... I don't understand any of it...

247
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,160
Misa has met you?! Light is Kira?!

248
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,550
Misa has met you?! Light is Kira?!

249
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,210
Death Note.

250
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,980
If you write a person's name in it, the person whose name was written will die.

251
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,020
If you write a person's name in it, the person whose name was written will die.

252
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,880
Using that Note, Yagami Light passed judgment on criminals and became widely known as "Kira".

253
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,410
Using that Note, Yagami Light passed judgment on criminals and became widely known as "Kira".

254
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,650
And you held the same power as Kira. No, a power even greater than that.

255
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,270
And you held the same power as Kira. No, a power even greater than that.

256
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,630
And you held the same power as Kira. No, a power even greater than that.

257
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,040
Using that power you were able to successfully approach Kira, in other words, Yagami Light.

258
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,500
Light is Kira? And Misa is the second Kira?

259
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,370
Light is Kira? And Misa is the second Kira?

260
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,270
That's correct. Or more accurately, you used to be.

261
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,050
That's correct. Or more accurately, you used to be.

262
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,840
That's correct. Or more accurately, you used to be.

263
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:03,240
However, the current situation should all be a part of Light's plan.

264
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,460
Ryuuzaki... he's right!

265
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,790
Ryuuzaki... he's right!

266
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,550
Misa...

267
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,150
Do you still love Light enough to die for him?

268
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,640
Shinigami-san, you're the real deal.

269
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,360
You know everything about Misa! I'll believe everything you say.

270
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,610
You know everything about Misa! I'll believe everything you say.

271
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,170
Yes... I love him... to death.

272
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,750
Yes... I love him... to death.

273
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,920
Yes... I love him... to death.

274
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:35,660
The fact that Light was Kira, and Misa was Kira, that we both were Kira together... that's truly fantastic!

275
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,670
I believe it!

276
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,530
You never change, Misa.

277
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,400
And I doubt that those feelings you have for Light will ever change either.

278
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,780
So from now on, I'll accept that your happiness lies in being with Light, and supporting him.

279
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,000
So from now on, I'll accept that your happiness lies in being with Light, and supporting him.

280
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,650
Thank you, Shinigami-san!

281
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,330
I'm Rem.

282
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,690
Presently, the current Kira is a disgusting lowlife.

283
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,170
There's no telling what he might do. Be careful of him.

284
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,600
There's no telling what he might do. Be careful of him.

285
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,700
The same goes for any human who works for Yotsuba.

286
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,830
Just trust Light, and let him handle it his way.

287
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,210
Got it. All Misa has got to do is act natural, right?

288
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,710
Got it. All Misa has got to do is act natural, right?

289
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,250
That's right.

290
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,000
Once you return to the interview, you should be able to tell who Kira is.

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,190
Once you return to the interview, you should be able to tell who Kira is.

292
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,070
Be especially wary of him.

293
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,140
I apologize for taking so long in the toilet.

294
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,100
I even fixed my make-up in there!

295
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,830
Once you return from the toilet, the man sitting in front of me will be Kira.

296
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,650
Rem...

297
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
The person sitting in front of Rem is Kira.

298
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,560
Higuchi is Kira?! It couldn't get any worse...

299
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,960
Higuchi is Kira?! It couldn't get any worse...

300
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,820
Misa-Misa is late...

301
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,790
She's back!

302
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,630
Heya!

303
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,510
Phew... I'm so tired.

304
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,530
Hey...

305
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,560
How did it go?

306
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,030
Yotsuba has decided to employ Misa in a multi-platform advertising campaign.

307
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,580
Is that so? That's good.

308
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,020
Is that so? That's good.

309
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:33,000
I gave them both my phone number and my e-mail address, and already three out of the seven have contacted me in private and asked me out!

310
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,290
Whaaat?!

311
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,640
Now I just need to accept their offers and begin investigating them, right?

312
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,230
Everything is going according to the plan!

313
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,310
No, that plan has been cancelled.

314
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,360
Why?! It's all gone so well!

315
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,140
This method places you in too much danger.

316
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,730
I won't tell you not to do the commercial, but from now on, you'll deny that you were the second Kira and were restrained by L.

317
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,370
I won't tell you not to do the commercial, but from now on, you'll deny that you were the second Kira and were restrained by L.

318
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,500
You'll be guarded by Mogi-san, and you'll only work in your capacity as a "campaign girl".

319
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,330
Bu--

320
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,170
If Light says so, I'll do it.

321
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,200
Well, Misa is tired and she needs to be on location early tomorrow, so she's off to bed.

322
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,070
Thank you for worrying about me, Light... but I've thought of an excellent plan!

323
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,630
Thank you for worrying about me, Light... but I've thought of an excellent plan!

324
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,880
I'll definitely help you, Light!

325
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,680
Light? You want to sleep with me?

326
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,970
Light? You want to sleep with me?

327
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,510
What are you talking about, Misa?

328
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,240
I know. We can do that after Kira is caught, right?

329
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,560
I know. We can do that after Kira is caught, right?

330
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,810
No need to get so embarrassed, Light!

331
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,860
You don't have to be embarrassed, Light-kun.

332
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,370
I'm not embarrassed.

333
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,820
Why are you taking it so seriously, Light-kun?

334
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,680
Cut!

335
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,710
That's a wrap!

336
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,090
Great job, everyone!

337
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,910
Yeah, nice work.

338
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,850
Well done, Misa-Misa!

339
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,870
I'm allowed to use the bathroom in this hospital, aren't I?

340
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,920
Sure! Off you go!

341
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,340
Sure! Off you go!

342
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
Just wait here a moment.

343
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,380
Yes?

344
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,510
Senpai! Good job at work!

345
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,010
Wow! Mori-chan, that nurse's outfit really suits you!

346
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,730
Oh, really?!

347
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,580
That went smoothly...

348
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,640
Wow! I knew you would have an amazing car!

349
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,710
If you like, I'll take you for a ride anytime. No, I'll just buy you one.

350
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,110
In any case, that nurse's outfit looks great, Misa-chan.

351
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,040
You like it?

352
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,990
You took a while...

353
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,550
Where's Misa?!

354
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,730
She's on a date...

355
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,930
Damn it!

356
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:21,670
Higuchi Kyousuke... since we had that reception... he has persistently messaged and asked me out... that dirty old man.

357
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,550
Misa-chan, why don't you give me your number?

358
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,800
You're just my type, I'll be really good to you.

359
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,670
Oi, Higuchi! Stop trying to get in before anyone else can!

360
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,430
It's truly horrible that Kira has to be someone like this.

361
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,760
Misa-chan, you fancy getting something to eat?

362
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,330
You're not planning to take me anywhere dubious are you?

363
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,730
Well, even if you do try anything funny, Misa can kill people, so she'll be fine.

364
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,010
What are you thinking, Misa?

365
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,150
Is this something Yagami Light has told you to do?

366
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,240
No. She must be attempting to tell me that if it comes down to it, I have to kill Higuchi...

367
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,490
You're so funny, Misa-chan. You can kill people?

368
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,080
It's true, because Misa is... the second Kira.

369
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,830
It's true, because Misa is... the second Kira.

370
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:07,930
N-No way. Even if this girl used to be the second Kira, she can't still be, can she?

371
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,860
N-No way. Even if this girl used to be the second Kira, she can't still be, can she?

372
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,580
N-No way. Even if this girl used to be the second Kira, she can't still be, can she?

373
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,710
She should have no memory of it.

374
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,720
What's going on?!

375
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,350
There's no need to lie just because you're wary of me, Misa-chan.

376
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,020
I'm actually quite the gentleman.

377
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,940
Well, Misa has no interest in showing proof that she's the second Kira to anyone but Kira...

378
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,190
You'll only show it to Kira? Is that so?

379
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,280
You'll only show it to Kira? Is that so?

380
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,980
Misa's dream is to become Kira's wife!

381
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,770
I'm absolutely certain that Kira needs Misa.

382
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:48,600
From the incidents at Sakura TV, it's evident that the second Kira has the Shinigami's Eyes.

383
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,990
If this is true, I've got to keep her by my side, no matter what.

384
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,800
Let's try a test...

385
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,960
Well, since I'm Kira, you'd better marry me, Misa-chan!

386
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,900
Really?!

387
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,880
Eh... Yeah, really.

388
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,120
Eh... Yeah, really.

389
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,070
Eh... Yeah, really.

390
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,300
Proof! We should show each other proof!

391
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,970
Impossible. It's far too dangerous to show anyone that you have the ability to kill people.

392
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,370
Impossible. It's far too dangerous to show anyone that you have the ability to kill people.

393
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,240
You think so? If Misa thought someone was Kira, she'd offer them proof of her own initiative.

394
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,250
You think so? If Misa thought someone was Kira, she'd offer them proof of her own initiative.

395
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,090
Unless someone makes the first move, nothing will happen.

396
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,090
Well, kill someone then. I could be Kira you know.

397
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,370
Well, kill someone then. I could be Kira you know.

398
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,190
Fine, but I only kill bad people.

399
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,180
Fine, but I only kill bad people.

400
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,870
I see... "Bad" people, huh?

401
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,510
I see... "Bad" people, huh?

402
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,090
Kaneboshi Ginzou. President of a large consumer financing company.

403
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,440
Kaneboshi Ginzou. President of a large consumer financing company.

404
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,940
A notorious villain that collects what he's owed through cruel methods. In some cases, he's forced people to pay out of their own life insurance.

405
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,260
How about him?

406
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,720
Will you be able to check instantly if he's dead or not?

407
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,440
I just need to make a call.

408
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,970
Then, can you face that way for a moment?

409
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,520
Misa, you want me to kill Kaneboshi Ginzou, right?

410
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,890
Misa, you want me to kill Kaneboshi Ginzou, right?

411
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,150
That way, Higuchi will believe you.

412
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,270
I can do that...

413
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,130
Kaneboshi Ginzou

414
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,550
Okay. He should be dead by now.

415
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,800
It's Higuchi from Yotsuba...

416
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,890
The president has just collapsed and stopped breathing! This will have to wait!

417
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,580
See?

418
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,620
She killed the person I specified, right here and now...

419
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,300
Unless she has the power, it would be impossible.

420
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,290
That decides it!

421
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,830
If I'm Kira, you'll marry me, right?!

422
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,620
W-Why are you looking so serious all of a sudden?

423
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,700
W-Why are you looking so serious all of a sudden?

424
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,800
Because I am Kira.

425
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,430
Then, prove it.

426
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,680
I've got to go home to kill, you understand that, right?

427
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,730
Well, that's no good. It could merely be a trick to get Misa to go back to your place.

428
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,200
I know! Why don't you try and stop the judging of the criminals?

429
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,560
I know! Why don't you try and stop the judging of the criminals?

430
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,080
If you really are Kira, you should be able to manage that.

431
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,890
And when Misa tells you to, you can begin judging them again.

432
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,790
I'll believe you if that happens, since only Kira should be able to control the judging of criminals.

433
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,530
I'll believe you if that happens, since only Kira should be able to control the judging of criminals.

434
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,360
I see... Nice idea...

435
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,880
Alright then.

436
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,890
I'm Kira. So in order to make you believe me, I'll stop judging criminals.

437
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,970
And once you realize that I am Kira, we're getting married!

438
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,710
So, as you can all hear...

439
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,940
Higuchi is Kira!

440
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,830
Thanks to this we know Kira's identity, and the judging of criminals that the Chief was so worried about will end too!

441
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,690
Thanks to this we know Kira's identity, and the judging of criminals that the Chief was so worried about will end too!

442
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,220
This is amazing, Misa-Misa!

443
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,000
To be continued

444
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
This one page of everlasting depression;

445
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

446
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,020
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

450

Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

451
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,870
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

452
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,520
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

453
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,520
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

454
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,370
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

455
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,370
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

456
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,810
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

457
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,810
Who would know of a path to salvation?

458
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,660
World of acquittal,

459
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,660
Menzai no waarudo

460
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,490

462
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,230
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

464
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,220
