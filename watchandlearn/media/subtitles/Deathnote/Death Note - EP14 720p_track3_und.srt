00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,020
Friend

17
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,850
I understand. I can't be your boyfriend, but I can pretend to be one.

18
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,000
I understand. I can't be your boyfriend, but I can pretend to be one.

19
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,800
Thank you. I'll try my best to make you love me.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,620
Thank you. I'll try my best to make you love me.

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,200
I'll show her L's face and find out his name, then I'll erase him along with his investigation team.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,020
Killing her can wait till after...

23
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,450
She's the one person that knows Kira's true identity.

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,920
I can't leave her alive for too long.

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,400
"Pretend to be", huh?

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,960
I guess that'll do for now.

27
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,580
Anyway, let's get to the point: will you show Misa your Shinigami?

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,280
I guess I'll have to if I want her to trust me.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,270
Okay... turn around for me.

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,600
Okay... turn around for me.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,350
Okay!

32
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,020
You can turn back now.

33
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,210
Okay!

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,040
Heya!

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,540
Wow! Even though you're a Shinigami, you and Rem are completely different types!

36
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,780
I've heard about you, if only by name, Ryuk!

37
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,050
Nice to meet you!

38
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,260
Yes, nice to meet you too.

39
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,660
Oh yeah! Light! Do you know how Shinigami die?

40
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,440
You're already using Light, my first name?

41
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,960
Well, can I call you "Knight" instead of "Light", then?

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,430
To Misa, you're like a knight on a white horse!

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,190
"Light" is fine.

44
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,650
You're not seriously going to check all the video footage from Aoyama on the 22nd all by yourself, are you?

45
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,070
Yes. There is a real possibility that Kira and the second Kira made contact there.

46
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,010
Yes. There is a real possibility that Kira and the second Kira made contact there.

47
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,700
I'd like to check all of these.

48
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,570
Also, Yagami-san...

49
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,580
Ah, yes?

50
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,000
have Mogi-san keep a close eye on Light-kun's movements.

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,710
Light's movements?

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,580
If by any chance he really is Kira, the second Kira may try to approach him in some way.

53
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,680
I understand...

54
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,700
I wonder when Ryuuzaki actually sleeps...

55
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,710
I caught him sleeping, just like that, in his chair once...

56
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,650
Huh?

57
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,800
No, really...

58
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,360
So, you're saying that if a Shinigami has feelings for a specific human, and kills another human, in order to prolong the lifespan of the one they have feelings for... they'll die?

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,290
So, you're saying that if a Shinigami has feelings for a specific human, and kills another human, in order to prolong the lifespan of the one they have feelings for... they'll die?

60
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,160
So, you're saying that if a Shinigami has feelings for a specific human, and kills another human, in order to prolong the lifespan of the one they have feelings for... they'll die?

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,320
That's right.

62
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,940
I can't imagine that any Shinigami would do something like that.

63
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,990
Well, you'll certainly never do anything of the sort.

64
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,010
So, where have you been sending the video tapes to the TV station from?

65
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,650
Well... the first one was from Osaka, then from Tokyo, and the last one was from Nagano.

66
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,220
Well... the first one was from Osaka, then from Tokyo, and the last one was from Nagano.

67
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,380
Well... the first one was from Osaka, then from Tokyo, and the last one was from Nagano.

68
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,950
Well... the first one was from Osaka, then from Tokyo, and the last one was from Nagano.

69
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,980
I tried to ensure that they couldn't pin down an exact location, so I used the shinkansen.

70
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,980
Shinkansen is a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan.

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,350
So, you still have tapes and envelopes with your friend's fingerprints, right?

72
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,670
So, you still have tapes and envelopes with your friend's fingerprints, right?

73
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,440
Yeah.

74
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,740
You better destroy everything you used to make those videos...

75
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,410
That is, after we send the final tape from yet another different location tomorrow.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,250
What should it say?

77
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,080
"I have decided not to reveal myself to Kira. To the police, thank you very much for the warning.

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,980
"I have decided not to reveal myself to Kira. To the police, thank you very much for the warning.

79
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,830
However, I will join Kira in purging the world of evil, and will gain their acceptance through aiding them.

80
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,670
However, I will join Kira in purging the world of evil, and will gain their acceptance through aiding them.

81
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,430
However, I will join Kira in purging the world of evil, and will gain their acceptance through aiding them.

82
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,440
I will begin by passing judgment on all criminals that Kira has not judged already.

83
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,270
Then, I shall proceed by sharing these powers with people that I find worthy and would like to continue making this world a better place."

84
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:01,650
Then, I shall proceed by sharing these powers with people that I find worthy and would like to continue making this world a better place."

85
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,900
"Share these powers"?

86
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,460
It's simply a line to confuse the investigation.

87
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,540
Since there are already two people who have this power, it's not inconceivable that there may be more.

88
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,620
Since there are already two people who have this power, it's not inconceivable that there may be more.

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,580
If they believe that this figure could increase, they'll become more impatient.

90
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,160
Can you do this?

91
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,190
Don't say "Can you do this?". Just tell me to do it!

92
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,970
I will do whatever you ask of me.

93
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,070
There's one more important thing that I've got to mention...

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,630
Yes!

95
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,700
If we get caught by the police... even if we get caught as suspects... we can't mention anything about each other or the notebooks.

96
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,040
If we get caught by the police... even if we get caught as suspects... we can't mention anything about each other or the notebooks.

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,060
If we get caught by the police... even if we get caught as suspects... we can't mention anything about each other or the notebooks.

98
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,010
Unless they have the notebooks, there is no proof.

99
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,770
Can you swear to this?

100
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,510
I swear!

101
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,780
So, this concludes the boyfriend-girlfriend contract, right?

102
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,740
I guess so.

103
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,110
Then, now for my stipulations:

104
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,830
At minimum, there must be at least one date a week.

105
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,680
She doesn't get it after all...

106
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,460
That's not possible.

107
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,460
Why?!

108
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,440
It seems like you won't understand unless I spell it out for you.

109
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,590
L already suspects that I am Kira.

110
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,240
Wow, this "L" is really impressive...

111
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:15,380
Most people believes that he knows nothing, or that he's an idiot, when in fact he's already...

112
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,740
I won't say it's entirely thanks to that, but I've managed to get in direct contact with L.

113
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,650
I won't say it's entirely thanks to that, but I've managed to get in direct contact with L.

114
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,250
L and Kira are in contact?! Both of you are amazing!

115
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,400
L and Kira are in contact?! Both of you are amazing!

116
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,570
I'm getting a little excited...

117
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,580
L thinks that even if I am Kira, as long as he keeps his name hidden, he's safe.

118
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,830
So, to investigate me further, he revealed himself to me as "L".

119
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,260
But, the only proof he has, is that he has no other suspects.

120
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,200
In fact, if I act naturally around him, I expect he'll trust me and we'll investigate together.

121
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,130
In fact, if I act naturally around him, I expect he'll trust me and we'll investigate together.

122
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,970
So, all you have to do is take Misa to L?

123
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,130
It's not that easy.

124
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,520
It was hard enough for me to try and get close to him...

125
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,220
But more importantly, if someone suddenly starts to make contact with me, while at the same time,

126
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,870
But more importantly, if someone suddenly starts to make contact with me, while at the same time,

127
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,540
Kira and the second Kira's attitudes towards society are changing, that person will be suspected of being the second Kira.

128
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,090
Kira and the second Kira's attitudes towards society are changing, that person will be suspected of being the second Kira.

129
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,490
The suspicions of me being Kira will then deepen.

130
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,810
We can't allow them to think that we've suddenly met and started to go out with each other.

131
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,130
Do you understand what I'm saying?

132
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,060
Sort of... is that why you're saying we won't be able to go out on dates?

133
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,250
You can't see me because it'd make them suspicious?

134
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,250
No... it'd probably be better if you start thinking carefully about how you're going to see L's face without him discovering your existence.

135
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,240
No... it'd probably be better if you start thinking carefully about how you're going to see L's face without him discovering your existence.

136
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,350
Yeah.

137
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,190
In order to get rid of L, I need you.

138
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,010
As much as possible, I'd like to meet you in person to pass on information...

139
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,860
Oh good!

140
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,370
...so, to ensure that our meetings remain unnoticed, I'll aim to go out with lots of different girls.

141
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,970
...so, to ensure that our meetings remain unnoticed, I'll aim to go out with lots of different girls.

142
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,530
...so, to ensure that our meetings remain unnoticed, I'll aim to go out with lots of different girls.

143
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,440
Huh? What do you mean?

144
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,560
Huh? What do you mean?

145
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,840
You'll be dating other girls?

146
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,250
That's what it'll come down to...

147
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,410
No way!!

148
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,210
If I see you doing that... I'll kill the girl.

149
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,860
Scary...

150
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,860
Hey, Misa-chan...

151
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,550
It's "chan" now, is it?

152
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,550
...this is not a game.

153
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,760
We're going to change the world, remember?

154
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,850
I know, but... Misa loves you more than the world...

155
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,980
I know, but... Misa loves you more than the world...

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,250
What are you talking about?

157
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,860
Your feelings for me should be those of a supporter.

158
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,020
Besides, this is the first time you've ever spoken to me.

159
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,750
You've never fallen in love at first sight?

160
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,660
No.

161
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:42,010
It's true that I wanted to meet Kira out of gratitude and sympathy, as opposed to love.

162
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,710
But Light, from the first time I saw you, I...

163
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,110
What the hell is wrong with this woman?

164
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,240
Popular as ever I see!

165
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,850
Well, if you love me, you can obey me, right?

166
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,920
Well, if you love me, you can obey me, right?

167
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,670
First, you said that you didn't mind if I used you, and that you'd do as I say, didn't you?

168
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,150
But I can't forgive you if I see you with another girl!

169
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,360
These are two completely different issues!

170
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,000
Right now, both Death Notes are in my hands.

171
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,190
If you don't obey me, I'll kill you.

172
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,800
I won't let you do that... Yagami Light!

173
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,990
I won't let you do that... Yagami Light!

174
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,300
If you try to kill this girl, I'll write your name in my own Death Note... and kill you.

175
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,740
If you try to kill this girl, I'll write your name in my own Death Note... and kill you.

176
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,250
If you try to kill this girl, I'll write your name in my own Death Note... and kill you.

177
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,830
I can see this girl's lifespan.

178
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,800
If she dies before her time, I'll assume that you were responsible.

179
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,810
If you use the Death Note to kill me, in order to save her, wouldn't you die?

180
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,620
That's right. If you do that, Rem, you'll die!

181
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,330
You're correct... but that's fine by me.

182
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,060
You're correct... but that's fine by me.

183
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,230
What's with this Shinigami... is she serious? Then from this point on...

184
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,440
What's with this Shinigami... is she serious? Then from this point on...

185
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,820
What's with this Shinigami... is she serious? Then from this point on...

186
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,900
Light?

187
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,700
What is it, Mom?

188
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,420
It's already 11:30. You shouldn't have a girl here so late...

189
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,540
Ah, that's true. We were busy talking.

190
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,000
Ah, that's true. We were busy talking.

191
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,210
Sorry, Mom!

192
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,480
I apologize for intruding on you all till such a late hour.

193
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,360
Light, I'll see you soon.

194
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,260
Yeah.

195
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,460
Light, you should walk her to the station.

196
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,970
Right now, walking around outside with her would be...

197
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,040
I'll be fine! Good night!

198
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,340
I'll be fine! Good night!

199
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
She's a cute girl.

200
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,610
Yup, yup. I wasn't too sure about her at first, but she's cute.

201
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,660
She's my type!

202
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,580
If I kill the girl, she'll kill me?

203
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,830
Does that mean I'll have to remain on Rem's good side until she dies?

204
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:54,340
In addition, I'll have to protect her from getting caught by the police.

205
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,360
Thanks to you, Rem, Light truly is my "knight" now.

206
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,760
Seems so.

207
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,980
But you know, you can't really kill him.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,070
To kill a Shinigami, you have to make them use their Death Note to save someone they like.

209
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,810
To kill a Shinigami, you have to make them use their Death Note to save someone they like.

210
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,880
Yet, I can't try to kill her first by manipulating someone via the Death Note to attack Misa.

211
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,300
If Misa gets intro trouble, I'll be the first person she'll suspect, and I'll be killed straight away.

212
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,000
Currently, Rem's an even bigger threat than L.

213
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,230
S-She's... doing something as high profile as this?!

214
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,810
S-She's... doing something as high profile as this?!

215
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,060
S-She's... doing something as high profile as this?!

216
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,060
Amane Misa
Real name: Amane Misa
Hometown: Kyoto
D.O.B.: 1987 December 25th
Size: 152 tall, 76 bust, 51 waist, 75 hip
Blood type: AB

217
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,930
What will happen if they find out that I'm seeing someone like her?!

218
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,870
Damn it! No matter how I look at it, she's just getting in the way.

219
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,150
What can I do...

220
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,190
Wait! More importantly, I need to think of a method of using Misa's eyes to kill L.

221
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,210
If only I could get rid of L...

222
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,290
Onii-chan, good morning!

223
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,330
Good morning.

224
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,790
Mom, Sayu, can you not mention Misa-chan to father?

225
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,250
Okay, okay.

226
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,490
Actually, it's not just father either. I'd like you not to mention this to anyone.

227
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,350
Actually, it's not just father either. I'd like you not to mention this to anyone.

228
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,790
She's an up-and-coming model, so she's not really supposed to have a boyfriend or anything along those lines.

229
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,030
Eh?! Really?! No wonder I thought she was cute!

230
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,630
Just what I'd expect from a girlfriend of yours.

231
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,480
I'll keep your secret... for 5,000 yen!

232
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,270
Idiot.

233
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,530
Toudou University

234
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,710
The final message from Misa will arrive today.

235
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,330
It should be passed directly to the investigation, instead of going to the TV station.

236
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,340
I should stop by Investigative Headquarters and check L's reaction.

237
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,340
Yagami-kun.

238
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,060
Yagami-kun... you said that you'd go out with me, didn't you?

239
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,490
Yagami-kun... you said that you'd go out with me, didn't you?

240
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,150
Yeah, I did.

241
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,240
And here we are, sitting together in lectures.

242
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,060
Yeah?

243
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,150
Yet, you don't seem the least bit happy about it. You seem distracted.

244
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,000
Yet, you don't seem the least bit happy about it. You seem distracted.

245
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,900
That's not true.

246
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:28,280
Miss Toudai is similar to a beauty pageant title. Meaning she's one of the prettiest girls around Toudou University.

247
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:28,280
I was just thinking that going out with "Miss Toudai" means that many people will be saying things about me.

248
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,010
And truthfully, you are extremely beautiful, Takada-san.

249
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,920
Please don't dwell upon such matters.

250
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,710
I don't like fickle things such as "Miss Whatever".

251
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,000
Ah, you're right.

252
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,760
Yet, she clearly didn't mind...

253
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,210
Let's just go at our own pace without worrying about others, okay, Takada-san?

254
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,020
Yes.

255
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,520
'Evening.

256
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,100
Light-kun, you've arrived at a good time.

257
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,990
We've just received another video from the second Kira.

258
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,840
Again? That was fast.

259
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,820
Yes. They state that this is the final one.

260
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,190
Well, take a look.

261
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,260
I have decided not to reveal myself to Kira.

262
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,670
To the police, thank you very much for the warning.

263
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:26,260
However, I will join Kira in purging the world of evil, and will gain their acceptance through aiding them.

264
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,010
I will begin by passing judgment on all criminals that Kira has not judged already.

265
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:37,030
Then, I shall proceed by sharing these powers with people that I find worthy and would like to continue making this world a better place.

266
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,940
Having watched this, I get the feeling that Kira and the second Kira have made contact.

267
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,610
Having watched this, I get the feeling that Kira and the second Kira have made contact.

268
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,490
Why do you feel that they've made contact?

269
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,400
Didn't you feel it?

270
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,200
I assumed that you would get the same impression as I did.

271
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,600
It's the fact that their insistence on meeting Kira has completely changed.

272
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,010
Also, the fact that they now want to judge all the criminals Kira hasn't yet judged in order to be accepted by them.

273
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,600
Why hadn't they done that from the start?

274
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,320
It's because they hadn't thought so far.

275
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,810
Presumably, they've managed to make contact with Kira, who told them to pass this judgment.

276
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,340
Kira has also asked to conceal this link between them.

277
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,400
In that case, Kira is acting without thinking too much then.

278
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Yes.

279
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,220
Has something happened to stop them from thinking so clearly?

280
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,800
Perhaps they're trying to confuse me by making the connection between them obvious.

281
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,530
Realistically, this connection is a huge threat... but due to this, my suspicions towards Light-kun have lessened.

282
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,780
Realistically, this connection is a huge threat... but due to this, my suspicions towards Light-kun have lessened.

283
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,730
Realistically, this connection is a huge threat... but due to this, my suspicions towards Light-kun have lessened.

284
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,920
What do you mean by that, Ryuuzaki?!

285
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,850
If Light-kun was Kira, instead of sending a tape like this, I believe that he'd get the second Kira to make another threat forcing L... that is, me, to appear on TV.

286
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,810
If Light-kun was Kira, instead of sending a tape like this, I believe that he'd get the second Kira to make another threat forcing L... that is, me, to appear on TV.

287
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,440
If Light-kun was Kira, instead of sending a tape like this, I believe that he'd get the second Kira to make another threat forcing L... that is, me, to appear on TV.

288
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,270
As long as we assumed they hadn't made contact yet, it would be the second Kira's responsibility...

289
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,010
As long as we assumed they hadn't made contact yet, it would be the second Kira's responsibility...

290
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,530
Then all he'd need to get them to say is:

291
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,870
"I stopped once when Kira told me to. But I no longer believe that that warning came from Kira. Kira should be pleased if L dies. There's no way that they would try and stop me."

292
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,650
"I stopped once when Kira told me to. But I no longer believe that that warning came from Kira. Kira should be pleased if L dies. There's no way that they would try and stop me."

293
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,380
"I stopped once when Kira told me to. But I no longer believe that that warning came from Kira. Kira should be pleased if L dies. There's no way that they would try and stop me."

294
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,730
"I stopped once when Kira told me to. But I no longer believe that that warning came from Kira. Kira should be pleased if L dies. There's no way that they would try and stop me."

295
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,420
Ryuuzaki...

296
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,300
Yes?

297
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,280
If I truly were Kira... I wouldn't do that.

298
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,750
If I truly were Kira... I wouldn't do that.

299
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,300
Why?

300
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,930
If you genuinely are L, then I know your character.

301
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,640
No matter how you're threatened, there's no way that you'd actually appear on TV.

302
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,520
You would never consider taking the fall for someone else.

303
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,520
Without a doubt, you'd have some sort of plan to get out of it.

304
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,570
So you knew?

305
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:57,320
Light, even if it's purely theoretical, I want you to stop with this "If I were Kira" talk.

306
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,460
Ah, I'm sorry, father.

307
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:09,500
But I want to express my thoughts clearly to Ryuuzaki, so that the case can end quickly, and so that my name can be cleared.

308
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Besides, the reason I can say "If I were Kira", is because I'm not Kira.

309
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,590
That's correct... Light-kun isn't Kira.

310
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,100
That's correct... Light-kun isn't Kira.

311
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,350
Or should I say, it'd be a problem if he was, because... Light-kun is... the first friend I've ever had.

312
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,320
Or should I say, it'd be a problem if he was, because... Light-kun is... the first friend I've ever had.

313
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,570
Or should I say, it'd be a problem if he was, because... Light-kun is... the first friend I've ever had.

314
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,770
Or should I say, it'd be a problem if he was, because... Light-kun is... the first friend I've ever had.

315
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,360
You're a friend that I really get along with as well.

316
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,370
Thanks.

317
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,460
It's lonely with you being absent from university.

318
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,410
I'd like to play tennis with you again at some point.

319
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,170
Yes, by all means.

320
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,930
"Friend"?!

321
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,600
"Friend", huh? Well, good for you, Light.

322
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,970
Ryuuzaki... he's easily managed to deduce the connection between Kira and the second Kira.

323
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,140
Looks like I'll need to get rid of my enemies as soon as possible.

324
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,280
Oh, right...

325
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,410
It'll be even more dangerous to meet Misa from now on.

326
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,200
Light!

327
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:31,030
I couldn't wait an entire two weeks, so I was just on my way over to see you!

328
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,840
This is the first time in my entire life that I seriously wanted to hit a girl...

329
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,850
I just really wanted to see you...

330
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,970
Well, you'd better come to my house.

331
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,990
A girl... again?

332
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,550
Misa-san, welcome!

333
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,400
I've seen a lot of magazines with you in them!

334
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,580
Welcome.

335
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,180
Sorry for disturbing you.

336
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,460
Mom, can we have some tea?

337
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,600
Rem?

338
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,330
Huh?

339
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,630
You're Misa's ally, right?

340
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,710
Yeah, well, I've seen this girl a number of times from the Shinigami world, and due to certain circumstances, I've got some feelings for her.

341
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,150
Yeah, well, I've seen this girl a number of times from the Shinigami world, and due to certain circumstances, I've got some feelings for her.

342
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,470
Yeah, well, I've seen this girl a number of times from the Shinigami world, and due to certain circumstances, I've got some feelings for her.

343
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,640
You've got feelings, despite being a Shinigami?

344
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,640
Seems like you don't like the fact that I said, "If you kill this girl, I'll kill you".

345
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,980
So, does this mean that if Misa is happy, you're happy?

346
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,150
Yeah, that's how it works.

347
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,300
I don't want to see her sad.

348
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,730
Misa really... likes me so much.

349
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,520
Misa really... likes me so much.

350
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,620
Light?

351
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,770
Misa?

352
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,520
Yes?

353
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,370
Is my happiness your happiness too?

354
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,290
Yes.

355
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,420
Can you ask Rem to kill L?

356
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,210
Rem wants you to be happy, yet if one of us is caught by L, that happiness will be threatened.

357
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,660
Rem wants you to be happy, yet if one of us is caught by L, that happiness will be threatened.

358
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,140
Rem wants you to be happy, yet if one of us is caught by L, that happiness will be threatened.

359
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,240
Although Shinigami aren't supposed to tell humans other people's names, there's no rule that stipulates who Rem can and can't kill.

360
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,020
Although Shinigami aren't supposed to tell humans other people's names, there's no rule that stipulates who Rem can and can't kill.

361
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,300
Yeah. If you kill L, I'll have even greater feelings for Misa, and I'd be thankful to you too, Rem.

362
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,870
Yeah. If you kill L, I'll have even greater feelings for Misa, and I'd be thankful to you too, Rem.

363
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,560
Yeah. If you kill L, I'll have even greater feelings for Misa, and I'd be thankful to you too, Rem.

364
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,990
More importantly, we'd both be happy together.

365
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,980
Rem, I want to be loved by Light.

366
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,630
Both of us will be happy... I'll be happy.

367
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,350
Okay...

368
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,020
Okay then, Yagami Light.

369
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,140
I don't like you, so even if I end up prolonging your life, it won't kill me.

370
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,260
I don't like you, so even if I end up prolonging your life, it won't kill me.

371
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,300
I'll kill L. He means nothing to me.

372
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,210
I'll kill L. He means nothing to me.

373
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,000
Yay, Rem! Thank you!

374
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,180
I knew you'd do it!

375
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,570
L is going to die... just like that?

376
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,960
L is going to die... just like that?

377
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

378
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,340
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

379
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,340
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

380
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,470
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

381
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,470
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

382
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:39,250
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

383
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:39,250
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

384
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,030
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

385
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,030
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

386
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,100
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

387
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,100
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

388
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,240
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

389
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,240
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

390
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,890
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

391
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,890
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

392
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,050
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

393
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,050
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

394
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,530
I'm not so weak,

395
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,530
Samazama na negative ni

396
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,860
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

397
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,860
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

398
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,720
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

399
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,720
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

400
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,490
Preview

401
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,850
That's right... seeing as Ryuuga identified himself as L, I should kill him.

402
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,660
That's right... seeing as Ryuuga identified himself as L, I should kill him.

403
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,180
It's a gamble...

404
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,920
Tomorrow, L... Ryuuzaki or Ryuuga, will be your last.

405
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,760
Next Time

406
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,760
Gamble
