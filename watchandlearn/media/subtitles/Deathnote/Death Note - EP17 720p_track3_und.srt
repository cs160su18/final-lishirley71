00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,020
Execution

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,120
I want you to continue disposing of criminals in this manner.

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,300
Once this is over, you can do whatever you want with this notebook.

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,780
That's the deal.

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,560
If everything goes according to Yagami Light's plan, this should save Misa...

21
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,400
This is a good deal for both you and me, don't you agree?

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,630
As you might say, "it's good business", right?

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,390
Imprisonment: Day Fifty

24
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,390
Yagami-san, you okay there?

25
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,360
You know, there's no need for you to continue doing this.

26
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,500
It's been more than a month since criminals began to be killed by Kira again.

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,310
I'm convinced my son is not Kira.

28
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,630
Now all that remains, Ryuuzaki, is for you to realize this too.

29
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,620
When I leave here, it will be with my son.

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,190
The Chief is so stubborn...

31
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,250
Light-kun, are you okay?

32
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,750
I'm okay... but Ryuuzaki... ever since my imprisonment, criminals have stopped dying...

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,930
I'm okay... but Ryuuzaki... ever since my imprisonment, criminals have stopped dying...

34
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm okay... but Ryuuzaki... ever since my imprisonment, criminals have stopped dying...

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,870
I'm okay... but Ryuuzaki... ever since my imprisonment, criminals have stopped dying...

36
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,220
there's a good chance that Kira or someone knows about my current predicament, it might be worth investigating alo--

37
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,380
No.

38
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,770
The reason they've stopped dying is because you are Kira.

39
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,830
That's not true!

40
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,960
I am not Kira!

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,270
How many times do I have to tell you this?!

42
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,030
If you're Kira you would know that criminals are being killed, yet I can't see this in you.

43
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,710
If you're Kira you would know that criminals are being killed, yet I can't see this in you.

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,160
Ryuuzaki is pretty harsh. I can't believe he's not told Light-kun that criminals are still being murdered.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,280
Ryuuzaki is pretty harsh. I can't believe he's not told Light-kun that criminals are still being murdered.

46
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,860
Amane.

47
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,220
Yes?

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,820
You don't look so good. Are you okay?

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,850
What? Are you stupid or something?

50
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,080
If Misa was fine after so many weeks of this, she'd be some kind of weirdo...

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,340
I guess you're right.

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,380
Hurry up and release me.

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,550
I want to see Light... Light... Light... Light...

54
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,210
I want to see Light... Light... Light... Light...

55
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,100
I want to see Light... Light... Light... Light...

56
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,390
I want to see Light... Light... Light... Light...

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,930
It seems like all three of them are reaching their limits.

58
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,150
Ryuuzaki, why do you continue to detain Light-kun?!

59
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,350
You should release him.

60
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,890
That way the Chief will be free as well.

61
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,540
Despite neither Amane nor Light-kun receiving information about them, criminals continue to be killed.

62
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,340
Doesn't this tell you enough?!

63
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,740
No.

64
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,520
The only thing I've been able to establish is Amane's extraordinary love for Yagami Light.

65
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,370
Ryuuzaki... sorry, but personally,

66
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,130
I think you're only doing this because you don't want to accept that your "Light-kun is Kira" theory is wrong.

67
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,840
Oh, so you do think that after all...

68
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,470
It's as Light-kun said. Kira killed Lind L. Tailor and those FBI agents.

69
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,980
If they were able to kill without the need to acquire information, there would have been no need to kill Tailor or the FBI.

70
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,510
No matter how much they were investigated, they would never have been caught!

71
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,620
"Kira does not kill more than it's necessary to."

72
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,700
You said so yourself!

73
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,050
Oh, I see. If they could kill people under those conditions,

74
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,060
Oh, I see. If they could kill people under those conditions,

75
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,580
they could have left the FBI agents alone because they would pose no threat.

76
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,320
Fifty days have already passed.

77
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,940
There's no point in carrying on with this anymore.

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,250
Instead, we should be focusing on capturing the real Kira.

79
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,920
I understand...

80
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,570
Yagami-san?

81
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,700
What is it?

82
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,690
Could I get you to return to Headquarters?

83
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,660
I'd like everyone to hear my verdict on this matter.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,160
I'd like you, Yagami-san, as Light-kun's father, to be the first.

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,090
Fine...

86
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,100
Three days later

87
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,690
I never imagined you would be such an old man, Stalker-san.

88
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,610
I'm not a stalker, I'm a detective.

89
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,210
Detective?!

90
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,030
I remember now!

91
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,240
At the beginning, they mentioned something about "suspicion of being the second Kira"!

92
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,160
They were actually serious about that?!

93
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,110
Surely not... the police would never tie me up like a maniac.

94
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,010
Besides, if you're releasing me, isn't it a little odd to keep my hands and feet cuffed?

95
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,730
Silence.

96
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,900
Light!!

97
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,900
Misa.

98
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,560
Light! I wanted to see you so much!

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,480
Father, what's going on?

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,990
Huh? Father?!

101
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,930
Oh no! Misa called Light's dad a stalker and lots of other rude things!

102
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,950
Pleased to meet you! I'm Amane Misa.

103
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,750
I'm going out with Li--

104
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,490
Take them away, Chief.

105
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,710
What's wrong? Hurry up and get in.

106
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,320
I guess this means we're no longer under suspicion and finally free.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,890
No.

108
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,140
I'm going to be taking you two to the execution chamber.

109
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,150
I volunteered to escort you to a top-secret execution chamber in an underground facility.

110
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,640
Execution chamber?!

111
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,640
What?!

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,580
What are you saying?! Father?!

113
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,580
You're joking, right, dad?!

114
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,470
L has concluded that Yagami Light is Kira and Amane Misa is the second Kira,

115
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,040
and if we dispose of both of you, the "Kira killings" will end.

116
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,040
The "Kira killings" should have stopped already...

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,900
No, they're still taking place.

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,490
Still taking place?! That's not what they told me...

119
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,630
Still taking place?! That's not what they told me...

120
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,950
It was most likely an investigative technique L was using in order to get you to confess.

121
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,520
But that's not the point...

122
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,230
L's proposal of killing both of you, thereby stopping the "Kira killings",

123
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,100
was quickly accepted by all the heads of the United Nations and the Government.

124
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,110
Kira will be executed in secret, away from the public eye.

125
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,790
T-That's stupid! Father! I am not Kira!!

126
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,530
T-That's stupid! Father! I am not Kira!!

127
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,590
That's right, dad!

128
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,370
What are you thinking?! He's you own son!

129
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,670
It wasn't my decision, it was L's decision.

130
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,200
It wasn't my decision, it was L's decision.

131
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,000
He's solved all sorts of impossible problems in the past, and he's yet to be proved wrong.

132
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,370
Father... you're believing L over me?

133
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,670
Father... you're believing L over me?

134
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,990
L has even said that if the murders don't stop, he will take full responsibility for it, and pay with his life.

135
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,050
L has even said that if the murders don't stop, he will take full responsibility for it, and pay with his life.

136
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,060
L, what are you thinking?!

137
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,870
It's true that given all the evidence acquired up till now, the conclusion seems inevitable... but there's been a mistake!

138
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,000
It's true that given all the evidence acquired up till now, the conclusion seems inevitable... but there's been a mistake!

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,270
L, how did he come to such a conclusion?

140
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,960
There's something wrong here... this isn't like L at all.

141
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Up until now, he's always been able to offer solid proof when he solves a case... is he going to end it all just like this?

142
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,620
Up until now, he's always been able to offer solid proof when he solves a case... is he going to end it all just like this?

143
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,650
We've arrived.

144
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,840
Where are we?

145
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,610
What are you planning to do, bringing us to such a remote area?

146
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,710
Dad! Is it possible that you're planning to release us?!

147
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,830
Yes, no matter what we do here, no one will see it.

148
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,420
Yes, no matter what we do here, no one will see it.

149
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,610
I deliberately brought both of you here instead of the execution chamber.

150
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,090
Light... I'm going to kill you here, and then I'll kill myself.

151
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,830
Light... I'm going to kill you here, and then I'll kill myself.

152
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,710
What are you saying, father?! Don't be stupid!

153
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,710
Stop it! Dad! You're crazy!!

154
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,620
You're going to kill your own child and then yourself?!

155
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,040
If you want to die, then just die by yourself!

156
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,260
If you go through with this, then you're no different from Kira!

157
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,060
No, I'm different from Kira.

158
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,720
I have responsibilities, both as a parent, and also as the Chief of Police.

159
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,850
Father, it's exactly as Misa says!

160
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,770
Even if we die here, they still won't know the truth!

161
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,480
If that's the case, it's better to run!

162
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,480
It's too late, Light.

163
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,020
Whatever path you choose, you will be executed, and if that's the case, at least it will be by my hand.

164
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,320
Whatever path you choose, you will be executed, and if that's the case, at least it will be by my hand.

165
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,880
Stop it, father! I'm not Kira!!

166
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,110
Stop it, father! I'm not Kira!!

167
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,320
If I die here, it'll be exactly what Kira wants! Don't you see that?!

168
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,280
If I die here, it'll be exactly what Kira wants! Don't you see that?!

169
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,280
Amane, my son and I will die here, but I have no reason to kill you.

170
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,790
Amane, my son and I will die here, but I have no reason to kill you.

171
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,640
The police will probably find this car soon, and then you can be executed at the formal execution chamber.

172
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,050
The police will probably find this car soon, and then you can be executed at the formal execution chamber.

173
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,490
Light... we're both murderers; see you in hell!

174
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,430
Light... we're both murderers; see you in hell!

175
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,850
Father!!

176
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,690
Stop!!

177
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,110
Light... we're both murderers; see you in hell!

178
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,620
Light... we're both murderers; see you in hell!

179
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,460
Father!!

180
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,280
...a blank?

181
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,320
Thank god...

182
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,870
What do you mean, "Thank god"? What are you doing, father?

183
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,830
What do you mean, "Thank god"? What are you doing, father?

184
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,090
Both of you, forgive me.

185
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,160
This was the sole method of freeing you.

186
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,000
But, believe me, I only did this because I truly believe that you are not Kira.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,590
Were you watching that, Ryuuzaki?

188
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,340
I did exactly like you asked, and as you can see, I'm still alive.

189
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,770
Yes, it was a very realistic performance.

190
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,430
Yes, it was a very realistic performance.

191
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,660
If Amane was truly the second Kira and could kill purely by looking at someone,

192
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,690
I'm sure we can assume she would have killed Yagami-san before he shot Light-kun.

193
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,640
And if Light-kun was Kira, the way I have imagined Kira to be, they would kill even a parent if necessary.

194
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,080
And if Light-kun was Kira, the way I have imagined Kira to be, they would kill even a parent if necessary.

195
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,480
However, in Light-kun's case, I can't dismiss the possibility that he may have figured out that it was an act at some point.

196
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,290
But, as promised, I'll end their imprisonment.

197
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,990
And also as promised... Amane Misa, although you may insist that those tapes are occult videos,

198
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,120
And also as promised... Amane Misa, although you may insist that those tapes are occult videos,

199
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,760
due to your confession that you sent them, and other points of evidence,

200
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,630
you will remain under surveillance until Kira is caught, and everything is resolved.

201
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,440
What's up with that? Are you still suspicious of me?!

202
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,730
Well, you can return to your everyday life. Isn't that enough?

203
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,690
As long as you're innocent, all surveillance means, is that you'll be protected by the police.

204
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,460
Oh, really? Well, since Misa isn't the second Kira, she just has to think of it as having a bodyguard!

205
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,470
Oh, really? Well, since Misa isn't the second Kira, she just has to think of it as having a bodyguard!

206
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,360
Also, Light-kun, as promised, I'm prepared to make a pact with you;

207
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,080
Also, Light-kun, as promised, I'm prepared to make a pact with you;

208
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:58,440
that is, you'll be with me 24/7 assisting me with this investigation.

209
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,840
I understand, Ryuuzaki. Together we'll catch Kira.

210
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,810
I understand, Ryuuzaki. Together we'll catch Kira.

211
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,290
Yes, I'll be counting on you.

212
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,470
Is it really necessary to go this far, Ryuuzaki?

213
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,440
You know, I'm not doing this because I want to.

214
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,060
Eh? This is what you meant by being with each other 24/7?!

215
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,880
You're both guys, it's kinda creepy...

216
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,460
So, you lean that way, Ryuuzaki-san?

217
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,570
Look, I said I'm not doing this because I want to.

218
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,070
But Light is Misa's Light after all, and if you're around 24 hours a day, when is Misa supposed to go on dates?

219
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,170
Unavoidably, when you go on a date, it'll be the three of us together.

220
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,630
What?! Does that mean we have to kiss and stuff in front of you?!

221
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,530
I didn't say you had to.

222
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,420
But I will have to maintain surveillance.

223
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,530
What's with that?! You're a pervert after all!!

224
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,300
Light-kun, please get Misa-san to shut up.

225
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,800
Misa, stop being selfish over this.

226
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,100
Given that they can prove you sent those tapes in, you should be thankful for being released.

227
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,380
Given that they can prove you sent those tapes in, you should be thankful for being released.

228
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,660
Huh? Even you are saying this?

229
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,650
Misa is your girlfriend! Don't you believe in your own girlfriend?

230
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,920
You say that you're my girlfriend... but you've just been chasing me around saying that you fell in love with me at first sight...

231
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,100
You say that you're my girlfriend... but you've just been chasing me around saying that you fell in love with me at first sight...

232
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,850
So, when I said, "I love you", you just took advantage of that to kiss me?

233
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,190
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Je-erk!!

234
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,450
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Je-erk!!

235
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:15,840
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Je-erk!!

236
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,370
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Je-erk!!

237
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,700
Regarding you "falling in love at first sight", that happened on the 22nd of May in Aoyama, right, Misa-san?

238
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,460
Regarding you "falling in love at first sight", that happened on the 22nd of May in Aoyama, right, Misa-san?

239
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,250
Yes?

240
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,230
On that day, why did you go to Aoyama?

241
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,590
What clothes were you wearing?

242
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,290
Look, I just went on a whim. How many times do you want me to say this?

243
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,220
I honestly can't remember how I was feeling, or what I was wearing that day.

244
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,980
Is it that wrong of Misa to hang around Aoyama without a reason?

245
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,290
So, when you returned home from Aoyama, you knew Light-kun's name, someone you had just fallen in love with at first sight...

246
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:45,840
Yes.

247
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,860
Yet, you have no idea as to how you knew his name?

248
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,300
Yes. That's right.

249
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,260
So, what if Light-kun is Kira? Then what would you think?

250
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,050
Eh? If Light is Kira?

251
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,910
Eh? If Light is Kira?

252
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,010
Yes.

253
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,210
That'd be amazing.

254
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,670
Misa has always been really grateful to Kira for passing judgement on the murderer that killed Misa's parents.

255
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,370
If Light was Kira, I'd love him even more!

256
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,970
Although, I couldn't possibly love you more than I do now.

257
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,840
We're talking about Kira here... "I'd love him even more", don't you think that's scary?

258
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,480
We're talking about Kira here... "I'd love him even more", don't you think that's scary?

259
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,690
We're talking about if Light was Kira, right? That wouldn't be scary at all!

260
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,460
We're talking about if Light was Kira, right? That wouldn't be scary at all!

261
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:29,440
I'm a Kira supporter, so I would try to think up ways to help him, rather than be afraid.

262
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,240
You may get in his way, but I doubt that you'd be able to help him...

263
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:40,930
With this being the case, it's unmistakable that the second Kira is Misa-san, but...

264
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,450
it seems so obvious. Somehow I don't want to believe it.

265
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,510
You'd be correct not to believe it. 'Cause Misa is not Kira!

266
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,020
Anyway, we'll be placing you under surveillance.

267
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,440
When you want to go out, please contact us in this room by using the private line.

268
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,890
We've paid your agency so that from now on, whether it's at work or during your own personal time,

269
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,970
Matsuda-san can accompany you as your manager, Manager Matsui, at all times.

270
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,350
Hi, I'm Matsui. Yahoo!

271
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,970
The police have yet to be informed, so please ensure that you don't reveal this.

272
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,540
Hi, I'm Matsui. Yahoo!

273
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,800
I don't want this old man as my manager.

274
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,420
No way! What's so unsatisfactory about me, Misa-Misa?!

275
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,610
Talk of homos? Dates? Kisses? "Misa-Misa"?! Will you all kindly behave yourselves?!

276
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,070
Talk of homos? Dates? Kisses? "Misa-Misa"?! Will you all kindly behave yourselves?!

277
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,480
Talk of homos? Dates? Kisses? "Misa-Misa"?! Will you all kindly behave yourselves?!

278
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,470
Talk of homos? Dates? Kisses? "Misa-Misa"?! Will you all kindly behave yourselves?!

279
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,900
Talk of homos? Dates? Kisses? "Misa-Misa"?! Will you all kindly behave yourselves?!

280
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,270
This is about the Kira investigation! Will you take it seriously?!

281
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,630
This is about the Kira investigation! Will you take it seriously?!

282
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,030
S-Sorry...

283
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,970
S-Sorry...

284
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,610
No... I'm sorry, I know you're taking this seriously.

285
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,710
No... I'm sorry, I know you're taking this seriously.

286
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,810
No... I'm sorry, I know you're taking this seriously.

287
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,060
Come on, Amane, go to your own room.

288
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,800
Aaww...

289
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,890
Don't you "aaww" me.

290
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,000
Light! Even if it's got to be the three of us, let's go on a date, okay?

291
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,660
Light-kun, are you serious about Amane?

292
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,820
Erm, no. It's like I said before, it's kind of one-sided...

293
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,630
Well, could you please act as if you're serious about her?

294
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,910
Given the incident with the video tapes, it's clear that she has some sort of connection with the second Kira.

295
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,910
Also, it's clear that she loves you.

296
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,750
Are you telling me to get close to her so that we can find out about the second Kira?

297
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,980
Yes. I think you would be able to manage that.

298
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,310
Yes. I think you would be able to manage that.

299
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:15,380
Having you draw out the beginnings of an answer from Amane, was one of the main reasons I released both of you.

300
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,360
Ryuuzaki... even if it's for the sake of solving the Kira investigation,

301
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,840
Ryuuzaki... even if it's for the sake of solving the Kira investigation,

302
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,170
there's no way I can bring myself to use a girl's emotions like that.

303
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,380
I'm sorry, but please to try understand this.

304
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,320
For me, walking all over someone's goodwill is one of the worst things you can ever do, it's something that I can't forgive.

305
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,990
There's definitely something strange going on... I can only imagine that somehow, his personality changed.

306
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,470
There's definitely something strange going on... I can only imagine that somehow, his personality changed.

307
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,020
Is it even possible to just act like this?

308
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,540
I can only assume that not only was Amane Misa being manipulated by Kira, but so was Yagami Light.

309
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,290
I can only assume that not only was Amane Misa being manipulated by Kira, but so was Yagami Light.

310
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,230
What's wrong, Ryuuzaki?

311
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,260
Oh, nothing. You're right, Light-kun.

312
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,220
However, it'd help me a lot if you could ensure that she doesn't reveal anything about this investigation, given its secrecy.

313
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,290
Ryuuzaki, is it possible to change this system of moving hotels every few days?

314
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,140
Ryuuzaki, is it possible to change this system of moving hotels every few days?

315
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,150
Yes, I've been thinking about doing so since the start.

316
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:21,210
So, from the moment I met Yagami-san and the others, and decided to take this case, I commenced construction.

317
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,070
It'll be completed in a few days.

318
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,370
This is it.

319
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,200
Twenty-three floors high with two basement levels.

320
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,970
It's constructed in such a way that you can't observe the roof from the outside, and there are two helicopters housed within it.

321
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,990
Incredible!

322
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,570
As much as possible, I'd like everyone to live here.

323
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,170
Even if we choose to increase the number of people on the investigation, it can accommodate at least 60.

324
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,070
Surely Misa-san won't complain if we give her an entire floor.

325
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,160
At any rate, this is amazing! To have gone this far...

326
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,650
In fact, Ryuuzaki, where did you get the money for this?

327
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,870
I'll do whatever it takes to solve this case, that's what it means.

328
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,020
You didn't actually answer the question...

329
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,370
Yeah, you're right.

330
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,960
Of course, for being a mass murderer, and for what he's put my father and me through, I can't let Kira get away with this.

331
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,920
I'll do whatever it takes to solve this.

332
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,790
Well, if you'll "do whatever it takes", why don't you get close to Misa-san and try t--

333
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,760
No, not that. That's going against my honor.

334
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,320
Is that so? It's a pity...

335
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,430
Is that so? It's a pity...

336
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,260
Oh, nothing. I'm just getting really psyched about this.

337
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,400
Oh, nothing. I'm just getting really psyched about this.

338
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,600
Ryuuzaki, Yagami-san, Light-kun, let's ensure that we catch Kira, no matter what.

339
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,230
Ryuuzaki, Yagami-san, Light-kun, let's ensure that we catch Kira, no matter what.

340
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,370
Ryuuzaki, Yagami-san, Light-kun, let's ensure that we catch Kira, no matter what.

341
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,680
Ryuuzaki, Yagami-san, Light-kun, let's ensure that we catch Kira, no matter what.

342
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,500
Umm.. you didn't mention my name?

343
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,320
Looks like everyone is here.

344
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,590
Well, let's begin the meeting.

345
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:01,630
In order to further our company's activities and make Yotsuba the greatest enterprise in the world...

346
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,390
who do we need to kill?

347
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,880
Having someone killed every week is pretty serious.

348
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,110
But why has Kira moved from solely passing judgment on criminals to undertaking assassinations?

349
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,760
Takahashi, don't tell me you have yet to realize it?

350
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,950
It's because this will benefit Kira, of course.

351
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,650
Benefit Kira?

352
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,220
Are you telling me that Kira has become an assassin, Higuchi?

353
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,320
If I were you, I'd shut it more.

354
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,500
If you're too stupid, you could get killed.

355
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,650
All eight of us here are still young,

356
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,430
but it's rumored that all of us are capable of going for the company presidency in the near future.

357
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:45,560
In reality, since we started these meetings, out salaries have multiplied to several times the salary of a regular employee.

358
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,180
It just seems really strange to me that Kira would give their backing to a single enterprise.

359
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,940
However I think about it, it can only mean that out of the eight of us, one of us is... Kira.

360
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,200
However I think about it, it can only mean that out of the eight of us, one of us is... Kira.

361
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,160
However I think about it, it can only mean that out of the eight of us, one of us is... Kira.

362
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:08,240
Ooi Takeshi

363
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:08,240
Takahashi Eiichi

364
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:08,240
Kida Masahiko

365
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:08,240
Higuchi Kyosuke

366
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:08,240
Namikawa Reiji

367
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:08,240
Shimura Suguru

368
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:08,240
Misou Shino

369
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:08,240
Hatori Arayoshi

370
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,020
Getting back on topic, does anyone have any suggestions?

371
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,000
Who should we kill for our own profit?

372
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,840
Humans truly are... such ugly creatures...

373
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,750
Humans truly are... such ugly creatures...

374
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

375
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,320
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

376
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,320
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

377
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,450
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

378
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,450
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

379
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:39,230
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

380
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:39,230
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

381
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,010
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

382
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,010
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

383
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:51,080
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

384
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:51,080
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

385
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,220
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

386
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,220
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

387
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,870
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

388
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,870
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

389
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,030
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

390
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,030
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

391
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,510
I'm not so weak,

392
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,510
Samazama na negative ni

393
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,840
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

394
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,840
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

395
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,700
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

396
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,700
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

397
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,780
Preview

398
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,910
This is no good... the way you're talking, it sounds like you won't be satisfied unless I really am Kira.

399
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:39,010
This is no good... the way you're talking, it sounds like you won't be satisfied unless I really am Kira.

400
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,040
Don't fuck with me, Ryuuzaki!

401
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,960
Next Time

402
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,960
Ally
