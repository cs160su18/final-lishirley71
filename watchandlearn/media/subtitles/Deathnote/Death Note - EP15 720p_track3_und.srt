00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
I won't let anyone get in my way

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai kara

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
The recent past tells me of the future. My ideals become my dreams.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,140
kajitsu ga tsugeta mirai. Yume, visou ni kaeru

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
The ending that everyone desires.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Daremo ga nozonda owari wo...

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
In the shadows that keep expanding, we exchange revolutionary vows.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,600
Hirogaru yami no naka kawashiatta kakumei no chigiri

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
I won't let anyone get in my way

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,830
Dareni mo jama saseru wake ni wa ikanai

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Itsuka boku ga misete ageru hikari no kagayaku sekai wo

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:16,380
Someday I'll show you a world that shines in the light.

16
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,070
Light-kun... is the first friend I've ever had.

17
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,890
Light-kun... is the first friend I've ever had.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,210
Misa?

19
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,060
Yes?

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,400
Can you ask Rem to kill L?

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,240
Rem, I want to be loved by Light.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,740
Rem, I want to be loved by Light.

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,950
I'll be happy.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,080
Okay...

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,370
I'll kill L.

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,450
L is going to die... just like that?

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,590
L is going to die... just like that?

28
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,590
Gamble

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,640
So, when do you want him killed?

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,170
If you take me to him, I'll kill him instantly.

31
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,210
The earlier, the better.

32
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,690
It could even be tomorrow.

33
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,020
Then again, it may be a little careless to decide straight away.

34
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,260
Tonight, I'll think carefully about when and how we should kill him, and I'll give you my answer after that.

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,940
I understand.

36
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,800
Listen. No matter what happens, don't kill until I give the signal.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
Listen. No matter what happens, don't kill until I give the signal.

38
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,330
No matter what happens!

39
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,680
Sure, I can promise you that... with regard to L...

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Sure, I can promise you that... with regard to L...

41
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,020
Misa, give me your cell phone number.

42
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,980
You're rather slow on the uptake!

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,990
Give me yours too.

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,300
No, I can't give you mine.

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,470
Why?!

46
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,640
You can't do that when you're part of a couple!

47
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,420
I already told you, I'm being marked by the police.

48
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,020
These days, they have the ability to bug specific telephone lines.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,020
Oh! In that case, have this!

50
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,150
Misa will give you one of hers!

51
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,680
After I started to use each for a different purpose, I ended up with three!

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,070
It's a good idea.

53
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,990
Yours should probably be fine.

54
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,920
Yay! I'll give you a love call every day!

55
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,120
And send you lots of texts!

56
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,670
No, I'll be leaving the phone switched off.

57
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,830
I'll call you only when necessary, and ensure that information is kept to a minimum.

58
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,470
No way... when will you call me?

59
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,420
No way... when will you call me?

60
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,080
Probably tomorrow.

61
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,920
Regardless of whether we go ahead with killing L or not, I'll give you a call.

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,530
Yay! Tomorrow?!

63
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,640
Doesn't sound like the call is going to be very romantic, but if we can talk love afterwards, I don't mind!

64
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,670
Anyway, Misa, you'd better go home now.

65
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,210
Oh, what?! It's only 7 pm!

66
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,150
The time for lovers has only just begun!

67
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,030
We can go grab something to eat together, and follow that by watching the sun set, and then it'll be time to get serious!

68
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,240
Misa.

69
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,090
Okay?

70
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,020
For today, go home.

71
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,840
...Okay.

72
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,970
Also, when you talk to Rem outside, make sure no one is around, and do so quietly.

73
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,110
I do the same with Ryuk.

74
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,810
Okay...

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,370
Thank you for having me...

76
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,830
Misa-san! Please come again tomorrow!

77
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,840
I was pretty surprised when you just kissed her out of nowhere.

78
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,580
It's necessary to ensure that Misa falls utterly in love with me.

79
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,200
Oh...

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,830
More importantly, I need to decide whether or not to kill L tomorrow.

81
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:40,750
Since Ryuuga's identity as L isn't publicly known, I've got to be prepared for the fact that if he dies, I will be strongly suspected of being Kira.

82
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,800
Aah, I see.

83
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,970
I thought that since you declared yourselves to be friends, you might be having second thoughts about killing him.

84
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,930
"Friends"?

85
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,930
I just went along with what he said.

86
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,310
From the beginning I've said, "if he wants friendship, I'll take it".

87
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,020
For Yagami Light, Ryuuga is merely a friend for appearance's sake.

88
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
L is Kira's enemy.

89
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,290
That's right. L is my enemy.

90
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,370
Since he's revealed himself to me as L, I'll have to kill him...

91
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:24,630
If I make it an "accidental death", hardly anyone will suspect that I'm Kira, and even if they do, there'll be no proof.

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,260
I can only imagine what will happen after L dies... this is now a gamble.

93
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,060
I can only imagine what will happen after L dies... this is now a gamble.

94
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:39,220
Tomorrow, L... or rather Ryuuzaki or Ryuuga, will be your last.

95
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,070
Hair.

96
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,000
Crumbs from snacks.

97
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,510
Hair.

98
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,230
Yagami-san?

99
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,640
If I die in the next few days, your son is Kira.

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,770
Hair again.

101
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,750
What did you just say, Ryuuzaki?!

102
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,050
That's right! Where's this suddenly coming from?

103
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,340
I'll arrange it so that you can use Watari as you please.

104
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,930
The rest will be up to you.

105
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,260
Ryuuzaki! You said that the majority of your suspicions had already been dismissed!

106
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,860
How deeply do you really suspect my son?!

107
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,270
I'm not sure I really understand what I truly think myself.

108
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,010
Nothing like this has ever happened before...

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,380
If Kira and the second kira have indeed made contact... I'm in a dire pinch.

110
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,290
If Kira and the second kira have indeed made contact... I'm in a dire pinch.

111
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,040
Thus, right now, I'm probably incapable of calmly analyzing myself.

112
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,860
I could be doing this solely because I have no other suspects.

113
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,190
Nevertheless, if I am killed now, please conclude that your son is Kira.

114
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,280
Nevertheless, if I am killed now, please conclude that your son is Kira.

115
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,760
Nevertheless, if I am killed now, please conclude that your son is Kira.

116
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,940
I'll have to make another surprise attack, but it can't be helped... this is now a gamble.

117
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,280
I'll have to make another surprise attack, but it can't be helped... this is now a gamble.

118
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,620
That's not true, I'm just pretty sharp.

119
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,000
What's wrong?

120
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,950
Ah! Yagami-kun... hi.

121
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,490
Ah! Yagami-kun... hi.

122
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,720
Ah! Yagami-kun... hi.

123
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,350
Takada-san, I'd like to speak to him alone for a bit.

124
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,350
I'll see you later.

125
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,220
Huh? Okay...

126
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,000
Huh? Okay...

127
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,330
Sure this is okay? What about her?

128
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,460
Never mind that. You said you were "scared of showing your face in public", are you okay?

129
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,790
Yagami-kun, I realized I'd be fine as long as you're not Kira.

130
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,290
Outside, you're the only one who knows I'm L.

131
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,380
That's why, if I'm killed within the next few days... you are Kira. I've informed everyone at Headquarters of that fact.

132
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,220
That's why, if I'm killed within the next few days... you are Kira. I've informed everyone at Headquarters of that fact.

133
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,050
That's why, if I'm killed within the next few days... you are Kira. I've informed everyone at Headquarters of that fact.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,600
You!

135
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,210
You said yourself that it's lonely without me around, so I thought I'd come in for a change of scenery.

136
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,220
You said yourself that it's lonely without me around, so I thought I'd come in for a change of scenery.

137
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,520
As long as I don't die, university is fun.

138
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,760
Yeah, when you're not around, there's no one I can talk to at my level. It's boring.

139
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,070
Yeah, when you're not around, there's no one I can talk to at my level. It's boring.

140
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,450
And thus the talented Takada-san?

141
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,330
Well, something like that.

142
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,330
Will it really be safe to kill him today?

143
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:50,470
No, by non-chalantly turning up like this, he's just trying to break my will to kill him.

144
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,760
He's probably trying to warn me off.

145
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,870
This is just what he wants to happen...

146
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,000
Shall we grab some cake from the cafeteria?

147
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,350
Yeah, I got no lectures next period.

148
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,850
That's good.

149
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,800
I wonder if they have shortcake?

150
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,990
Don't know, I can't remember.

151
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,360
Light! There you are!

152
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,740
I had a shoot nearby, so I thought I'd drop by!

153
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,050
Misa... you idiot!

154
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,990
Misa... you idiot!

155
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,850
Light, one of your friends?

156
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,370
Wow, he's wonderfully unique, isn't he...

157
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,580
No wait... I've won!

158
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,800
Misa can see Ryuuga's real name!

159
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,670
I'm Light's girlfriend, Amane Misa. Nice to meet you.

160
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,010
I'm Ryuuga Hideki.

161
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,130
Huh? Ryuuga Hideki?

162
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,930
Yeah, he's got the same name as the idol. Funny, huh?

163
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,570
But... that's different from the name I can see...

164
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,850
Ryuuga, this time, your decision to come out has worked against y--!

165
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,560
Ryuuga, this time, your decision to come out has worked against y--!

166
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,490
What's he laughing about?!

167
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,910
Don't tell me, he's realized?!

168
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,250
But if he thinks there's a possibility that she's the second Kira, surely he wouldn't be able to laugh like that...

169
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,250
Yagami-kun...

170
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,590
I'm very jealous.

171
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,530
I've been a fan of Misa's since the August edition of "Eighteen".

172
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,800
Yay! Really?! I'm happy!

173
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,290
That girl, it's Misa-Misa, isn't it?!

174
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,450
You're right! It is Misa-Misa!

175
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,120
Eh?! Misa-Misa?!

176
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,010
Eh?! Really?!

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,770
I always seem to get noticed when there's lots of young people around!

178
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,770
Where?! Wow!

179
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,770
Wow! Really?!

180
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,510
I buy your stuff every month!

181
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,890
Please keep up the good work!

182
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,270
Thanks, I'll try my best.

183
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,110
What's going on here?

184
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,700
No! Someone just touched my butt!

185
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,950
What nerve! To take advantage of all this confusion to do something like that!

186
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,520
I'll find the culprit!

187
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,480
Ryuuga-san, you're so funny!

188
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,380
I wanna feel too.

189
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,380
Dumb-ass...

190
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,590
I want to find out L's real name from Misa as soon as possible, but with all these people around...

191
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,710
Misa! It's time to go.

192
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,960
Misa! It's time to go.

193
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,350
Do you want to be late, again?

194
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,260
Sorry, Yoshii.

195
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,490
Let's go.

196
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,680
No matter.

197
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,230
Even if Misa leaves, all I need to do is make one phone call to find out.

198
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,690
Bye Light! See you after work!

199
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,130
Well then, shall we go, Yagami-kun?

200
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,540
Yeah.

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You go ahead, I need to go to the toilet.

202
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,430
Really? Okay then.

203
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,770
It's over.

204
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,650
It's been all sorts of fun, L.

205
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,150
I'm so glad I was able to find out your real name and kill you myself.

206
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,960
It's been all sorts of fun, L.

207
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,880
I'm so glad I was able to find out your real name and kill you myself.

208
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,010
Yes, hello?

209
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,330
What do you mean, "Hello"?

210
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,670
It looks like someone dropped this phone amid all the confusion just now.

211
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,420
At that time... he...

212
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,120
Hello?

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,810
That's Misa's phone. I'll return it to her.

214
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,180
Really? Okay, got it.

215
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,920
Ryuuga, you may think you've outwitted me, but Misa has another cell phone.

216
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,510
Ryuuga, you may think you've outwitted me, but Misa has another cell phone.

217
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,030
Ryuuga, you may think you've outwitted me, but Misa has another cell phone.

218
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,780
Once I ring that...

219
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,020
This time it's my cell phone.

220
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,330
Yes?

221
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,000
Ah, is that right. We've done it, then.

222
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,150
Understood.

223
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,090
This is probably both good and bad news for you.

224
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,100
We've apprehended Amane Misa on suspicion of being the second Kira.

225
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,020
Since when has he suspected Misa?!

226
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,420
I can't believe she was caught so fast...

227
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,350
When the second Kira sent the video tapes from Amane's room, they left a great deal of evidence, such as hairs and clothing fibres, stuck to packing tape used to seal the envelopes.

228
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:11,660
When the second Kira sent the video tapes from Amane's room, they left a great deal of evidence, such as hairs and clothing fibres, stuck to packing tape used to seal the envelopes.

229
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,660
We believe that announcing she's under suspicion of being the second Kira would cause public chaos,

230
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,330
so we're saying she's gone to be questioned about the charges held against her manager for drug possession.

231
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,010
However, I doubt the public will find that out.

232
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,200
I was too naive.

233
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,510
Those videos... I should have ensure I destroyed the evidence.

234
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,140
Those videos... I should have ensure I destroyed the evidence.

235
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:39,690
In the end, by being around me, rather than hiding, Ryuuga managed to protect himself, and get right to the heart of the case...

236
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,190
This gamble... I've...

237
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,990
I've...

238
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,030
I've...

239
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,160
No!

240
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,290
It's not over yet.

241
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,710
The fight has just begun, L.

242
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,270
Watari, has she said anything yet?

243
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,730
No, not a word.

244
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,550
Bring a visual of her up.

245
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,010
Are you sure?

246
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,220
Yes, hurry up.

247
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:24,960
R-Ryuuzaki... what the hell is this?!

248
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,250
R-Ryuuzaki... what the hell is this?!

249
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,230
R-Ryuuzaki... what the hell is this?!

250
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,680
She's been apprehended on suspicion of being the second Kira.

251
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,410
It's only natural to take these precautions.

252
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,990
It's true that there was enough evidence in Amane's room to assure us that she's the second Kira...

253
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,510
Yes, there's no doubt.

254
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,000
Now, we need a confession of how she kill people, if she knows Kira, and if she knows who Kira is.

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,290
Now, we need a confession of how she kill people, if she knows Kira, and if she knows who Kira is.

256
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,340
Now, we need a confession of how she kill people, if she knows Kira, and if she knows who Kira is.

257
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,820
Watari, as long as you're careful, I won't mind if you use slightly dubious methods.

258
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,760
Watari, as long as you're careful, I won't mind if you use slightly dubious methods.

259
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,360
Get her to spit it out.

260
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,270
Okay.

261
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,280
And, Yagami-san, please prepare yourself for the fact that I'll be bringing Light-kun in for questioning regarding Kira.

262
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,610
And, Yagami-san, please prepare yourself for the fact that I'll be bringing Light-kun in for questioning regarding Kira.

263
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,120
Ryuuzaki! Amane has said something.

264
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,590
Ryuuzaki! Amane has said something.

265
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,420
Hurry and bring up a visual.

266
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,010
Finally! After three days.

267
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,310
I can't stand it anymore...

268
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,700
Kill me.

269
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,350
Kill me! Hurry up and kill me.

270
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,750
Kill me! Hurry up and kill me.

271
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,930
I thought it might have been too much for a girl who's only around twenty.

272
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,490
This must be her limit.

273
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,870
Amane Misa, can you hear me?

274
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,980
Amane Misa, can you hear me?

275
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,780
I can hear you.

276
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,720
Please... hurry up and kill me.

277
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,100
Please... hurry up and kill me.

278
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,660
Does that mean that you admit you are the second Kira?

279
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,630
No. I don't know anything about the second Kira...

280
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,590
No. I don't know anything about the second Kira...

281
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,930
I can't take this anymore... I'd rather die.

282
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,950
I can't take this anymore... I'd rather die.

283
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,720
Come on! Hurry up and kill me!

284
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,140
I know you could kill me in an instant if you wanted to!

285
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,570
Misa... you don't mean...

286
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,550
Misa... you don't mean...

287
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,690
That's right, kill me...

288
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,300
...you want me to kill you?

289
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,780
Yes, kill me.

290
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,580
I can't endure this anymore, kill me.

291
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,810
If I kill you, I'll kill Yagami Light too.

292
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,500
This is all his faul--

293
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,690
No! No!

294
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,250
Kill me.

295
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,000
Misa... you're really willing to die for him?

296
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,240
That's enough! If you won't kill me I--

297
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,720
That's enough! If you won't kill me I--

298
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,390
Oh no!

299
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,930
Watari! Don't let her bite her tongue!

300
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,150
Surely, she's not being manipulated by Kira just before she dies?

301
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,770
Hey Rem, what do you want all of a sudden?

302
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,400
Hey Rem, what do you want all of a sudden?

303
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,930
Yagami Light, even though I offered to help Misa escape, she refused.

304
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,660
Yagami Light, even though I offered to help Misa escape, she refused.

305
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,500
It's probably because she realized that she would be seen as having special powers, which would cause you trouble...

306
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,300
And when she realized she was reaching the limits of her mentality, she began to ask for me to kill her.

307
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,000
And when she realized she was reaching the limits of her mentality, she began to ask for me to kill her.

308
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,510
All this, because she wants to be loved by you.

309
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,550
All this, because she wants to be loved by you.

310
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,190
Even though she begged me to, there's no way I could kill Misa.

311
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,540
I couldn't bear to watch her suffer like that.

312
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,670
There's only one way to save her.

313
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,010
Forfeiting ownership of the Death Note?

314
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,610
That's right.

315
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,050
Once you forfeit ownership of a Death Note, all the memories you have of it disappears completely.

316
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,660
Once you forfeit ownership of a Death Note, all the memories you have of it disappears completely.

317
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,420
She would forget about all the people she's killed, and the fact that Yagami Light is Kira.

318
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,340
She would forget about all the people she's killed, and the fact that Yagami Light is Kira.

319
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,630
So, there would be no danger of her giving away your secret.

320
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,010
Also, she would no longer be able to see Ryuk or myself.

321
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,350
A few hours earlier

322
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,350
Misa, this means that you'll forget everything you know about Shinigami.

323
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,060
Misa, this means that you'll forget everything you know about Shinigami.

324
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,480
It's okay.

325
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,760
The human you love is Yagami Light. Those feelings alone will remain.

326
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,030
The human you love is Yagami Light. Those feelings alone will remain.

327
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:51,420
That is why you should give up ownership of your Death Note and entrust everything to Yagami Light.

328
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,850
Misa is no longer the owner of a Death Note.

329
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,210
Good work, Rem.

330
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,670
I was just thinking that that was our sole option.

331
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,640
If Misa has no memory of the Death Note, it's possible that she can be released.

332
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,550
If Misa has no memory of the Death Note, it's possible that she can be released.

333
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,590
Yagami Light, I knew that this would be the best option for you, which is why I suggested it to Misa.

334
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,750
Yagami Light, I knew that this would be the best option for you, which is why I suggested it to Misa.

335
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,470
Yagami Light, I knew that this would be the best option for you, which is why I suggested it to Misa.

336
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,710
If you don't save Misa, I will kill you.

337
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,450
If you don't save Misa, I will kill you.

338
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,240
I understand, Rem.

339
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,460
I've got a fair idea of what L might do from here, and I have a plan.

340
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,240
I've got a fair idea of what L might do from here, and I have a plan.

341
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,000
This is goodbye, Ryuk.

342
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,520
Huh?

343
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

344
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,340
Darenimo mirenai yume wo mita

345
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,340
I've had dreams that no one else could have.

346
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,470
Iranai mono wa subete suteta

347
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,470
I've thrown away everything that I don't need.

348
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:39,250
Those feelings I can't rid remain in my heart.

349
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:39,250
Yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

350
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,030
Even though I'm stuck between ideals and reality,

351
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,030
Mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

352
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,100
and my legs are bound by the shackles of sacrifice.

353
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,100
Gesei no kase ni, ashi wo toraretemo

354
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,240
If I can hold back these overwhelming urges,

355
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,240
Afureru shoudou osaekireba

356
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,890
Tsuyoku motomeru kokora ga arukara

357
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,890
I still have a soul that yearns for more.

358
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,050
Itsuwari, Osore, Kyoshoku, Urei

359
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,050
Lies, fear, pretension, grief.

360
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,530
Samazama na negative ni

361
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,530
I'm not so weak,

362
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,860
Torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai

363
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,860
that I'll become lost in these negative feelings.

364
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,720
A trickster that doesn't know loneliness.

365
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,720
Kodoku mo shiranu trickster

366
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,490
Preview

367
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,550
Right now, I know I'm in a bad situation, but meaningless pride like that... I discard it!

368
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,920
Right now, I know I'm in a bad situation, but meaningless pride like that... I discard it!

369
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,840
Right now, I know I'm in a bad situation, but meaningless pride like that... I discard it!

370
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,790
Next time

371
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,790
Decision
