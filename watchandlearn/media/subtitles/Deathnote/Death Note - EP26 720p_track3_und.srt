00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,590

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,490

94
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,350
Huh?! W-What's happening?!

95
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,580
Everyone, the Shiniga--

96
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:39,990
Everyone, the Shiniga--

97
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,970
Reincarnation

98
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,970
Go on! Kill me!

99
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,390
Go on! Kill me!

100
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,100
We lied about this being a live worldwide broadcast.

101
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,610
This announcement is currently being broadcast across the Kanto region of Japan.

102
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,950
Your first victim was, in fact, the Phantom Killer in Shinjuku.

103
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,530
In addition, that incident was only reported within Japan.

104
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,990
We've just heard that the culprit was found dead in the nursery!

105
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,530
Yes, it looks like the culprit is dead!

106
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,780
Just those pieces of information were enough for me to figure it out.

107
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:31,080
It means that you are in Japan, and that that criminal was your first "experiment".

108
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,750
The Investigative Headquarters for Countermeasures Against Kira

109
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,390
Kira is able to access confidential police files.

110
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,640
There are 141 people within the police who have access to information regarding Kira.

111
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,890
But within the 141 people or people close to them... Kira will definitely be among them.

112
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,650
But within the 141 people or people close to them... Kira will definitely be among them.

113
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,940
FBI investigation into those connected to the Japanese Police Force.

114
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,070
On the 14th of December, twelve FBI agents entered Japan.

115
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,970
On the 19th of December,

116
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,710
Kira is evidently using prisoners as test subjects in order to study how they could manipulate the victims' movements before death.

117
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,540
Don't move!

118
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,310
From this we can deduct that to kill the FBI agents, Kira found it necessary to experiment to see how far they could manipulate someone's death.

119
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,290
Everyone, get down!

120
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:26,390
Consequently, Kira must be someone that was under investigation by the FBI between the 14th and the 19th.

121
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,850
An important witness:
Misora Naomi

122
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,560
Ray Penber's fiancée?

123
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,760
Misora Naomi...

124
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,700
I see... the girl who worked for me on that case... in Japan...

125
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,200
Apparently she was with Penber.

126
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,710
She might have discovered something...

127
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,910
So, does this mean Kira beat me to it?

128
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,130
Yagami Light

129
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,390
Everyone. From now on, we'll only be investigating those people who were under surveillance by Ray Penber.

130
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,020
The subjects of our investigation will be Deputy Kitamura and his family, and Chief Yagami and his family.

131
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,160
I'd also like to be able to set up cameras and bugging devices in both households.

132
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,100
Ryuuzaki, don't tell me... you actually suspect my son?!

133
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,030
Ryuuzaki, don't tell me... you actually suspect my son?!

134
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,950
Oh, I definitely suspect him, alright.

135
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,910
Contact with Yagami Light

136
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,660
I'm L.

137
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,210
Relax, Yagami.

138
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,220
Although Kira hates to lose, the majority of people would want to win in a match, whether they're Kira or not.

139
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,760
See. I knew you'd want to win.

140
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,350
I suspect that you may be Kira, Yagami-kun.

141
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,990
Me, Kira?

142
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,340
Ryuuga... is there any way that I can prove to you that I'm not Kira?

143
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,690
It'll be alright.

144
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,080
If you aren't Kira, I'll find out sooner or later.

145
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,130
Murder cases
involving a TV channel
co-operating with Kira

146
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,340
Four days ago, the director on duty received these four tapes.

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,110
Our ratings will rise by 60.. no, 70% at least!

148
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:30,680
...further predictions to provide proof that they are Kira, but also a message to the people of the world:

149
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,850
I am Kira.

150
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,540
The anchorman, Hibima Kazuhiko, will die of a heart attack at exactly 6 o'clock.

151
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,060
We've got to stop this broadcast, or there'll be trouble!

152
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,860
Idiots!

153
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,530
Ukita-san!

154
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,860
If Kira doesn't have a name, they shouldn't be able to kill!

155
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,610
Having watched this, it seems that the probability of Kira being able to kill someone solely by knowing their face isn't zero.

156
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,080
Police! Stop the broadcast!

157
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,250
The probability of this Kira being a fake is extremely high.

158
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,170
No, a "second Kira" is probably a better description.

159
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,430
Yagami-san, would it be okay if we asked your son to help us in the investigation?

160
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,600
Yagami Light summoned
to the Investigative Headquarters

161
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,270
If nothing else, there's a high probability that this is not the same Kira that we've been dealing with previously.

162
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,060
The same as L... I mean, that's exactly the same theory as Ryuuzaki!

163
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,480
When we meet, we can confirm our identities by showing each other our Shinigami.

164
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,070
What?!

165
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:37,000
If they're using a code that only those with a Shinigami's power would understand, then I won't be able to break it.

166
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,670
But... we'll need to ensure that we keep a close surveillance on all the locations mentioned.

167
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,210
I need you to observe Light-kun carefully during those two days as well.

168
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,980
If, by any chance he really is Kira, the second Kira may attempt to approach him in some way.

169
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,730
And Yagami-san... have Mogi-san keep a close eye on Light-kun's movements.

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,430
Light!

171
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,940
The arrest of Amane Misa on suspicion of being the second Kira

172
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,480
Light! There you are!

173
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,140
I'm Light's girlfriend, Amane Misa.

174
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,270
Pleased to meet you!

175
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,150
I'm Ryuuga Hideki.

176
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,570
Huh? Ryuuga Hideki?

177
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,040
This is probably both good and bad news for you...

178
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,520
We've apprehended Amane Misa on suspicion of being the second Kira.

179
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,410
When the second Kira sent the video tapes from Amane's room,

180
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,550
they left a great deal of evidence, such as hairs and clothing fibres stuck to packing tape used to seal the envelopes.

181
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,550
Amane Misa's detention

182
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,210
R-Ryuuzaki... what the hell is this?!

183
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,420
R-Ryuuzaki... what the hell is this?!

184
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,860
R-Ryuuzaki... what the hell is this?!

185
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,810
Come on! Hurry up and kill me!

186
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,280
I know you could kill me in an instant if you wanted to!

187
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,980
Does that mean that you admit you are the second Kira?

188
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,820
No! I don't know anything about the second Kira!

189
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,030
The voluntary detention of Yagami Light

190
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,200
Ryuuzaki, it's as I said on the phone... I might be Kira.

191
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,910
You're saying "I might be Kira"...

192
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,740
It's an act.

193
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,410
It's not that you "might be" Kira; you are Kira.

194
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,100
Light-kun, are you okay?

195
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,530
Yeah.

196
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,170
I can't say that I look too good at the moment... but such meaningless pride...

197
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,260
I discard it.

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:21,350
Ryuuzaki! I know I chose to be imprisoned and go through with this, but I've just realized, I am not Kira!

199
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,060
Hurry up and let me out of here!

200
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,640
What's going on?!

201
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,690
Two weeks' worth of criminals were taken out in one shot yesterday!

202
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,130
I have no idea what's going on...

203
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,490
Release of the two

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,140
It seems like all three of them are reaching their limits.

205
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,040
Ryuuzaki, why do you continue to detain Light-kun?! It's already been fifty days!

206
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,450
I'm going to kill you here and then I'll kill myself.

207
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,200
What are you saying, father?! Don't be stupid!

208
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,810
Stop it! Dad! You're crazy!!

209
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,090
It's better to run!

210
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,960
It's too late, Light.

211
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,840
Stop it, father! I'm not Kira!!

212
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,810
Light... we're both murderers; see you in hell.

213
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,720
Light... we're both murderers; see you in hell.

214
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,510
Father!

215
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,520
Stop!!

216
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,500
It was a very realistic performance.

217
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,360
As promised, I'll end their imprisonment.

218
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Yagami Light, summoned again under
the pretext of helping with the investigation

219
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:23,750
Also Light-kun, as promised, I'm prepared to make a pact with you; that is, you'll be with me 24/7 assisting me with this investigation.

220
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,540
Yotsuba

221
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,300
These are deaths that have benefited Yotsuba.

222
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,590
If you dig a little deeper, there have been thirteen incidents over the last three months.

223
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,640
The infiltration of Yotsuba

224
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,640
Is Kira a part of Yotsuba? Is Kira merely using Yotsuba?

225
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,020
Is Kira a part of Yotsuba? Is Kira merely using Yotsuba?

226
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,600
I've got no idea which it is, but we can assume that Kira is behind this.

227
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,850
It's time that we investigate Yotsuba thoroughly.

228
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
Please, think ahead carefully before you act, and don't do anything rash.

229
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
Don't just act on your own judgments.

230
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,450
I-I'm Matsui Tarou, a manager at Yoshida Productions.

231
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,740
How would you like to hire our star, Amane Misa, for your commercials?

232
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,780
Ryuuzaki, can you see me?

233
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,220
The eight that are here were in a meeting together, planning who to have Kira murder.

234
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,370
If Matsuda-san dies now, it will confirm the suspicions surrounding Yotsuba.

235
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,620
Is there really no way to save me?

236
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,340
Matsuda, you idiot!

237
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,920
The conclusion that
Higuchi Kyousuke is Kira

238
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,840
Go for it, Misa-Misa!!

239
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,120
I'll go and prepare the celebrations for when you land this commercial!

240
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,060
Misa's dream is to become Kira's wife!

241
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,270
That's because Misa is... the second Kira.

242
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,480
Well, since I'm Kira, you'd better marry me, Misa-chan!

243
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,070
So, as you can all hear... Higuchi is Kira!

244
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,770
Higuchi's capture

245
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,780
What are you planning?

246
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,610
I'm going to use Sakura TV to trap Higuchi.

247
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,950
You mean Dokkiri TV?!

248
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,330
Higuchi, this looks bad. Turn on your TV.

249
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,560
And one of those is Kira, is that right?

250
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,920
Yes, and I have plenty of proof!

251
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,130
It's him! Why is he still alive?

252
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,720
Higuchi's status confirmed. I'm in pursuit.

253
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,560
We're going after him!

254
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,710
You in the Porsche! Stop!

255
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,150
Pull over to the side! Stop the car!

256
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,190
Rem, it's time to do the deal.

257
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,190
"Deal"?

258
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,330
You were speeding. Let's see your license.

259
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,860
Ah, alright then.

260
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,590
He managed to shake off the cop! He's getting away!

261
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,910
This is the Traffic Riot Police--

262
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,590
Everyone! I believe it will be too dangerous to allow Higuchi to act any further!

263
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,170
We're going ahead with his capture.

264
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,390
However, Higuchi is now able to kill just by looking at someone's face, similar to the second Kira.

265
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,060
We'll be making the arrest under that assumption!

266
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
It ends here.

267
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,360
Stay back! No one come near!

268
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,030
Higuchi captured

269
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,290
Higuchi, how were you killing people?

270
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:12,080
You probably won't believe me, but if you write the name of a person whose face you know in that notebook, that person will die.

271
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,120
I found it in his bag.

272
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,500
What's wrong, Yagami-san?

273
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,590
M-Monster!

274
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,390
A Shinigami...

275
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,720
More than one notebook exists.

276
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,640
It's not over yet...

277
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,730
The Notebook of Death,
and the analysis of its rules

278
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,130
"How to use"...

279
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,030
"The human whose name is written in this note shall die."

280
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,860
And this final sentence...

281
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:55,440
"From the moment a new user writes a name into this notebook, they must continue to write names, each within 13 days of the last; otherwise, the user will die."

282
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,660
Yagami Light and Amane Misa are still alive...

283
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,010
13 days... this is the only thing...

284
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,470
Ryuuzaki has been dead for ten days now; seems like we've managed to avoid being killed.

285
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,440
Ryuuzaki has been dead for ten days now; seems like we've managed to avoid being killed.

286
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,620
We've managed to find a little about Watari's true identity, but we've found nothing about Ryuuzaki.

287
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,880
However, Watari turned out to be an incredible inventor, didn't he?

288
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,330
"He established orphanages all over the world using the fortune he made from his patents."

289
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,500
He was a great man! A great man.

290
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,870
However, with L and Watari gone, we can't continue our investigations from here. It's tough.

291
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,960
However, with L and Watari gone, we can't continue our investigations from here. It's tough.

292
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,980
However, with L and Watari gone, we can't continue our investigations from here. It's tough.

293
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,010
However, with L and Watari gone, we can't continue our investigations from here. It's tough.

294
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,230
Light? How's it going?

295
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,880
Light? How's it going?

296
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,330
We should be able to remove and take most of the system with us by tonight.

297
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,890
It doesn't feel good doing this though, it's like being a thief.

298
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,150
I've managed to create a voice identical to the one Ryuuzaki was using;

299
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,360
we'll be able to make it seem like he's still alive, and we can control the world's police forces just as before.

300
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,490
However, I don't know who'll take L's place or where... or what we're supposed to do with this murderer's notebook.

301
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,380
What are you talking about, Light-kun? The only one who can take on the role of L is you.

302
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,330
What are you talking about, Light-kun? The only one who can take on the role of L is you.

303
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:04,920
If Ryuuzaki died as a result of provoking Kira, it's not exactly a tempting position.

304
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,930
Besides, it means we're deceiving the entire world.

305
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,540
I understand how you feel, Light-kun, but besides you, there's no one else.

306
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,430
He's right. Even L said, "Light-kun would be able to succeed me".

307
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,450
So easy... just as I predicted, without Ryuuzaki around, it's so easy.

308
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,730
So easy... just as I predicted, without Ryuuzaki around, it's so easy.

309
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,270
Fine, I'll do it.

310
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:37,040
But unlike Ryuuzaki, I won't be using any dangerous methods such as challenging Kira in order to gain hints.

311
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,250
As long as you're all okay with that...

312
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,020
Yes. It's probably better to err on the side of caution.

313
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,640
Ryuuzaki was probably a little too confrontational.

314
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:53,310
In that case, I can manage with just this PC and my own, so it'll be possible for me to act as L from my own room at home.

315
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,940
I'll act as Watari as well.

316
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,600
But it's going to be rather difficult with my mother and sister around.

317
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,770
It'd be useful if I could rent a single room somewhere.

318
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll give you an allowance to live on your own. No one will find that odd.

319
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:14,910
Yeah, you're right. Well, from now on, Light-kun's room will be the new investigative headquarters.

320
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,300
Now all that's left is to decide what to do with the murderer's notebook.

321
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,870
We won't need to think too hard about that either.

322
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:28,420
We just need to keep it in an unknown location. So have one of us five, someone we trust will never use it, hide it somewhere.

323
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,390
Chief, please do it.

324
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,760
The Chief can definitely do it. He's full of righteousness.

325
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,710
Me? Okay then.

326
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,640
Me? Okay then.

327
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,090
Let's avenge Ryuuzaki!

328
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,480
Kira is still on the loose. We must catch them!

329
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,490
Well, why don't we hold a party to celebrate Light-kun becoming the second L?

330
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,630
Light! This is our first date in a while, you could at least try to look a little happier!

331
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,440
Misa.

332
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,560
Let's live together.

333
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,180
R-Really?

334
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,880
Yeah, I've already rented an apartment.

335
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,250
Yay! We're going to live together!

336
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,760
Misa wins!!

337
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,820
Wins?

338
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,940
Over Kiyomi, Mari, Yuri and so on...

339
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:40,530
It's okay, Light. I understood that you were just using them to deceive L.

340
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,120
You won't be seeing them anymore, will you?

341
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,670
Yeah, I won't.

342
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,420
So, you've completely settled the score with L, eh?

343
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,930
Yeah.

344
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,180
Guess I won't have much fun to look forward to then.

345
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,900
That's not true at all, Ryuk.

346
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,290
From here on... I'm going to show you the reincarnation of a new world.

347
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,660
From here on... I'm going to show you the reincarnation of a new world.

348
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,390
Papa?

349
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,560
Papa?!

350
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,840
The reconstruction of Yotsuba begins now.

351
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,240
Y-Yes, let's do our best.

352
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Y-Yes, let's do our best.

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,060
Y-Yes, let's do our best.

354
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,920
Hey? Namikawa?!

355
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,450
Hey? Namikawa?!

356
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,400
S-Surely not...

357
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,980
S-Surely not...

358
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,990
April 2012: Yagami Light, aged 23, joins the National Police Force.

359
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,800
April 2012: Yagami Light, aged 23, joins the National Police Force.

360
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,800
Summer 2012: The rate of Kira's judgment increases even more rapidly.

361
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,900
Summer 2012: The rate of Kira's judgment increases even more rapidly.

362
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,810
The world becomes split into two groups: those that scream in fear at Kira, and those that secretly cheer him on.

363
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,420
Little by little, those voices in support of Kira begin to surface.

364
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,580
Eventually, entire countries begin to declare their acceptance of Kira's work,

365
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,460
and the world continues to head toward a dark age, where Kira is law.

366
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,010
What's up, Roger?

367
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,470
L... has died.

368
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,540
L... has died.

369
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

370
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,420
This one page of everlasting depression;

371
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,420
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

372
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,010
hakanai senpou sono meni

373
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,010
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

374
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,280
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

375
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,280
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

376
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,860
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

377
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,860
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

378
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,510
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

379
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,510
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

380
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,360
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

381
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,360
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

382
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,800
Who would know of a path to salvation?

383
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,800
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

384
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,650
Menzai no waarudo

385
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,650
World of acquittal,

386
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,480
seisai no waado

387
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,480
words of retribution!

388
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,220
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

389
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,220
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

390
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,210
Redeem the game of law!

391
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,210
Aganau houritsu geemu

392
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,240
Despair the Billy,

relentless eraser rain.

Preview

407
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,290
L's death... who... where... did they hear this from?

408
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,330
L's death... who... where... did they hear this from?

409
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,360
L's death... who... where... did they hear this from?

410
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,750
L's death... who... where... did they hear this from?

411
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,090
Is this a joke?!

412
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,580
But... what is this... presence?

413
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,100
But... what is this... presence?

414
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,250
But... what is this... presence?

415
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,960
Next Time

416
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,960
Abduction
