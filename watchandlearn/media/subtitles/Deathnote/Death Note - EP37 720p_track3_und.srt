Since you first wrote down a name, how much time has passed?

93
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,800
35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,540
35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

97
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,160
35... 36... 37... 38... 39...

98
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,190
Near, it's my victory!

99
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,250
Near, it's my victory!

100
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,880
40!!

101
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,260
New World

102
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,990
We didn't die...

103
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,320
One minute has passed... and we didn't die!

104
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,240
One minute has passed... and we didn't die!

105
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,870
That's why I said we wouldn't die several times.

106
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,040
Why...

107
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,650
Why won't they die!?

108
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,110
G-God! I did everything you told me to!

109
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,220
G-God! I did everything you told me to!

110
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,130
G-God! I did everything you told me to!

111
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,470
Lester, Gevanni, seize Mikami!

112
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,730
Gevanni, the notebook.

113
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,240
Please confirm this with your own eyes.

114
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,730
The first four are, without a doubt, the SPK members' real names.

115
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,740
And the only one here whose name isn't written down, is... Yagami Light.

116
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,240
And the only one here whose name isn't written down, is... Yagami Light.

117
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,640
Mikami also called you "God", and said he did as you instructed.

118
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,550
It's settled.

119
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,880
Trap!! This is a trap!

120
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,050
Trap!! This is a trap!

121
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,060
It's a trap set by Near in order to frame me!

122
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,770
Writing the names in the notebook and not dying, isn't that strange?!

123
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,730
That proves it's a trap!

124
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,910
Didn't I tell you that I modified the notebook so that we wouldn't die?

125
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,140
N-Not true!

126
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,240
N-Not true!

127
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,420
You're wrong!

128
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,550
Unbelievable...

129
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,130
It's a trap... I don't even know that person!

130
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,650
It's a trap... I don't even know that person!

131
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,800
Light-kun, it's too late... Near won.

132
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,190
Light-kun, it's too late... Near won.

133
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,010
Light-kun, it's too late... Near won.

134
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,430
And you just said, "It's my victory".

135
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,220
That's the same as a confession.

136
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,570
Light-kun...

137
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,170
Why?

138
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,810
S-Stop!!

139
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,570
S-Stop!!

140
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,120
Yagami Light, "L", Kira.

141
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,820
Yagami Light, "L", Kira.

142
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,470
Yagami Light, "L", Kira.

143
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,840
You have lost.

144
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,340
Just now, you proclaimed your victory...

145
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,270
Although originally you would have won, and I would have lost.

146
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,110
Although originally you would have won, and I would have lost.

147
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,050
All this time we did exactly as you predicted, and altered the fake notebook.

148
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,340
All this time we did exactly as you predicted, and altered the fake notebook.

149
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,170
Except, earlier, when I said that I modified the notebook, that applied to the real notebook as well.

150
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,620
Except, earlier, when I said that I modified the notebook, that applied to the real notebook as well.

151
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,110
The fake one was only slightly modified...

152
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,300
The real one was replaced entirely.

153
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,970
This is the real notebook.

154
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,180
Im-Impossible!!

155
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,700
Im-Impossible!!

156
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,300
With the same pen that Mikami used, in the same handwriting...

157
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,800
With the same pen that Mikami used, in the same handwriting...

158
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,390
Everything looks identical.

159
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,980
Gevanni made this for us in one night.

160
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,760
Because I touched this notebook, I have been able to see the Shinigami.

161
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,300
Shinigami-san, a pleasure to meet you.

162
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,950
I'm Near.

163
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,330
Nice to meet you.

164
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,210
I'm Ryuk.

165
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,660
He's having a conversation with Ryuk...

166
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,090
Being able to see him must mean it's true.

167
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,760
In this notebook, it seems that a number of pages have been ripped out.

168
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,290
If someone's name is written on a torn page, would they die?

169
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,060
Yeah, they'd die.

170
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,050
As I thought.

171
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,730
So there are a number of ways to use it...

172
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,410
I wonder just how many people you killed, and how many times we've been fooled...

173
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,730
Yagami Light...

174
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,630
You are Kira!

175
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,700
There's something wrong here...

176
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,400
Could it be that Mikami betrayed me?

177
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,040
You're wrong...

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
It was all thanks to Mello.

179
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,600
Saying this much, you should understand by now.

180
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,590
Mello?!

181
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,220
Please take a good look at this...

182
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,890
Takada's name is in the notebook!

183
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,880
I was the one who killed Takada, and that one is set for one minute later!

184
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,020
I was the one who killed Takada, and that one is set for one minute later!

185
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,980
At that time, did Mikami also...

186
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,880
God, you said you were being watched and couldn't act!

187
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,280
With Takada in that situation... it was my duty to...

188
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,000
You IDIOT!! I told you NOT to do anything unnecessary until today!

189
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,780
That's right.

190
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,550
On the 26th, after the report featuring Takada's kidnapping, Mikami headed for the bank.

191
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,050
On the 26th, after the report featuring Takada's kidnapping, Mikami headed for the bank.

192
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,880
According to my investigation, Mikami only goes to the bank on the 25th of every month.

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,220
According to my investigation, Mikami only goes to the bank on the 25th of every month.

194
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,220
For someone as punctual as Mikami, going to the bank twice in two days is pretty unusual.

195
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,350
I followed him as he headed for the deposit boxes...

196
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,930
And only at that moment did he appear to be afraid of being tailed.

197
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,090
I was able to get into the deposit box, and inside, was the real notebook, with Takada's name written in it.

198
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,610
I was able to get into the deposit box, and inside, was the real notebook, with Takada's name written in it.

199
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,510
I was able to get into the deposit box, and inside, was the real notebook, with Takada's name written in it.

200
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,800
I was able to get into the deposit box, and inside, was the real notebook, with Takada's name written in it.

201
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,110
Yagami Light...

202
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:07,540
Even though you could kill someone with a piece of the note, you weren't aware that Mikami had done something on his own.

203
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,960
It was then that I realized the possibility of a fake notebook.

204
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,890
The biggest help in creating this scenario... was Mello.

205
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,600
The biggest help in creating this scenario... was Mello.

206
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Mello might have known this would happen...

207
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,430
By directly writing down your names in the notebook?

208
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,940
Yeah.

209
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,310
I'm the only one who can do it.

210
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,090
Mello knew this...

211
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:43,060
Alone, neither Mello nor I could surpass L...

212
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,220
But together... together, we are as able as L.

213
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,660
But together... together, we are as able as L.

214
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,670
Together, we can surpass L!

215
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,490
And now as one... against Kira who L himself couldn't take down, it's us who has the evidence!

216
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,390
And now as one... against Kira who L himself couldn't take down, it's us who has the evidence!

217
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,230
If you can talk your way out of this, by all means, please do...

218
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,180
That's right.

219
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,210
I am Kira.

220
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,740
That's right.

221
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,100
I am Kira.

222
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,510
So then, what will you do?

223
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,700
Kill me here?

224
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,750
Listen, I am Kira.

225
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,440
And also... God of the new world.

226
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,340
And also... God of the new world.

227
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,140
In the world we live in today, Kira is the law and protecting order.

228
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,560
Soon I will be justice.

229
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,270
The hope of all mankind...

230
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,440
Are you going to kill me?

231
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,900
Is that really okay?

232
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,450
In the six years Kira has existed, wars have ceased, violent criminals have almost died out...

233
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,040
In the six years Kira has existed, wars have ceased, violent criminals have almost died out...

234
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,290
In the six years Kira has existed, wars have ceased, violent criminals have almost died out...

235
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,950
But this world still rots!

236
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,250
There are too many rotten people...

237
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,260
Somebody has to do something!

238
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,230
At the time I obtained the notebook, I realized I had to do it!

239
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,800
At the time I obtained the notebook, I realized I had to do it!

240
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,190
No... Only I could do it!

241
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,030
No... Only I could do it!

242
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,940
I knew that killing people was a crime...

243
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,240
But there was no other way to correct things!

244
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,500
That was the purpose given to me!

245
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,160
Only I could do it...

246
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,880
Who else could have done it?!

247
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,330
To come this far?!

248
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,130
To be able to go on?!

249
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,600
That's right...

250
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,830
To create a new world... Only I can do it.

251
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,110
To create a new world... Only I can do it.

252
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,310
No... you are just a murderer.

253
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,180
No... you are just a murderer.

254
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,210
And this notebook is the deadliest weapon in the history of mankind.

255
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,930
You lost yourself to the Shinigami and to the power of the notebook.

256
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,410
And you're mistaken, thinking of becoming a God. You're only a crazy mass murderer.

257
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,950
And you're mistaken, thinking of becoming a God. You're only a crazy mass murderer.

258
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,080
That's all there is.

259
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,330
Nothing more.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,610
Like those fools would understand...

261
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,150
Near, the note you're holding...

262
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,910
And the one that Aizawa brought from the Japanese Investigation HQ...

263
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,540
Are they real?

264
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,550
Is he attempting to bluff?

265
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,370
I'm the only one who knows if it's the real thing.

266
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,010
If you want to defeat Kira, and prove that Aizawa's note is real...

267
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,270
If you want to defeat Kira, and prove that Aizawa's note is real...

268
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,150
You'll just have to write down mine or Mikami's name to find out.

269
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,760
If the note is real... or a fake?!

270
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,160
If the note is real... or a fake?!

271
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,830
It's a hidden note!!

272
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,100
Matsuda!

273
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,550
You asshole!!

274
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,890
Matsuda! Who do you think you're shooting at?!

275
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,730
Matsuda! Who do you think you're shooting at?!

276
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,990
Don't fuck with me!!

277
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,170
What was it...

278
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,580
Your father... what did he die for?!

279
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,100
Your father... what did he die for?!

280
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,130
Father?

281
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,110
You mean Yagami Souichiro?

282
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,990
That's right, Matsuda!

283
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,430
Serious people like that, crowned with justice, always lose in the end...

284
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,710
Are you okay living in such a society?!

285
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,370
I know you'll understand, so kill them!

286
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,750
SHOOT THEM!!

287
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,880
You drove your own father to his death...

288
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
And now you're saying they are the fools?!

289
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,370
His blood!

290
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,710
Kill... I have to kill him!!

291
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,980
Kill... I have to kill him!!

292
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,830
Matsuda!

293
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,750
Damn it...

294
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,520
What the hell is t-this?

295
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,820
What the hell is t-this?

296
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,530
Mikami... what the hell are you doing?!

297
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,510
Mikami... what the hell are you doing?!

298
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,860
Help!

299
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,570
Write!

300
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,350
Kill them!!

301
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,480
Near, it's over.

302
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,430
Near, it's over.

303
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,390
Yes.

304
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,390
Misa, where are you??

305
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,250
Where's Takada?!

306
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,160
S-Someone...

307
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,420
S-Someone...

308
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,980
It hurts... What do I do?

309
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,880
It hurts... What do I do?

310
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,910
Mi-Mikami is...

311
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,650
Mi-Mikami is...

312
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,350
Hang on!

313
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,860
No, but...

314
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,830
At this rate...

315
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,880
Light-kun!

316
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,190
Light-kun! Hold it!

317
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,910
Light-kun! Hold it!

318
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,350
Mr. Aizawa!

319
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,730
He shouldn't have any more hidden notes.

320
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,570
And he can't get far with those wounds...

321
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,860
If we leave him alone, his movements will stop.

322
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,030
Near, I can't follow your orders.

323
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,320
Near, I can't follow your orders.

324
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,590
I understand... I'll leave him to you.

325
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,080
I understand... I'll leave him to you.

326
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,100
You have lost, Light.

327
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,240
In the beginning, didn't I say... at the time of your death, I will be the one who'll write down your name in my notebook?

328
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,160
In the beginning, didn't I say... at the time of your death, I will be the one who'll write down your name in my notebook?

329
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,030
In the beginning, didn't I say... at the time of your death, I will be the one who'll write down your name in my notebook?

330
00:18:51,290 --> 00:19:01,720
That is the deal made between the Shinigami and the first human to possess the notebook.

331
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,410
Once you enter a prison, there's no telling when you'll die.

332
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,210
It's annoying to wait... your life is already over... You die here.

333
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,740
It's annoying to wait... your life is already over... You die here.

334
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,440
It's annoying to wait... your life is already over... You die here.

335
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,100
It was good while it lasted...

336
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,190
We killed some boredom, didn't we?

337
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,950
We did various interesting things...

338
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,030
