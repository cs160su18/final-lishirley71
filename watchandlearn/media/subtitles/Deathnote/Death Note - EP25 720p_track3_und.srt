00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,500
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

91
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,590
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,740
What's the matter, Ryuuzaki?

93
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,160
What is it?

94
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,860
Silence

95
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,930
The corner of a page in this murderer's notebook appears to have been torn off.

96
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,000
Would a person still die if their name was written on the torn-off part?

97
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,260
Who knows? I've never used it that way, so I wouldn't know.

98
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,360
So, is it true that Shinigami only eat apples?

99
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,100
That's not true.

100
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,240
But a Shinigami's internal organs are retrogressive.

101
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,850
No, in fact, they've evolved such that we no longer need to eat.

102
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,020
Yagami-kun.

103
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,500
You've finally been freed, and yet you never leave this place.

104
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,190
Even when Misa-san comes to see you, you only chat for a few minutes.

105
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,000
When I said that you're free to take your romance outside now, I meant it.

106
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,730
The Kira case is far from over.

107
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,780
Right now, I'm hardly in the mood for romance.

108
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,280
Or are you saying that you've got a problem with me always being here?

109
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,320
No...

110
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,740
Right now, I'm not in a position where I can judge criminals.

111
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,910
Misa, I want you to judge them.

112
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,260
Misa, I want you to judge them.

113
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,050
Misa... let's build a new world, together.

114
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,060
Misa... let's build a new world, together.

115
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,570

116
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,570

118
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,070
God is watching you.

119
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,890
In the dark streets of the night

120
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,890

121
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,910

128

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,850
watashi ga oboete nakute mo

130
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,850
and even if I forget,

131
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:53,110
he tells me time and time again.

132
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:53,110
nando demo oshiete kureru

133
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:08,030
demo zenbu wakatte shimattara dou sureba ii no...

134
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:08,030
But what will I do once I've learned everything?

135
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
What's the meaning of this?!

136
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,430
There are more criminals being killed?!

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
Yesterday alone, there was 16...

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,690
All of them were broadcast as criminals after Higuchi's death.

139
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,320
It's just one after the other...

140
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,400
I guess this means that Higuchi wasn't Kira after all...

141
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,270
No. We know for a fact that until Higuchi was captured, he was the one judging criminals.

142
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,610
So, you're saying that yet another Kira has made an appearance?

143
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,460
Why?!

144
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,380
Damn you, Kira!

145
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,170
Kira... now?

146
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,260
What's going on?

147
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,300
I don't believe this...

148
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,900
Misa is the only possibility!

149
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,300
This began the instant Amane was freed.

150
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,770
Ryuuzaki, I can't believe you're still saying that.

151
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,570
Misa has nothing to do with this.

152
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,880
If we're talking about "the instant" this started, that was when Higuchi died.

153
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,670
That's true.

154
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,990
Well, in any case, if there is someone out there using a second notebook...

155
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,430
We'll definitely catch that person.

156
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,050
The Shinigami said she didn't know, but if it's possible to kill someone using paper torn out from the notebook... it's not impossible.

157
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:32,670
The Shinigami said she didn't know, but if it's possible to kill someone using paper torn out from the notebook... it's not impossible.

158
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,080
The Shinigami said she didn't know, but if it's possible to kill someone using paper torn out from the notebook... it's not impossible.

159
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:42,100
But once someone writes a name in this notebook, they need to write another name within 13 days or they'll die.

160
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,290
Yagami Light and Amane Misa are still alive...

161
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,590
13 days... this is the only...

162
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,690
13 days... this is the only...

163
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,430
But Ryuuzaki, even if we manage to catch the person who's writing names in the notebook,

164
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,460
will you actually be able to charge them of mass murder and get a conviction?

165
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,830
Of course! They wrote a lot of people's names in the notebook knowing that those people would die as a result!

166
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,880
If we can't make the notebook public knowledge like that, we should obliterate them!

167
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,260
Obliteration isn't the calmest solution to the problem.

168
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,990
I guess the higher-ups will opt for a solution similar to that though.

169
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,430
If we can prove the murders resulted from the notebook, it'll be the death penalty, or at the very least, life imprisonment.

170
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,190
That's more or less how it goes.

171
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,520
What are you thinking, Yagami Light?!

172
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,450
If Misa gets caught, then you'll--

173
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,610
So, that's it! This guy is unbelievable!

174
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,160
So, that's it! This guy is unbelievable!

175
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,220
Yagami Light is certain that I'll save Misa's life.

176
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:55,470
In this situation, the only way to save Misa is to write Ryuuzaki's real name in my own notebook.

177
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,280
And if I kill Ryuuzaki... I'll undeniably have interfered with Misa's lifespan, and will also die.

178
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,640
And if I kill Ryuuzaki... I'll undeniably have interfered with Misa's lifespan, and will also die.

179
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,980
And if I kill Ryuuzaki... I'll undeniably have interfered with Misa's lifespan, and will also die.

180
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,410
This is all set up for the benefit of Yagami Light!

181
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,480
So, what will you do, Rem?

182
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,540
Despite the fact that you're a Shinigami, I know you're into Misa.

183
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,300
There's no way you'll stand by and let Misa die after her lifespan has just been halved again.

184
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,210
Think of Misa's happiness.

185
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,070
What are you doing out here, Ryuuzaki?

186
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,180
What are you doing out here, Ryuuzaki?

187
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,870
What are you doing, Ryuuzaki?

188
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,980
Ah, it's nothing worth mentioning.

189
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,630
The sound of bells...

190
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,420
Bells?

191
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,730
Yes, the bells sound incredibly noisy today.

192
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,430
I don't hear anything.

193
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,320
Oh, really?

194
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,820
They've been ringing incessantly today; I can't stop thinking about it.

195
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,840
They've been ringing incessantly today; I can't stop thinking about it.

196
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,580
Maybe there's a wedding at a church, or maybe...

197
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,250
What are you talking about, Ryuuzaki?

198
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,260
Stop talking nonsense. Let's go inside.

199
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,220
Sorry. Everything I say is made up on the spot, so please don't believe a word of it.

200
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,170
Sorry. Everything I say is made up on the spot, so please don't believe a word of it.

201
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,980
Sorry. Everything I say is made up on the spot, so please don't believe a word of it.

202
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,440
You're right, Ryuuzaki. The majority of what you say isn't true.

203
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,940
You're right, Ryuuzaki. The majority of what you say isn't true.

204
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,610
If I took it all seriously, there'd be no end to it.

205
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,010
I know that better than anyone else.

206
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,070
That's true, Light-kun.

207
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,050
But... the same applies to you.

208
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,970
But... the same applies to you.

209
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,940
What do you mean?

210
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,590
Have you ever uttered a single completely true thing since you were born?

211
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,000
What are you talking about, Ryuuzaki?

212
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Certainly I lie every now and then, but surely no one can be truthful throughout their entire life?

213
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,850
People aren't that perfect.

214
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,070
Everyone lies.

215
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,050
But even so, I've made a point of not telling lies that will hurt others.

216
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,260
That's my answer.

217
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,010
I thought you'd say that.

218
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,240
Let's go back inside. We're both soaked.

219
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,140
Yeah.

220
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,320
Wow. That was quite an ordeal, wasn't it?

221
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,760
It's all your fault for being out in that downpour.

222
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,070
True. I'm sorry.

223
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,020
True. I'm sorry.

224
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,190
What are you doing, Ryuuzaki?!

225
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,460
I thought I'd help. You seem to be drying yourself with quite some fervor.

226
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,880
It's fine. You don't have to do something like that.

227
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,510
I'll throw in a massage?

228
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,440
At least allow me to atone for this. I'm not at all bad at it, you know.

229
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,220
Do as you please.

230
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,190
Okay.

231
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,020
Hey.

232
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,560
You'll get used to it quickly.

233
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,200
You're still wet.

234
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,670
Sorry...

235
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,050
Sad, isn't it?

236
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,250
Huh?

237
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,910
It's nearly time to say farewell.

238
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,760
Yes? Understood, I'll be there straight away.

239
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,860
Yes? Understood, I'll be there straight away.

240
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,780
Yes? Understood, I'll be there straight away.

241
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,990
Shall we go then, Light-kun?

242
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,870
Seems like things have gone well.

243
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,150
Ryuuzaki, what's the meaning of this?!

244
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,590
You've got permission from a ruined country to use the notebook in an execution?!

245
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,160
Watari, good job.

246
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,050
No problem.

247
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,520
Please begin the arrangements to transport the notebook at once.

248
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,700
Yes.

249
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,330
Ryuuzaki! What's going on?!

250
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,080
We're going to test the notebook for real.

251
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,330
This is absurd! There's no need to do this now.

252
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,690
We already know that the power of the notebook is real.

253
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,890
Besides, who is going to write the name?

254
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:02,420
Once you do, you have to write in it every 13 days for the rest of your life!

255
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,240
The person who will write the name in the notebook... will be someone who's already been sentenced to die within 13 days.

256
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,040
The person who will write the name in the notebook... will be someone who's already been sentenced to die within 13 days.

257
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,200
We'll do a probationary deal, saying that if they're alive after 13 days, they'll be removed from death row.

258
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,810
But... people's lives--

259
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,430
It's just a little further!

260
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,780
If we manage to clarify this, it'll take us straight to the solution.

261
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,130
Huh?! W-What's happening?! A power cut?

262
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,620
Huh?! W-What's happening?! A power cut?

263
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,340
Huh?! W-What's happening?! A power cut?

264
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,100
Huh?! W-What's happening?! A power cut?

265
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,080
Watari?

266
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,150
Watari?!

267
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,760
Deletion of data? What's happening?

268
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:59,040
I instructed Watari to delete all the data if something were to happen to him.

269
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,680
"If something were to happen to him"?

270
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,680
Don't tell me...

271
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,430
Where's the Shinigami?

272
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,170
Now that you mention it... I can't see her.

273
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,750
She's not here!

274
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,960
What does this mean?

275
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,010
Everyone, the Shiniga--

276
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,190
Ryuuzaki!! What's wrong?!

277
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,270
Ryuuzaki!! What's wrong?!

278
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,180
Oi, Ryuuzaki? What's the matter? Get a hold of yourself!

279
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,670
Oi, Ryuuzaki? What's the matter? Get a hold of yourself!

280
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,750
Oi, Ryuuzaki? What's the matter? Get a hold of yourself!

281
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,710
Oi, Ryuuzaki? What's the matter? Get a hold of yourself!

282
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,670
What?!

283
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,850
What happened?!

284
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,410
Calm down, Light!

285
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,410
We're going to be killed!

286
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,020
Watari, Ryuuzaki... and now us!

287
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,030
Watari, Ryuuzaki... and now us!

288
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,540
Watari, Ryuuzaki... and now us!

289
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,600
Fuck! Where's that Shinigami?! Show yourself!!

290
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,180
Fuck! Where's that Shinigami?! Show yourself!!

291
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,220
Fuck! Where's that Shinigami?! Show yourself!!

292
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,150
L-Light...

293
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,880
L-Light...

294
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,340
You must know something about this! Show yourself!

295
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,310
You must know something about this! Show yourself!

296
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,700
We should look as well.

297
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,190
Mogi, we'll leave the rest to you.

298
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,140
Understood.

299
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,160
Everyone! Get over here!

300
00:19:59,440 --> 00:19:59,880
W-What the hell is this?!

301
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,180
W-What the hell is this?!

302
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,200
Sand?

303
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,310
What's going on?

304
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,290
Whatever it is, whatever's going on here... I will avenge Ryuuzaki's death.

305
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,010
Whatever it is, whatever's going on here... I will avenge Ryuuzaki's death.

306
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,300
Whatever it is, whatever's going on here... I will avenge Ryuuzaki's death.

307
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,780
Solving this case is the only way to bid him farewell.

308
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,980
For Watari, and the other victims too... for everyone.

309
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,310
For Watari, and the other victims too... for everyone.

310
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,670
Light...

311
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,240
That's right, Light-kun.

312
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,560
B-But we'll be killed! Isn't that what this has been about?

313
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,850
B-But we'll be killed! Isn't that what this has been about?

314
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,690
Matsuda-san, if you're scared of being killed, then I suggest you leave.

315
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,420
This team is composed of men willing to give their lives.

316
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:44,990
Erm, well, I guess you're right... but don't say it how Ryuuzaki would, Light-kun.

317
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,580
All my obstacles have been removed.

318
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,000
I am the god of a new world.

319
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,960

321
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,420
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

322
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,010
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

Incessant drool at false fantasies;

330
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,360
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.
