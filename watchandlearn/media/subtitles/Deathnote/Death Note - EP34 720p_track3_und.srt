WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,450
Misa is going to announce our engagement at the New Year Show.

93
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,360
Although Mira likes Kira too, he'll soon be caught by Light.

94
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,910
You'll also definitely be... put to death.

95
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,610
You'll also definitely be... put to death.

96
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,980
Please send me a fan letter than only you and I could recognize.

97
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,100
In it, include five pages from the notebook.

98
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,700
In it, include five pages from the notebook.

99
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,080
Until I receive it, please continue with your judgments.

100
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,290
And after I send it to you?

101
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:56,090
Make a fake copy of the notebook and continue your judgments using it.

102
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,080
What's wrong, lady?

103
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,140
You are inviting me to do that by wearing such short skirts...

104
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,140
Someone...

105
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,230
Eliminate.

106
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,970
Mikami is getting off the train.

107
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,990
Vigilance

108
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,830
The man who was harassing a girl in the same car as Mikami just collapsed.

109
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,230
It happened a few seconds after Mikami wrote something in the note.

110
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,250
This probably means...

111
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,500
This settles it.

112
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,860
Yes.

113
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,050
In any case, we must first get close to Mikami.

114
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,950
But in order to do that, we must be wary of something.

115
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,090
That is... the existence of the Shinigami.

116
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,640
That is... the existence of the Shinigami.

117
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,480
If the Shinigami finds out that we are trailing Mikami, we have to assume that it will warn him.

118
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,240
But only those who've touched the notebook can see the Shinigami.

119
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,610
It's difficult to avoid something that can't be seen.

120
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,450
Even if it's difficult, please do it.

121
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,240
Understood.

122
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,300
Today, Light-kun will meet with Takada in this room again.

123
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,300
Right after the secret meeting began, Takada received a phone call from Kira, and the hidden cameras had to be removed.

124
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,730
Right after the secret meeting began, Takada received a phone call from Kira, and the hidden cameras had to be removed.

125
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,770
Right after the secret meeting began, Takada received a phone call from Kira, and the hidden cameras had to be removed.

126
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,040
My first thought was that this would allow communication through written messages.

127
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,300
It's alright.

128
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,360
Other than the bug attached to me, there's nothing else in this room.

129
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,450
Ah, all that's left is the bathroom then.

130
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,140
Why is Light-kun so insistent on the cameras and bugs?

131
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,030
No... to begin with, why is Kira allowing this meeting?

132
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,880
No... to begin with, why is Kira allowing this meeting?

133
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,550
Something doesn't make sense here.

134
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,050
If by any chance they are communicating through written messages... what can be done is...

135
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,880
If by any chance they are communicating through written messages... what can be done is...

136
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,660
Yagami-kun. I spoke privately with Amane-san yesterday.

137
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,030
About what?

138
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,130
This puts Light-kun in a pinch!

139
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,950
What are you so happy about, Matsuda?

140
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Amane-san said she would announce your engagement at the New Year Show.

141
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,560
Pinch! Pinch! Big pinch!

142
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,380
Pinch! Pinch! Big pinch!

143
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,550
Pinch! Pinch! Big pinch!

144
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,710
Matsuda, shut up!

145
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,810
Ah no... It's just that I haven't been able to...

146
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,410
Ah no... It's just that I haven't been able to...

147
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,010
But to me there isn't anything special.

148
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,780
That Misa... doing such useless things... no, Takada is to blame as well.

149
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,730
That Misa... doing such useless things... no, Takada is to blame as well.

150
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,990
Women are such unreasonable creatures.

151
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,110
Nothing special...? I wonder if that's true.

152
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,310
Nothing special...? I wonder if that's true.

153
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,570
She was the one carrying out Kira's judgments before T.

154
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,590
She had obtained Kira's power from somewhere that I wasn't aware of, and because she knew I was Kira, it couldn't be avoided.

155
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,780
She had obtained Kira's power from somewhere that I wasn't aware of, and because she knew I was Kira, it couldn't be avoided.

156
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,410
Had that not been the case, I wouldn't have chosen such an airheaded person like her.

157
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,870
Amane-san was carrying out Kira's judgment... but now I am... there was no choice with Amane-san, while I was chosen by Yagami-kun.

158
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,670
Amane-san was carrying out Kira's judgment... but now I am... there was no choice with Amane-san, while I was chosen by Yagami-kun.

159
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,170
Amane-san was carrying out Kira's judgment... but now I am... there was no choice with Amane-san, while I was chosen by Yagami-kun.

160
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,610
Amane-san was carrying out Kira's judgment... but now I am... there was no choice with Amane-san, while I was chosen by Yagami-kun.

161
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,160
Takada-san, please believe me. Right now, there's only you.

162
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,470
Takada-san, please believe me. Right now, there's only you.

163
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,350
"There's only you"? That doesn't sound like Yagami-kun at all. Such a common line.

164
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,820
Indeed, it doesn't sound like Light-kun. It's just a poor excuse.

165
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,820
That's because I didn't try hard enough to be your benefactor.

166
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,830
Then... between Amane and Takada, who is he really interested in?

167
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,070
I wonder how many women have heard you say that?

168
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,130
That would be... both of them.

169
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,630
That would be... both of them.

170
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,020
Takada-san, do you really think I'm that kind of person?

171
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,480
Both of them!? How can anyone allow that kind of thing?

172
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,660
I'm sorry.

173
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,430
Hey! It's not me that's...

174
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,700
Shut up!

175
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,130
From now on I'll believe what you say, but if you're lying, the consequences will be heavy...

176
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,410
Because I'll tell Kira.

177
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,970
Kira?

178
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,310
I understand that Kira has become a necessity in this world,

179
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,940
but recently I've been thinking about whether the day that you and I can be together will ever come.

180
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,980
One way or another, I hate Kira for choosing Takada-san as his representative.

181
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,280
Although it's alright to kill evil people, we aren't bad people.

182
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,290
We should have the right to be happy.

183
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,680
In order for us to become happy, Kira must disappear.

184
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,250
In order for us to become happy, Kira must disappear.

185
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,030
Yes... if only Kira didn't exist.

186
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,010
Yes... if only Kira didn't exist.

187
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,840
It could be done if Kira were to be caught.

188
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,730
That's right.

189
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,400
For us to be happy... Kira must be caught.

190
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,090
For us to be happy... Kira must be caught.

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,800
Takada-san, are you serious?

192
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,530
Yes.

193
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,620
In order to do that, we'll need your cooperation. It'll also be dangerous.

194
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,870
In order to do that, we'll need your cooperation. It'll also be dangerous.

195
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,330
It means that I'll be going against police policy, and you'll be going against Kira and the world.

196
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,080
Is it okay if it comes to that?

197
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,890
That was amazingly well put.

198
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,180
Fine.

199
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,480
If cooperating with you means that we can both be happy...

200
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,690
That's just like Light-kun... a complete turn-around!

201
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,570
To think that he was able to change his two-timing relationship with Misa-Misa into cooperation with Taki!

202
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,080
Mikami just muttered to himself!

203
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,950
Muttered to himself?

204
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,080
Yes. Because of the distance, I wasn't able to make out what he said, but I managed to get an image of his lips.

205
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,130
This is an image from the roof of the prosecutor's office where Mikami works, during his break.

206
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,620
This is the place. He seems to have said something.

207
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,910
Play it again in slow motion.

208
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,160
"Shi-ni-ga-mi?", isn't it?

209
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,610
"Shi-ni-ga-mi?", isn't it?

210
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,160
"Shi-ni-ga-mi?", isn't it?

211
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,620
"Shi-ni-ga-mi?", isn't it?

212
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,670
"Shi-ni-ga-mi?", isn't it?

213
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,360
"Shi-ni-ga-mi?", isn't it?

214
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,330
He seems to have reacted to some scrap paper under his foot.

215
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,700
He just sighed...

216
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,770
From here, it looks like he's saying a bit more.

217
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,020
I'll zoom in on his lips.

218
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,060

240
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,890
That Shinigami hasn't appeared since he gave me the notebook.

241
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:13,070
Mikami was given a notebook by a Shinigami, however, the Shinigami hasn't been with him since then.

242
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,610
I see.

243
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,210
Well then, Yagami-kun, will that be all for today?

244
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,390
Yeah.

245
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,270
It's finally over! Today was pretty busy.

246
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,750
It's pretty tough to do this for hours.

247
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,720
Couldn't tell by the smile on your face.

248
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,740
I'll be back after I check out of the hotel.

249
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,700
Thanks for your hard work!

250
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,900
Aizawa-san has it pretty tough, having to check in and out of the hotel.

251
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,240
It's gone! The nail mark that was supposed to be...

252
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,290
It's gone! The nail mark that was supposed to be...

253
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,810
Two of the four notes have no nail marks.

254
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,890
The room is still as it was... room service hasn't been in here yet.

255
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,150
The room is still as it was... room service hasn't been in here yet.

256
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,800
Why have the memos been changed to new ones?

257
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,190
They're communicating in writing!

258
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,250
Yes?

259
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,160
What? You want to see Near? And speak to him in person?

260
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,300
What? You want to see Near? And speak to him in person?

261
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,000
What? You want to see Near? And speak to him in person?

262
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,360
Mr. Aizawa, it's been a while.

263
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,270
And, I'm pleased to meet you.

264
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,780
Being blindfolded, I can't really say things like "pleased to meet you".

265
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,620
He didn't bring any weapons or cameras with him.

266
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,240
Then it won't matter if you take off your blindfold.

267
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,670
Near, I believe in you now.

268
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,320
Near, I believe in you now.

269
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,050
L is meeting Takada every night.

270
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,250
I know that.

271
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,020
What about this then?

272
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,640
They have been communicating with notes.

273
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,720
There's no doubt.

274
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,850
Mr. Aizawa, please do not do needless things on your own.

275
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,850
Mr. Aizawa, please do not do needless things on your own.

276
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,640
Needless things?

277
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,460
Yes.

278
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,850
We're at the point now where we don't need further proof of Kira's identity.

279
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,600
To stop Kira, it is up to me to expose him, and let him suffer a total defeat.

280
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,360
Mr. Aizawa, I'll be honest with you.

281
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,410
You people are already out of the picture.

282
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,710
But, if you still want to capture Kira despite knowing that...

283
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,990
Then please, continue to watch him as you are now.

284
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,090
Then please, continue to watch him as you are now.

285
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,200
Just... keep watch?

286
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,650
Just... keep watch?

287
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,650
Yes. However, there is reason to keep watching L, and that has been written into my scenario.

288
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,380
Yes. However, there is reason to keep watching L, and that has been written into my scenario.

289
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,360
Yes. However, there is reason to keep watching L, and that has been written into my scenario.

290
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,680
I hope you can help me this way, in order to defeat Kira.

291
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,290
I hope you can help me this way, in order to defeat Kira.

292
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,920
And after that, please witness... the end of Kira.

293
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,670
And after that, please witness... the end of Kira.

294
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:02,590
This past year has been a dramatic one for me.

295
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:09,150
I'm the host for this year's New Year Show, Takada Kiyomi.

296
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,810
Please show your support.

297
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,980
Well, the New Year Show is finally going to begin.

298
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,580
Matsuda, come look at the situation with judgments and check the list of deaths.

299
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,110
That can wait until the performance of our Misa-Misa, the main act.

300
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,120
W-What the...?

301
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,940
W-What the...?

302
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,330
We are the SPK.

303
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,650
We'd like you to come with us.

304
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,970
Now, there is something I must apologize to everyone for...

305
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,640
Our main act for this year, Amane Misa-san, has yet to arrive at the studio.

306
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,310
But...

307
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,770
What is going on?

308
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,940
There's been no word from Mogi either.

309
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,690
Hurry up and let me go back to NHN!

310
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,710
If you don't do that, Misa will be seen as someone who backs out at the last minute!

311
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,360
Misa-Misa, please stay calm and quiet.

312
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,950
What is with you, Mochii?

313
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,070
This is to capture Kira.

314
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,670
What has that got to do with Misa?

315
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,170
We considered using guns to get you to come with us as a last resort.

316
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,120
But you didn't resist at all... that really helped us, Mr. Mogi.

317
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,660
But you didn't resist at all... that really helped us, Mr. Mogi.

318
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,030
I would've resisted if Aizawa hadn't told me what happened.

319
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,940
Still...

320
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,970
After hearing about the memo pads... it really is...

321
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,140
After hearing about the memo pads... it really is...

322
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,390
What's going on?

323
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,710
Near.

324
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,690
What is it, L?

325
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,730
We lost track of Mogi and Amane Misa.

326
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,700
Yes, we've invited them over here.

327
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,180
What did he say?

328
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,490
Why is that?

329
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,870
This is just in case.

330
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,280
Near, abduction is a crime.

331
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,780
Please stop at once.

332
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,510
But Mr. Mogi and Amane accepted happily.

333
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,010
I will connect you to them now...

334
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,830
Mogi-san, Misa-san... this is L.

335
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,040
Mogi-san, Misa-san... this is L.

336
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,980
Mogi-san, Misa-san... this is L.

337
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,480
Light!

338
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,030
I heard that you both put yourselves in Near's custody willingly. Is this true?

339
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,030
Yes.

340
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,830
Mogi...

341
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,980
Misa was opposed to it! But Mochii said that it'd be better to keep quiet...

342
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,750
Otherwise, everyone will be killed.

343
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,340
I understand. Since both of you agreed, it's alright.

344
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,720
Amane Misa, highly suspected of being the second Kira, is now a captive.

345
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,970
Yagami Light, you should know the meaning of this move.

346
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,320
Quit messing around! You think you can get away with not bringing out Misa-Misa!?

347
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,420
That's right! Bring her out!

348
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,690
Lidner and the others seem to have carried it out smoothly.

349
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,440
It's past 9pm.

350
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,950
Okay, I'll make my move.

351
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:54,050
Mikami has a fixed routine and goes home at almost the exact same time every day.

352
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,830
And every Monday and Thursday, he will definitely be at this gym at about 2100 hours.

353
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,250
Yes. In the four years he's been a member, he's always maintained this routine.

354
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,950
He doesn't rest, even on New Year's Day.

355
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,250
I signed up too, and found that out.

356
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,590
Then he should be going this Monday the 31st too, right?

357
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,220
Yes... for a person who'd go even on New Year's Day, New Year's Eve will not be an exception.

358
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,930
Gevanni...

359
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,560
Is it possible for you to touch the notebook on the 31st in the gym?

360
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,020
Yes.

361
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,470
I can deal with the security in the hotel, and there are no surveillance cameras in the locker room either.

362
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,710
Then I'll be counting on you.

363
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,380
If there is indeed a Shinigami, there's a possibility that I will die, isn't there?

364
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,590
Yes. I am getting you to do this in order to confirm it.

365
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:59,090
And if you do not see a Shinigami after touching it, I will need to observe what happens to determine whether it is following him.

366
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,540
If you're too afraid, I'll get Lester to do it.

367
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,850
I understand. I'll do it.

368
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,730
If there is indeed a Shinigami around...

369
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,210
No, if that's the case, maybe I'm already...

370
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,400
At this point, I only have to touch it!

371
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,160
I've succeeded in touching the notebook!

372
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,170
At this time and place, I have not seen a Shinigami.

373
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,590
Commander Lester, please connect me to Mr. Mogi.

374
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,680
Mr. Mogi, according to the rules of the Death Note, how long can someone be manipulated before their death?

375
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,180
According to the data from the Yotsuba Incident, 23 days.

376
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,690
Are you sure?

377
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,150
Yes. The killings from the Yotsuba Incident were enough to prove it.

378
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,400
Thank you very much.

379
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:46,660
From now, there is a possibility that Gevanni is being controlled to say that a Shinigami is not around.

380
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,890
We'll arrange for a showdown with L after 24 days... and we'll carry it out if Gevanni is still alive then.

381
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,540
We'll arrange for a showdown with L after 24 days... and we'll carry it out if Gevanni is still alive then.

382
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:02,970
January 3rd

383
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,970
Takada-san, the New Year's Show must have been hard on you.

384
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,010
Yeah... to think Amane-san just disappeared like that.

385
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,230
Give T instructions to contact you once he has confirmed everything.

386
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:19,860
Once the message comes, give me a call or send me an email, saying "I want to see you as soon as possible".

387
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,700
January 6th

388
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,950
Photos?

389
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,540
Yes. I want to see exactly how it was written.

390
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,960
Whether there were any patterns as he wrote the names, and exactly what kind of notebook it is.

391
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,420
I would like to see all the details for myself.

392
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,710
How is it, Near?

393
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,150
Yes. Gevanni has done a fantastic job.

394
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,120
The handwriting matches that of Mikami's prosecution reports.

395
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,470
Without a doubt, this was written by Mikami.

396
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,330
Yeah.

397
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,790
If that's the case, it can be done.

398
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

399
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

400
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
This one page of everlasting depression;

401
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,350
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

402
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,350

404
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,620
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

405
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,200
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

406
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,200
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

407
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,850
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

408
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,850
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

410
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,700
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

411
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,140
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

412
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,140
Who would know of a path to salvation?

413
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,990
Menzai no waarudo

414

00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,820
words of retribution!

Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

Come, relentless eraser rain.

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,860
relentless eraser rain.

434
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,860

436
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,220
The Guard Team was attacked!

437
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,240
Takada-san, are you alright?

438
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,830
Is it Near again?

439
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,380
No... the way it was carried out, rather than Near, it could be...

440
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,090
Mello?

441
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,910
Next Time

442
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,910
Murder Intent
