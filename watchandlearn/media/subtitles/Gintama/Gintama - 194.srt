This school was in the same
district as Gintama High,

If you get in my way again, I'll kill ya.

Are the things protruding from your

Eh?

The sevens, the hardest
part of the times table...

38
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,910
Uh, six sevens would be 45...

39
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,100
No, that's not it...

40
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,090
In this case, it'd either be 38 or 48...

Yato Industrial High School eight times.

the battle starts.

163
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,120
Take care of your business now.

164
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,800
If you don't piss now, you'll have
to hold it in for at least an hour.

165
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,420
Hijikata-san, we didn't come
here on a picnic.

166
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,490
Shut up!

167
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:53,000
You're the type of kid who make them stop the bus to
piss in the bush, crying, while all the traffic goes by!

168
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,780
Hijikata-san, we're not on a bus.

169
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,980
Shut up!

170
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,860
I told you to piss, so piss, damn it!

171
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,340
Man, this is such a pain.

172
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,580
There goes all the tension.

173
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,730
I already squeezed out every
last drop before coming here.

174
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,840
Kondo-san, why don't you join them?

175
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,220
Nah, I already took a piss.

176
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,650
You should go wash your face.

177
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,240
It'll help you focus.

178
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,600
Really?

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,250
I'll be gone for a bit then.

180
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,790
Stay on your guard.

181
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,540
Yeah, don't worry.

182
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,500
Okay, it's all good now.

183
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Once he looks in the mirror,
he'll notice Tarzan yelling.

184
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I can only pray that Tarzan will return
to the forest before anyone notices.

185
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,290
Okay, I'm focused now.

186
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,010
Let's get going!

187
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,010
Yeah!

188
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,140
T-Tarzan's come out to New York!

189
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,080
Why?!

190
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,500
What's going on?!

191
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,370
He washed his face, yet his snot's
gone from Tarzan to Leviathan?!

192
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,370
[Note: Referring to the Leviathan from the
"Final Fantasy" video game series.]

193
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,410
Hey, check out the commander...

194
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,040
Isn't there something on
his nose? What is that?

195
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,820
Isn't it Leviathan?

196
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,570
This is bad... They're starting
to notice Leviathan...

197
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,910
Fall off!

198
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,430
Leviathan, that isn't where you belong!

199
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,440
Back you go to the Feymarch!

200
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,440
[Note: From Final Fantasy IV for the Nintendo DS.]

201
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,260
There it goes!

202
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,170
It's definitely gone now!

203
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,810
What? Did I catch a cold?

204
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,320
N-Now Bahamut's been summoned!

205
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,310
Crap!

206
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,610
I didn't expect Bahamut to be
renting the room next door!

207
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,850
Squad 1 has reached their floor!

208
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,200
Very well. Squad 1 will also move out.

209
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah!

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,520
I-It's impossible to hide now...

211
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,330
Bahamut and Leviathan...

212
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,520
They won't stop until
everything's destroyed...

213
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,220
What do I do?

214
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,340
So-Sogo!

215
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,480
What is it?

216
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,900
Take squad 1 and use the
emergency stairwell.

217
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,960
I'll join the double dragons, I mean...

218
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,460
Kondo-san in attacking from the front.

219
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,290
Will the two of you be
okay by yourselves?

220
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,230
The goal is to confuse the enemy.

221
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,570
You don't need to worry.

222
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,680
I'm willing to die to protect Kondo-san.

223
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,440
Toshi?

224
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,420
Let me handle this.

225
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,290
I managed to get rid of the men,

226
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,180
but the problem now is how to proceed.

227
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,190
If we charge in, the enemy will
see these double dragons.

228
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,880
Huh?

229
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,650
Hey, this guy's dripping snot!

230
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,700
You should take care of your nose
before taking care of patriots!

231
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,120
Stop!

232
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,450
Don't look!

233
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,250
I have to do something before
the situation gets ugly...

234
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,960
Eliminate the double dragons without messing
with Kondo-san's serious manner.

235
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,630
Toshi, check that out.

236
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,760
The enemy has people on patrol.

237
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,660
If we're spotted, the enemy will
be alerted to our presence,

238
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,180
and our ambush will fail.

239
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,360
Yeah, you're right...

240
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,170
There's no time to get hung
up about cleanliness.

241
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,160
I'll just use my hand.

242
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,650
There's no other way to bring
down those giants.

243
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,190
Bahamut and Leviathan...

244
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,820
Which to go for first...

245
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,170
Given the way he's turned,
Leviathan will be difficult...

246
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,920
Guess I'll start with Bahamut.

247
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,830
Okay!

248
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,760
Bahamut just?!

249
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,660
What?!

250
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,440
Did it sense the impeding danger?!

251
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,740
Leviathan's doubled in size instead!

252
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,240
What's going on?!

253
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,020
Come on! Don't tell me Bahamut and
Leviathan are connected in the back?

254
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,910
They're a couple?

255
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,090
That makes this easy then.

256
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,370
Grab one and they're both goners!

257
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,440
That's it!

258
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,280
[Note: Odin's trademark attack from FF series.]

259
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,280
I'll go for Zantetsuken!

260
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,940
My eyes! My eyes!

261
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,940
Hey, Toshi!

262
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,910
You okay?!

263
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,500
Sn-Snot came flying out!

264
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,670
Snot came flying at me like a Flare spell!

265
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,210
What's going on?!

266
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,120
Hey! What're you doing?!

267
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,470
Whoa! What's with that sno...

268
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,780
Whoa!

269
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,370
Nice one, Toshi!

270
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,640
That was instant!

271
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,520
Th-That was close...

272
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,770
He was about to find out.

273
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,740
Hey, wasn't that guy saying
something about sno...

274
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,340
He wasn't!

275
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,900
No, pretty sure I heard sno...

276
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,970
He must have been talking
about snowbells, yeah.

277
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,850
He realized he was about to die, so he wanted
to request snowbells at his grave.

278
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,760
Snowbells...

279
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,150
Damn, that's loud!

280
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,530
What's all the noise about...

281
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,750
What the hell is that s-...

282
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,130
Socrates!

283
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,740
I-It's the Shinsengumi!

284
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,790
Onward!

285
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,320
Wh-What's with this guy?!

286
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,460
He's got all that sn-...

287
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,760
Soul Society!

288
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,090
Hey! That's s-...

289
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,590
Son Goku!

290
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,220
Whoa! S-...

291
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,180
'Nothing to worry about!

292
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,290
The hell's up with this guy?!

293
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,440
He's a monster!

294
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
Run!

295
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,650
You won't get away!

296
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,110
Zaki!

297
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,320
Crap!

298
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,380
Huh?

299
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,110
Commander, what's with that s-...

300
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,480
Yamazaki!

301
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,740
You okay?!

302
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,300
Who did this to you?!

303
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,270
A vase suddenly...

304
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,630
Zaki...

305
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,800
Damn them!

306
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,170
They won't get away with this!

307
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,260
Wait!

308
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,360
Hold on!

309
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,510
Here.

310
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,180
Your face is covered with the blood
that's been splashing around.

311
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,350
Use this to wipe it off.

312
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,540
Your face is the one that's
covered with blood.

313
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,150
I said to wipe it off, damn it!

314
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,930
You won't be able to fight
if it gets into your eye!

315
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,440
Yeah, sorry...

316
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,500
It's true that you're as good as dead if
you lose your eyes on the battlefield.

317
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Right, you're done now.

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,480
It's over for you this time, damn snot.

319
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,830
H-Hey!

320
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,630
What is that?!

321
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,750
Why is his snot wiping his face?!

322
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,370
Why is the dirtiest part of his face
trying to wipe his face clean?!

323
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,950
Okay, I'm ready to go.

324
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,300
Let's do this, Toshi!

325
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,710
You aren't ready!

326
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,300
You're a complete mess!

327
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,830
Damn villains, it's on!

328
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,080
He has total control of his snot...

329
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,450
No, I would say that the
snot is controlling him...

330
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,320
What the hell?

331
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,370
What is that thing?

332
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,540
Stop it.

333
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,080
Stop abusing Kondo-san...

334
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,850
Get the hell out!

335
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,790
Look out!

336
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,180
Toshi!

337
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,600
Kondo-san!

338
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,940
Kondo-san!

339
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,810
The snot is gone...?

340
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,190
For deceiving you this whole time...

342
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,570
Toshi...

343
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,060
N-No way...

344
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,670
You're kidding me, the snot... You...

345
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,780
I am the true identity of Isao Kondo.

346
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,110
Snot Nebula 28...

347
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,110
[Note: Spoof of the Japanese hero Ultraman
and his home Nebula M78.]

348
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,440
That is my home galaxy.

349
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,080
I came to investigate Earth,

350
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,240
so I commandeered the body of a gorilla,

351
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,960
and altered my appearance to allow
me to live amongst humans.

352
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,590
That would be me, Isao Kondo.

353
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,870
Once my investigation was done, I was supposed
to be blown into a tissue and thrown away.

354
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,590
But before I knew it, five years,
ten years had passed...

355
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,450
The next thing I knew, I was
a middle-aged man.

356
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:32,260
I had so much fun with you guys...

357
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,720
Sno...

358
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,410
Kondo-san...

359
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:46,270
So everything I was trying to do to help
you would have destroyed you?

360
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,740
That's how it should be.

361
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,310
It's the fate of snot to be blown
into a tissue and throw away.

362
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,290
But...

363
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,680
I've lived too long...

364
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,470
I've grown too ugly and fat
to be kept inside a nose...

365
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,430
I wanted you to send me off...

366
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,070
Toshi, I wanted to be blown
into a tissue held by you...

367
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,440
Can you do me this favor...friend?

368
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,010
I'll come after you...

369
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,530
Next time, I'll also become snot...

370
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,210
I'll be waiting...

371
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,490
I'll be waiting in Otae-san's nostrils...

372
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,220
Like hell I'd follow you there!!

373
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,680
Talking snot is damn disgusting!

374
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,940
Toshi...

375
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,310
Your fly was open...

376
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,040
We're here, Toshi.

377
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,390
This is Ikezuya.

378
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,240
This will be an intense fight.

379
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,830
Stay focused.

380
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,380
Kondo-san...

381
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,730
Hmm? What is it?

382
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,970
Your snot's going Tarzan on you.

383
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,350
Oh, you're right.

384
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,410
[Teach us!! Ginpachi Sensei]

385
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,050
We have a question from someone
with the pen name Mutaito.

386
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,050
[Note: Based on the Master Roshi's
master from Dragon Ball.]

387
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,120
I have an uncle in his late 30s, a Madao.

388
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,200
The other day, he came
over to my house

389
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,920
and ended up staying in my room.

390
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,250
That night, around 2 AM,

391
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,150
[Note: Master Roshi's technique.]

392
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,150
Madao got completely naked and used a
full power Evil Containment Wave on me.

393
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,610
Mr. Ginpachi, please help him.

394
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,590
Okay, here's your answer.

395
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,750
He's beyond help.

396
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,900
Please get completely naked and use a full power
Evil Containment Wave to seal your uncle.

397
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,820
It's sad, but I believe it's the best
thing you can do for him.

398
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:57,950
So Mutaito-san, men in their late 30s are
a lot more childish than you realize.

399
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,050
They get worse as they age.

400
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,880
I would love to show you what's going on inside the
minds of the staff members who make this show.

401
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:16,810
[Preview]

402
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,740
A sunny and bright smile.

403
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,680
A demeanor soft as a spring breeze.

404
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,990
Ana Ketsuno, I turn to this channel every
morning just to see that smile.

405
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,810
I'll brave any danger to
protect that smile...

406
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,250
Whoa! But not this kind of danger !

407
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:18,670
The next episode...

408
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,930
"Not Losing to the Rain!"

409
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:25,270
[Gin-san is a huge fan of Ana Ketsuno,
the once divorced weather girl and face of Edo.]

410
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,900
[However, she has a surprising
other face as well.]

411
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,980
[See you next time.]
