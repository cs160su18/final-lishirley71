00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,060
I live for this stuff!

00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,110
One more, one more.

5
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,340
Say, Kagura-chan...

6
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,270
We've been having egg over
rice for how many days now?

7
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,640
No idea.

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,090
I don't dwell on the past.

9
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,320
No lingering on relationships that
are over. That's my motto.

10
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,000
Forget the past.
Look at the garbage disposal.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,370
It's filled with the remains of
the men you've dumped.

12
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,800
We've been having egg
over rice forever...

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,540
It's been egg over rice ever since
it's been your turn to cook.

14
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,460
Three straight days of egg over rice...

15
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,550
Hell, I'm starting to feel like
an egg poured over rice.

16
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,970
This morning, I was like...

17
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,510
"The eggs, the eggs are coming, rice!"

18
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,760
It tastes good, so who cares?

19
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,690
I can never get enough of this.

20
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,740
That's you.

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,320
That's because you reset your
brain every single day.

22
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,540
Because you lose your
saved game every day.

[Note: First town in the game
Dragon Quest 3 (DQ3).]

24
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,880
Because you start over from
Aliahan every day...

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,370
But y'know, men have a hard
time getting over these things.

26
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,220
When they're getting a puff-puff in Ashalam,
they remember their mothers.

This whole Aliahan narration
spiel starts flashing by.

32
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,140

[Note: Boss character in DQ3.]

35
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,230
It's time for the hero to leave the nest.

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,470
Time to hatch from its egg.

37
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,030
He should be glad I'm even making
food for him, stupid idiot.

38
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,930
Keeps nagging and nagging
like a mother-in-law.

39
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,770
Kagura-chan, egg over rice
certainly tastes good,

40
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,570
but having it every day is too much.

41
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,700
It's better when you only have
it once in a while.

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,180
You need to have a balanced diet.

43
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,320
That's right.

44
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,280
You could also try scrambled
eggs or rolled omelets.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,940
Those are still egg recipes, Sis!

46
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,840
I don't need anything besides
my egg over rice.

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,810
I can survive if I've got my
egg over rice with me.

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,620
It might be fine with you, Kagura-chan,

49
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,800
but once you're married,
your husband will have a hard time.

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,470
I'm never getting married.

51
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,910
I'm leeching off Odd Jobs forever.

52
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,530
Oh, so you're going to marry Gin-san?

53
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,830
Who would marry that good-for-nothing...

54
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,460
Then I'll marry the Colonel.

55
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,000
That old man has every chicken
under his control.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,590
All the eggs and fried chicken I can eat.

57
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,630
I'm pretty sure that the Colonel would
be against egg over rice every day.

58
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,770
You'll have a rough time
if you marry the Colonel.

59
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,910
If you don't keep him on a tight leash,
he'll gorge himself on fried foods.

60
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,680
The Colonel doesn't live on fried chicken.

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,470
That's his job!

62
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,490
You need to learn to make stuff like pork
cutlets and croquettes for a balanced diet.

63
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,440
Aren't those all fried?!

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,780
Are you trying to kill the Colonel?!

65
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,220
Kagura-chan, what do you think?

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,890
This is a good opportunity.

67
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,470

70
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,530
Actually, I was considering expanding
my cooking repertoire.

71
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,870
You don't get a chance to learn if your
mother dies when you're still young.

72
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,780
Can I marry the Colonel if
I learn how to cook here?

73
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,010
Yes, the Colonel will be mad about you.

74
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,770
He'll give you a fried ring at a fried
lounge bar while being fried.

75
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,170
What do you take the Colonel for?

00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,330
And Shinpachi, why are you here?

77

If I don't expand my repertoire,
nothing will change.

78
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,150
There will only be more completely
burned objects.

79
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,770
Did you say something, Shin-chan?

80

Oh, Kyubei-san.

I came because you told
me to, but what is this?

Am I supposed to learn how to cook?

This is one request I cannot follow...

87
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,580
You'll also end up being someone's bride,
so you should learn how to cook.

88
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,110
I will never become a bride.

89
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,100
If you insist, I would rather take Otae-chan
or Ronald as my bride.

90
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,320
Now it's Ronald?!

You girls must really love junk food!

have all the french fries I want every day.

anything and everything between two buns.

He'll end up sticking mother-in-law and sister-in-law
between two buns and terrible things will happen.

Just to be clear, Mito Natto is famous,

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:22,730
Since this is our first class, I'll have
you show me how skilled you are.

158
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,000
Cooking may be about love,

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,100
but I don't want to waste my time on little
girls who have never held a knife before.

160
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,470
I shall be testing you now.

161
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:40,000
Cook any food to your liking and
the team with the worst result

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,230
will immediately be kicked out!

163
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,050
She is so staring right at us!

164
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,840
Well, everyone!

165
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,650
Pour all of your knowledge
and love into your cooking!

166
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,010
I will witness everything you do right
and everything you do wrong.

167
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,630
I won't miss a thing!

168
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,660
Now begin!

169
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,370
How's this?

170
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,750
Hmm...

171
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,570
Sh-She hasn't budged an inch.

172
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,630
We've been marked.

173
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,200
She's got her eyes on us!

174
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,950
The teacher fully intends to get rid of us!

175
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,160
Good grief, I came here
to learn how to cook,

176
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,220
so I didn't expect this to happen first.

177
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,560
There's no other way.

178
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,000
We'll have to work together.

179
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,610
I'm not very confident in our technique,

180
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,430
but they can't beat us when
it comes to love.

181
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,710
Fine by me!

182
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,450
I'll show them my love for the Colonel!

183
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,840
No, for Ronald.

184
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,630
For Mito's anus.

185
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,380
I'm sorry, but...

186
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,700
You're all over the place, and your
love is for ridiculous reasons...

187
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,880
That's true.

188
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,080
We can't win if we're divided.

189
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,530
Beggars can't be choosers.

190
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,320
We'll compromise and go with
Inaba from the rock duo B'z.

191
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,610
Why?!

192
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,880
How do you wind up getting Inaba-san
out of Mito's anus?!

193
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,220
You clearly chose him
for your own reasons!

194
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,420
Like an office lady's taste in
men from a decade ago!

195
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,740
Don't give me that crap!

196
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,600
I said I wanted Mito's anus!

197
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,430
Fine.

198
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,180
I'll do whatever Otae-chan wants.

199
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,940
We'll go with Inaba-san's asshole.

200
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,210
Why asshole?!

201
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,990
You're mixing in the anus talk!

202
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,850
Hey! What happened to the Colonel?!

203
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,110
Let's merge Inaba and the Colonel!

204
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,440
Hey! That doesn't matter at this point!

205
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,390
Let's start cooking!

206
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,670
It certainly matters!

207
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,620
Cooking is about love!

208
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,430
The key isn't what you make.

209
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,200
The key is who you're making
it for. Didn't you hear me?

210
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,550
That may be the key, Teach,

211
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,260
but Inaba-san and Komon-san
aren't here!

212
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,160
They won't be eating our cooking!

213
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,650
If we're talking B'z, I prefer Matsumoto
over Inaba! So manly!

214
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,820
And it helps that he looks like
Ken Shimura, the comedian!

215
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,030
What are we even trying
to choose here?!

216
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,330
Why not go with Ken Shimura
to begin with?!

217
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,710
Then if I win rock, paper,
scissors, it's Inaba-san.

218
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,850
If Kagura-chan wins,
Ken Shimura will do.

219
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,170
No, something's wrong with that.

220
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,010
It's wrong to separate those two.

221
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,280
B'z only works when the two
of them are combined!

222
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,980
Combining the two of them
won't give you B'z!

223
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,560
Understood. Then I'll do this.

224
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,220
If Otae-chan wins, it's B'z.

225
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,500
If I win, it's WANDS.

226
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,500
[Note: Japanese band from the 90's that was
from the same record company as B'z.]

227
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,110
Where did WANDS come from?!

228
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,940
[Note: Dragon Ball GT ending song by WANDS.]

229
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,120
Do you people want me to take a rusty
machine gun and shoot you down?!

230
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,480
This will never end at this rate.

231
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,910
We should forget about B'z for now.

232
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,880
Something similar to B'z...

233
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh, then we can go with the Drifterz.

234
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,560
[Note: The Drifters, music/comic
group from the 70's.]

235
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,900
How are they similar?!

236
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,310
You just stuck a 'z' in there
so it would look similar!

237
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,640
Then we'll go with KEN from Drifterz.

238
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,750
[Note: Kato Cha, a member from the Drifters.]

239
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,750
CHA would also make a fine choice.

240
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,220
There are no such flashy
members in the Drifters!

241
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,120
It's just Ken Shimura!

242
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,230
Hey!

243
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,610
So after all that talking, we
end up with Ken Shimura?!

244
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,090
What are you doing?!

245
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,500
Everyone else has started cooking!

246
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,280
There are ingredients over there
so make whatever you want.

247
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,580
Yes, make something that would
make KEN very happy.

248
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,400
I said KEN isn't here!
KEN won't be eating!

249
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,350
Shut up! Zip it, little twerp!

250
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,580
Can we just salt up this watermelon?

251
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,260
He likes quick snacks.

252
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,110
That wouldn't be considered cooking!

253
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,780
I'm sorry to bring this up now, everyone...

254
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,970
But...

255
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,390
Can we drop KEN for CHA?

256
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,440
You're still on that subject?!

257
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,560
Didn't we agree to drop
that ridiculous topic?!

258
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,730
We know that KEN loves his liquor, but nobody
knows what his favorite foods are.

259
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,470
But CHA, on the other hand,
would be simple.

260
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,990
CHA-han, as in fried rice.

261
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,250
That's just a pun!

262
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,190
I see, it's perfect for CHA!

263
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,850
You're brilliant, Kyu-chan!

264
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,590
No, she's just trying to be clever!

265
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,410
It has nothing to do with CHA!

266
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,110
But I'd feel bad if we ditched KEN now.

267
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,010
Enough of that!

268
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,090
Then we can just go with
KATO-chan KEN-cha-han.

269
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,920
Hello?!

270
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,770
Yep! You need both of them
for KATOKEN to work!

271
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,210
Nobody cares!

272
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,470
Nobody at all!

273
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,820
Cut it out already!

274
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,240
What did we come here for anyway?!

275
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,930
For now, we have green onions,
pork, eggs, the basics.

276
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,270
The question is how do we spice it up?

277
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,970
We can add shrimp or scallops
for a seafood flair...

278
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,700
If we add kimchi, we'll
have kimchi fried rice.

279
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,730
What do we do?

280
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,910
What do KATO-chan
and KEN-chan like?

281
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,720
No clue.

282
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,050
Don't give me that!

283
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,600
You're the ones who decided
that they like cha-han rice!

284
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,840
We haven't made any progress at all!

285
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,610
Let's go with seafood.

286
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,210
Toss in wakame and kombu!

287
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,550
Hey! Hold it!

288
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,910
KEN has a receding hairline.

289
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,100
He needs plenty of seaweed
for minerals!

290
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,970
Yeah, but that looks horrible!

291
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,040
It looks like a wig!

292
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,940
You're so annoying.

293
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm wishing for KEN's head
to end up like this!

294
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,730
Then we should also throw in nori?

295
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,630
Not needed! We have enough black!

296
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,120
Then we'll top it off with
something Rxxe21-like.

297
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,890
Rxxe21-like?! That's clearly
Rxxe21 in your hand!

298
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,210
It's not edible! It isn't seafood!

299
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,140
All creatures were born
from the mother sea.

300
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,850
Rxxe21 wouldn't count!

301
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,460
Is this fried rice solely for the
purpose of growing hair?!

302
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,180
It'd be faster to stick kombu
on KEN's head!

303
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,160
That's right!

304
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,760
I've been standing here quietly
while you all go on about KEN!

305
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,930
Just to be clear!

306
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,950
This fried rice is KATO-chan
KEN-cha-han rice!

307
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,960
KATO-chan is also here!

308
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,550
KATO-chan and KEN-chan have
to be together for B'z to work!

309
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,920
They aren't B'z!

310
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,050
What the hell do you think B'z is?!

311
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,790
Then Sarutobi-san...

312
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,440
Let me ask you. What can
we do for KATO-chan?

313
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
What are you talking about?

314
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
He has plenty of hair. Lots of money.

315
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,240
Popular with the girls. Isn't
he already happy?

316
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,310
So? You could say the same about KEN,
besides that he's balding.

317
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,080
KEN, despite his balding...

318
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,730
Has this really cool blog...

319
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,070
What's wrong with that?!

320
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,360
You can't have a cool blog
if you're balding?!

321
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,790
What's the problem?!

322
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,160
Despite the fact that he's a weird
old man on the outside,

323
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,400
he's totally cool on the inside.

324
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,640
He isn't anything like a weird old man.

325
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,520
He isn't harumph at all...

326
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,940
He's so harumph!

327
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,660
What's wrong with that?!

328
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,520
That's the point!

329
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,820
That makes him cool!

330
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,710
So he wasn't "fine and dandy" at all...

331
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,880
I'm sorry.

332
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,920
I had no idea.

333
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,630
I have no idea why you're apologizing!

334
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,660
But...

335
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,590
Is it okay if I say something?

336
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,800
KATO-chan, at his age...

337
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,250
Gets completely naked
when he takes a crap...

338
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,760
Isn't that taboo?

339
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,200
I'm sorry... I had no idea...

340
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,240
How could you possibly
know that anyway?!

341
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,540
KATO-chan and KEN-chan
are hurting and tired...

342
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,650
How?!

343
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,480
If only we could make some cha-han
rice to cheer them up...

344
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,230
But we're so useless...

345
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,080
A little girl who's rarely used
a knife in the kitchen

346
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,920
could never cook anything full
of love to cheer someone up...

347
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,530
We had no chance from the beginning...

348
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,660
What's with the gloomy mood?

349
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,360
How did we go from KATO-chan
pooping naked to this?

350
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,960
Why is Kyubei-san joining in?

351
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,130
It isn't impossible!

352
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,490
Mentaiko?

353
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,700
Teacher, we're done!

354
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,880
Please try it.

355
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,710
[KATO SHIMURA
"Go get 'em"]

356
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,750
Disgusting.

357
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
But...

358
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,980
If I were KATO-chan KEN-chan,

359
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,790
I couldn't accept this.

360
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,730
Now get going.

361
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,600
I have nothing to teach you.

362
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,250
Cooking is about love.

363
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,930
Never forget those words.

364
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,380
Okay!

365
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,440
We did it!

366
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,380
We've been titled masters.

367
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,200
A master, huh?

368
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,540
Now Gin-chan can't complain!

369
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,780
Teacher, who is this?

370
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,990
That's what I want to know.

371
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,210
Who is KATO-chan KEN-chan?

372
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,370
No idea...

373
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,250
In any case, it's a good thing you
got rid of those nuisances.

374
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,250
Let's repeat it, so we don't forget.

375
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,610
Good idea.

376
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,700
Cooking is about...

377
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,590
Love!

378
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,250
Hopeless.

379
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,360
Boy, the year's already over, huh?

380
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,530
Sure was fast.

381
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:26,450
I hate how the year goes
by faster as we get older.

382
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,570
At this rate, by the time I'm an old geezer

383
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,740
the years will pass at the
speed of a Formula 1 car.

384
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,880
I've still got a long ways to go.

385
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:44,440
Well, I'm already up to Ben
Johnson speed, I'd say.

386
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,850
My Ben Johnson is already up to here.

387
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,450
Don't get too cocky because
you're all still young.

388
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,920
Your Ben Johnson will fall
behind soon enough.

389
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,040
For real?

390
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,390
Ben Johnson's gonna fall out??

391
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,680
I prefer Carl Lewis over Ben Johnson.

392
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,750
He's cooler.

393
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,820
Well, all I'm saying is,

394
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,210
we all had a pretty good year, right?

395
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,730
Hell no!

396
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,960
It's still January!

397
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,390
And haven't we had the exact same
conversation three years in a row?!

398
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,890
That's 'cause this whole
segment was recycled.

399
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,660
Yeah.

400
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,910
Not just the lines either.
The video's the same, too.

401
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,490
Your lines are exactly the same
as the ones from last year!

402
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,450
Well, you know...

403
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,540
They've been working
hard on this anime.

404
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,570
But you know...

405
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,500
It's the end of the year and they're
also working on the movie.

406
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,110
The staff's gotten used to slacking at
a TV schedule the last four years.

407
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,910
It doesn't take long for them
to run out of steam.

408
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,700
They're the type you expect

409
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,860
to start clutching their stomachs before they've
even left the starting area of a marathon.

410
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,410
Nobody wants to hear about
whining behind the scenes.

411
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,370
Besides, this is why you usually
have another team ready to go, right?

412
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,620
That's how all the other anime do it.

413
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,110
Well, come April, the movie will be complete
and the TV series will end.

414
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,290
We can all rest easy.

415
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,040
Not only can we rest easy,
but we'll all be unemployed.

416
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,920
Yeah, we won't be able to laugh
at Hasegawa-san anymore.

417
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,340
Uh, wait...

418
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,540
Did you just say that the
TV series will end?

419
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,720
The show's ending in April?

420
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,210
What are you saying, Pachi-boy?

421
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,450
Didn't we say that we were entering
the final arc back in episode 125?

422
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,650
I only tell the truth.

423
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,880
Grown adults would never
lie about ending a show...

424
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,890
Hold on!

425
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,330
Who would remember something
you said a year ago?!

426
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,420
Entering the final stage of the final arc.

427
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,330
And so, I'm sure that some of you were wondering
about the number by the title this week.

428
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,490
I shall explain now!

429
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,490
A countdown really began back
when we said it would.

430
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,140
Huh? Really?

431
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,930
Well, at one point, we realized that we miscounted,
so we counted 19 twice to hide that fact.

432
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,320
You just told everybody!

433
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,870
Why is this final little gimmick
still half-assed?!

434
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,200
But this time, we're telling the
truth about this show ending.

435
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,550
The boy who cried wolf was
telling the truth in the end.

436
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,220
Though that was when he died.

437
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,620
And we only have a few numbers
left in this new year.

438
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,780
But I don't really like having a movie
right after the TV show ends.

439
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,230
Like how those recent TV dramas do it?

440
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,470
Air a wishy-washy final episode and go,
"To be continued in the movie."

441
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,520
The TV show ends up feeling
like a promotion for the movie.

442
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,090
That's insulting the viewers who've
been watching every week!

443
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,920
I would never go see
one of those movies!

444
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,380
You'd better not be fooled by
these sneaky ticket sets!

445
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,180
Wait!

446
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,790
Why is that the only footage that's new?!

447
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,450
And it has nothing to do with the movie!

448
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,110
Besides, movie previews these days
are just a bunch of tempting scenes.

449
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,700
We're going to be playing a
commercial right after this,

450
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,350
so you'd better not be fooled.

451
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,940
Yeah, something like this!

452
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,070
