Boom!

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,690
Wh-What?!

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,170
Watch TV in a well-lit room and
don't sit too close to the screen.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,860
Huh?! Where's the TV?!

6
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,480
Oof.

[OTOSE SNACK HOUSE]

8
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,600
Good morning, Tama.

9
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,340
Good morning, Otose-sama.

10
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,820
Unlike Catherine, you work very hard.

11
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,820
Making yourself busy bright
and early every morning...

12
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,650
You could sleep in a little
longer, you know.

13
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,330
We don't open till nighttime.

14
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,380
In my case, sleep does not serve as
a method of replenishing my energy.

15
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,600
I can function normally on only
a little recharge and oil.

16
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,110
So please do not concern yourself.

17
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,120
Sleep is the kind of thing that's
beneficial without feeling like it is.

18
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,210
People and machines need time
to rest and clear their minds.

19
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,330
Eat, sleep, and play.

20
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,360
The things we take for granted are
more important than you think.

21
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,270
If you don't maintain a stable foundation,

22
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,110
you'll end up like those losers upstairs.

23
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,910
Catching colds all the time,

24
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,840
upsetting their stomachs,

25
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,170
feeling under the weather
all year round...

26
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,180
A robot can't catch a cold.

27
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,730
Please do not concern yourself.

28
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,310
You won't catch a cold,

29
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,640
but aren't you feeling a little
under the weather?

30
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,380
You've been working non-stop
the past few days.

31
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,330
An occasional trip to a hot springs...

32
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,640
Won't work, but how about
soaking yourself in oil?

33
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,540
Otose-sama.

34
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,110
Thank you very much for always
being concerned about me.

35
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,470
But I'm truly fine.

36
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,520
The fact that I'm able to work
here with everyone...

37
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,450
The fact that I can be
here with everyone...

38
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,290
Is enough to make me happy.

39

["Smooth Polygons Smooth Men's Hearts Too"]

40
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,030
Eh? Something's wrong with Tama?

41
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,940
Yes... It may have just been
the light playing tricks on me,

42
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,200
but her face looked odd for a moment.

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,990
Her face looked odd for a moment?

44
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,510
Better than looking odd 24/7.

45
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,580
That's right.

46
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,290
It beats having a face that looks like
a cicada husk 24/7 the way you do.

47
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,260
It reminded me of those fighting games
from a while back, all jagged...

48
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,080
What were they called again?

49
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,960
Polygons?

50
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,830
Yes, yes. Her face was all jagged
like it was made of polygons.

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,640
I'm sure she's tired after working so hard.

52
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,170
Could you check if any screws
are loose or anything?

53
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,130
First, you should go see a doctor
for the screws loose in your head.

54
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,700
How could a little breakdown make
a puppet look like polygons?

55
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,230
How could a machine get tired?

56
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,180
I saw it with my own eyes.

57
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,800
H-Hey...

58
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,160
What's with your face...

59
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,540
What do you mean?

60
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,060
No, it's all jagged.

61
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,220
Not just your face. Your
whole body's all jagged!

62
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,740
I am sorry. I cannot comprehend
what Otose-sama is saying.

63
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,990
No, this should be easy to understand!

64
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,080
It's in plain sight!

65
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,460
She has worked too hard
the past few days.

66
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,280
I was worried, so I kept telling
her to take a break.

67
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,000
It was probably an optical illusion.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,140
Something that ridiculous
could never happen.

69
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,230
You're the one who's tired.

70
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,550
Your time's coming.

71
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,990
I have returned.

72
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,040
Welcome back. Thanks for...

73
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,780
Ah, Master Gintoki.

74
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,340
Good morning.

75
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,700
Forget polygons!
She's down to pixels now!

76
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,290
Tama completed her errand.

77
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,590
230 experience gained.

78
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,610
300 G lost.

79
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,130
Even the speech bubbles
are NES-level!

80
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,810
Otose-sama.

81
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,140
Sorry for the wait.

82
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,190
The supermarket was crowded
because of a sale.

83
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,590
And she's facing forward regardless of
the direction she's moving, like a crab!

84
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,070
The way it was in the first Dragon Quest!

85
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,190
It's creepy!

86
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,720
I can hear that sad song they
played in Radatom Castle!

87
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,240
Here, Otose-sama.

88
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,970
These are the goods you requested.

89
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,090
Tama handed over a medicinal herb.

90
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,140
There is no response. It's just a corpse.

91
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,140
[Note: This is a reference to a famous
line from Dragon Quest.]

92
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,340
Who are you calling a "corpse"?!

93
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,340
And I never asked for medicinal herbs!

94
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,500
Tama handed over a cypress stick.

95
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,790
I didn't ask for that either!

96
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,900
Which item store did you even go to?!

97
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,040
There is no response.

98
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,360
It's just a corpse.

99
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,500
Don't try to play dumb!

100
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,680
Tama-san!

101
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,950
How did you end up like this?!

102
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,950
What in the world happened?!

103
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,350
I'm so sorry, Tama!

104
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:02,720
You must have broken down because
I worked you too hard!

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
Gin-chan, fix her already.

106
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,740
It's dangerous when she's
all jagged like this.

107
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,850
People will cut themselves.

108
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,320
You should fix her into a form that's
completely round and child safe.

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,180
What's wrong with leaving her like this?

110
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,650
There isn't that much difference.

111
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,560
Hell yes, there is!

112
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,470
Just look!

113
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,660
Her legs are still moving while
she's quietly standing here!

114
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,700
She only has two available poses,

115
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,470
one with her right leg up and
one with her left leg up!

116
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,760
It'll be fine.

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,080
She'll get the pose where

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,420
[Note: Refers to Princess Laura
from Dragon Quest game.]

119
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,420
she's carrying a princess after
she rescues Princess Laura.

120
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,630
Princess Laura doesn't exist in this world!

121
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,980
Appearances aside, she
was always this useless.

122
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,710
Who cares if she stays this way?

123
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,480
Besides, you young'uns are too
used to CG and 3D rendering.

124
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,810
Pixels are classic.

125
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,880
Uh, what are you talking about?

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,380
Back in our day, we couldn't
wait to explore dungeons

127
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,980
that consisted of just straight lines.

128
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,900
There wasn't any pretty CG, but we
let our imaginations run the show.

129
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,920
Uh, so what are you talking about?

130
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,230
Sure, the first time I turned the power on,

131
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,520
I was a little disappointed with the flashy cover
art not matching the actual in-game screens.

132
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,170
I was like, that's it?

133
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,590
But by the time I reached the ending
credits, I felt like I was the hero!

134
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,710
I was so touched when I saw the
word "you" in the cast credits.

135
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,190
Uh, what are you...

136
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,540
But nowadays, they play these
long-ass CG cut scenes.

137
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,590
Are we trying to watch a movie?

138
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,580
No, right?

139
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,980
We want to play a game!

140
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,940
No!

141
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,180
How did this turn into a discussion
about gaming?!

142
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,630
Got it?

143
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,340
Games don't play you! You play games!

144
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,870
We don't need any CG or movies!

145
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,600
You wanna let them lead you around?!

146
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,330
Do you have no imagination?!

147
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,770
Pixel graphics!

148
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,770
Events that are text-only!

149
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,920
That's all you need!

150
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,160
That's enough. Just shut up.

151
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,870
The Wizardry generation can go scour
their dungeons for Muramasa.

152
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,870
[Note: Wizardry was a 1980s game. Swords
named Muramasa often show up in games.]

153
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,120
You probably don't think you can fix her.

154
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,710
I get it. I won't ask you.

155
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,080
Pathetic.

156
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,230
As pathetic as a man who can't
hook up a DVD player.

157
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,780
As pathetic as a man who screams
when he sees a cockroach.

158
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,090
As pathetic as a man who still has
his mommy buy his underwear.

159
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,260
Seriously, what's with the adults
who get all nostalgic

160
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,840
when they start talking about games?

161
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,760

What kind of wounds am I supposed
to heal with that?!

164
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,780
Hey, you shouldn't look down
on the Wizardry generation.

165
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,650
I could fix this in a second if I wanted to.

166
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,240
Fine. If you're gonna be that way, fine.

167
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,380
I'll fix her.

168
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,910
Really?

169
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,520
Just watch, polygon generation.

170
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,970
I'll show you the power of
the Wizardry generation.

You didn't fix anything!

Why are you trying to go through
events text-only like in Wizardry?!

182
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,980
You think it's okay to use
only text in an anime?!

183
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,340
The screen won't last!

You can't fix anything like that!

I gave the viewers the freedom
to imagine how she was fixed.

186

That's the Wizardry way.

187

You're just being lazy!

188

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,830
A cold?

200
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,040
How can a robot catch a cold?

201
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,080
It would be more accurate to say that
she's caught a computer virus.

202
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,570
A computer virus?

203
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:01,320
An illegal program that roams the
virtual world destroying data.

204
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:09,070
She was probably infected when she connected
to the Internet for her work.

205
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,490
So the computer virus has destroyed
Tama-san's program,

206
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,400
which is why she's behaving this way.

207
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,370
Hey now.

208
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,780
We finally recovered from our colds,

209
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,000

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,850
Old geezer, you can fix Tama, right?

211
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,440
You can put her back to normal, right?

212
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,080
A commercial anti-virus program would
be enough to deal with ordinary viruses,

213
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,110
but she's got an especially tough one.

214
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,290
The computer virus "Tapir."

215
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,020
A brand-new virus that infects the program,
consumes it, and multiplies.

216
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,700
Tapir reads the data from
the system it has infected

217
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,350
while rewriting its own program.

218
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,330
It evolves, becoming more
efficient as it multiplies

219
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,200
and more deeply embedded in its victim.

220
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,640
A Tapir infection caught early
on can be easily dealt with,

221
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,790
but one that's been evolving over an extended
period will be more difficult to remove.

222
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,160
And the Tapir virus will be as strong
as the system it has infected.

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,680
Once it infected Tama, who
is a highly advanced robot,

224
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,420
it must have evolved a great deal.

225
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,440
And it's been there for a while.

226
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,140
Nobody can do anything about it.

227
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,930
It's evolved into the strongest
and worst virus ever.

228
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,530
N-No way...

229
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,690
Even you, Gengai-san, can't fix her...

230
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,790
Don't be ridiculous.

I'm the top robot technician in Edo.

There's nothing I can't do.

233
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,150
However...

234
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,990
We're dealing with a brand-new virus.

235
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,960
It'll take some time to make a vaccine.

236
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,800
By the time I finish, Tama will have
been completely consumed.

237
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,510
She'll be a robot with no soul.

238
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,810
No way...

239
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,730
But there's still a way to save Tama.

240
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,840
What?

241
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,210
Let us hear it, old geezer.

242
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,420
It'll be a dangerous gamble.

243
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,350
For Tama...

244
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,050
And for all of you...

245
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,670
It doesn't matter.

246
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,920
Just tell us.

247
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,180
Should I interpret that response to mean

248
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,790
that you're willing to risk
your lives for Tama?

249
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,120
Think what you will.

250
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,280
Just tell us already.

251
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,510
Huh? What's this?

00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,550
What's this robot doing?

Th-This means Gin-san's...

258
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,070
This... This is...!

259
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,270

260
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,040
Who is this?

261
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,390
I don't like this.

262
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,350
G-Gengai-san?!

263
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,720
What is this?!

264
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,310
Why is Gin-san so tiny?!

265
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,580
The magic mallet Z503.

266
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,580
[Note: Parody of legendary Japanese
hammer, Uchide-no-Kozuchi.]

267
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,900
It sends super magnetic waves
through the object it hits

268
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,030
and shrinks the target's cells
and the target itself.

269
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,200
A high-tech weapon created by yours truly.

270
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,910
You're joking, right?

271
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm wrong, right?

272
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't tell me you're going
to smash us with...

273
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,490
S-Stop!

274
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,450
Don't add to your crimes!

275
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,870
What can you possibly accomplish
by doing this?!

276
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,550
Why are you doing this?!

277
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,040
Shouldn't that be obvious?

278
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,190
We're going to eliminate the virus.

279
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,400
Not through a vaccine or an anti-virus.

280
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,080
You midgets are doing it.

281
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,970
Best of luck to you.

282
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,690
You jerk!

283
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,030
Gin-san.

284
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,550
Can we trade off already?

285
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,640
Don't give me that crap.

286
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,530
We just switched.

287
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,120
Once you're old,

288

[Note: Parody of Book Off, a
chain of used bookstores.]

289
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,890
you'll be willing to buy back the hardships
during your youth at a Book-Hoff.

290
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,240
Even if they're used.

291
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,540
It's extremely tiring to row through oil.

292
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,800
I'm hungry.

293
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,120
You think any half-eaten
food will float by?

294
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,580
No, robots don't eat food.

295
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,800
Where are we right now?

296
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,670
We entered through her mouth,

297
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,120
so we're probably somewhere
around the stomach.

298
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,480
Does a robot even have a stomach?

299
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,560
I don't know.

300
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,940
Where are we even headed
to begin with?

301
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,220
I don't know.

302
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,590
How can you not know?!
What are we supposed to do?!

303
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,210
He turns us into midgets all of a sudden,
tells us to defeat the virus,

304
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,860
and throws us into her mouth?!

305
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,660
We don't know how to defeat
the virus or where it even is!

306
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,430
Don't take it out on me.

307
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,240
This is all Gengai-san's fault.

308
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,460
That stupid old man...

309
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,570
Why am I the only one with two?

310
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,230
Well?

311
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,700
I call it Operation Midget.

312
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,550
That's so bland.

313
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,460
Use a little more imagination.

314
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:23,290
You're going to enter Tama's body
and treat her from the inside.

315
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,640
Uh...

316
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,610
We don't know anything about
robots, so what do we do?

317
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,200
I was expecting you to ask that.

318
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,030
Use these. Here.

319
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,640
Isn't this just a toothpick?!

320
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,980
Old geezer! You sure you didn't
just want to play with midgets?!

321
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,810
Don't mistake those for
ordinary toothpicks.

322
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,780
They've been modified.

323
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,320
Gin-no-ji, push on the base
of your toothpick.

324
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,890
Eh?

325
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,500
Like we can count on your modifications
to be worth anything.

326
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,800
The last time...

327
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,340
Gin-no-ji! Push on your
wooden sword's grip!

328
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,820
It dispenses soy sauce.

329
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,720
So, why soy sauce?!

330
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,780
Don't worry.

331
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,910
My technical skills have
improved since then.

332
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,870
Go ahead. Push it.

333
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,440
Tch, I'm not expecting anything...

334
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,860
But I'll give it a shot!

335
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,110
It's dashi soy sauce.

336
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,110
[Note: Dashi is bonito fish stock.]

337
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,300
How have your technical skills
improved, stupid old geezer?!

338
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,530
Woohoo! My egg rice will be tastier now!

339
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,830
Shut up! You turn into soy sauce!

340
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,820
Stop griping and get going.

341
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,580
Hey! Why a bowl?!

342
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,470
You just want to play with midgets!

343
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,220
It's important to have atmosphere.

344
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,510
It's all sticky.

345
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,570
This must be some kind of special
coating to make it easier

346
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,870
to enter Tama-san's body...

347
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,170
It's the bowl I just used to eat natto.

348
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,170
[Note: Natto is fermented soybeans.]

349
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,990
I'm gonna strangle you!

350
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,910
You'll be going through the mouth.

351
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,160
Godspeed, you three.

352
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,470
Damn old geezer...

353
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,080
What are we supposed
to do with a toothpick?!

354
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,220
It can't even remove the squid
stuck between my teeth...

355
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,010
Hey, it got it.

356
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,240
It's actually useful!

357
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,330
Thanks, old geezer!

358
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,620
Like I'm actually going to say that!

359
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,060
Die, you damn old fart!

360
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,500
Choke on some squid and die!

361
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,790

gadget and shoving us into hell!

362

[Note: Parody of Doraemon.]

363
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,730
If I ever get out of here, I'm going inside
him and exiting through his urethra

364
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,290
while slashing this toothpick around!

365
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,260
Yeah, yeah. That's enough whining.

366
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,190
This is the only way to save Tama-san.

367
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,320
We don't have a choice.

368
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,680
That's right.

369
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,840
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

370
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,270
You can't reach the urinary uvula

371
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,110
without passing through
the palatine uvula.

372
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,260
Uh, Tama-san doesn't have one.

373
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,730
But her name means "balls."

374
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,520
Get over it!

375
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,120
I can see land!

376
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,590
I wonder where we are.

377
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,310
We entered through the mouth and
passed through the stomach,

378
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,560
so we're probably near the entrance
to the small intestine.

379
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,770
Does a robot even have
a small intestine?

380
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,780
I don't know.

381
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,110
Will this really work?

382
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,070
We'll just have to look around.

383
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,330
We can enter the small intestine
and head towards the anus.

384
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,490
And does a robot even have an anus?

385
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,270
I don't know.

386
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,820
We don't have a choice.

387
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,290
It's not like we can gather information when
there aren't any people around...

388
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,550
There's one!

389
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,740
There's someone here!

390
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,550
Why?!

391
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,870
Why is there a person inside Tama-san?!

392
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,080
And why is he wearing a bodysuit?!

393
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,490
I don't really get it, but I'll take
whatever I can get right now.

394
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,150
We can ask him.

395
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,900
Hold on!

396
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,170
Gin-san! It's dangerous!

397
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,280
Uh, excuse me.

398
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,990
Uh, sorry to disturb your nap,

399
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,630
but I need to ask a few questions.

400
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,320
Uh, do you live here?

401
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,790
We're on a company trip and
this is our first time here,

402
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,290
so we don't know our way around.

403
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,520
Uh, excuse me...

404
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,940
There's an arrow sticking
out of your rear...

405
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,760
Are you okay?

406
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,940
Greetings, travelers.

407
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,010
Fortune must be smiling on me to bring me an
encounter with you as I lie on my deathbed.

408
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,260
Lie on your deathbed? You just
have an arrow in your ass.

409
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,850
Please listen to my last request.

410
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,680
Uh, could you listen to me first?

411
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,990
It's just an arrow in your ass.

412
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,490
I bequeath you to carry
a message to my king.

413
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,280
King?

414
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,730
It saddens me to say that
our leukocyte army

415
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,860
has fallen to the virus army.

416
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,500
This world will soon fall into
the hands of the Tapir.

417
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,610
I pray that our king takes flight.

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,220
someone with the pen name
Cherry Blossom Samurai.

426
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,000
Hello.

427
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,220
I'm having a hard time drawing
Gin-san's dead fish eyes.

428
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,020
Please tell me if there's a trick to it.

429
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,920
Okay. Here's your answer.

430
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,780
Basically, you need to separate
the eyebrows from the eyes.

431
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,950
And draw heavy eyelids.

432
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,220
You should only be able
to see half of his pupils.

433
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,310
Okay, all done.

434
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,160
Then you bring the eyebrows
and eyes closer together

435
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,920
and sharpen the eyelids.

436

There you go. A serious-looking Gin-san.
