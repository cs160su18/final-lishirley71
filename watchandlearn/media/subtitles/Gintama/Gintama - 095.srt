Can you and I start over...?

It's the Kinniku Buster! Kinniku Buster!

I'm the attorney, Sakata.

18
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,330
Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,560
Gin-san?

20
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,660
We will now start the trial.

["Men, Be A Madao"]

22
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,320
On February 21st at 7:25, the defendant Taizo Hasegawa,

23
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,360
forcefully grabbed the hand of the victim, Ms. A, on the platform at Kabukicho station

24
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,160
and dragged her down into the railway.

25
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,690
He is suspected of performing a Kinniku Buster in front of everyone.

26
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,420
This is clearly an act of molestation and assault.

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,700
And depending on the circumstances, it may even be considered attempted murder.

28
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,880
Many people on the platform witnessed the defendant's actions.

29
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,990
Without even having to examine him, it is clear that the defendant is guilty.

30
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,740
Objection!

31
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,150
Defense Attorney Sakata.

32
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,040
It is true that the defendant performed a Kinniku Buster on the victim.

33
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:29,120
[Kinniku Buster Molestation Case - Exhibit 1]
[Note: Image is a spoof of the first appearance of Kinniku Buster in Ultimate Muscle.]

34
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:29,120
However whether he did this with the intent to molest

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,310
is still questionable.

36
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,330
There is a strong possibility that this incident was an accident.

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,430
The defendant almost fell off the platform and

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,020
accidentally performed a Kinniku Buster on the girl.

39
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,160
Therefore, I plead the defendant is not guilty.

40
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,810
Gin-san!

41
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,160
He's laying into him.

42
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,680
He's totally laying into Haga!

43
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,730
Accidentally?

44
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,200
Do you seriously think a complicated move like the Kinniku Buster

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,140
can be performed accidentally?

46
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,000
Apparently, the defense is unaware of how hard Kinnikuman

47
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,830
had to work to come up with that move.

48
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,010
Objection!

49
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,820
In the first place, it's wrong to equate the Kinniku Buster as an act of molestation.

50
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,100
The Kinniku Buster was used by Kinnikuman to destroy the evil super humans.

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,580
I cannot imagine that Kinnikuman had perverted intentions

52
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,360
when using this move against the giant super humans.

53
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,350
Besides...

54
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,540
The move performed by the defendant is not the Kinniku Buster.

55
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,520
The Kinniku Buster is called that because it's done by Kinnikuman.

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,170
The correct name for the move performed by the defendant, Taizo Hasegawa,

57
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,870
should be the Hasegawa Buster.

58
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,200
Objection!

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,510
The Kinniku Buster got its name when Kinnikuman perfected it.

60
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,340
Therefore, no matter who uses it, it should still be called the Kinniku Buster.

61
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,400
Objection!

62
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,850
The Kinniku Buster is one of 48 deadly moves that Prince Kamehame taught Kinnikuman.

63
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,190
Kinnikuman was not the one who came up with it.

64
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,340
When others used the move, the users' name preceded the move.

65
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,840
For example, when Ashuraman used this move, it was called the Ashura Buster.

66
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,980
I will allow the objection.

67
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,930
Damn.

68
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,850
From here on, the Kinniku Buster will be called the Hasegawa Buster.

69
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,100
A-Amazing!

70
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,490
It was a totally meaningless exchange,

71
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,840
yet he managed to win against a professional.

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,390
As expected from a guy who can talk himself out of anything!

73
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,380
Look how cool he looks.

74
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,280
Now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen him lose an argument.

75
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,740
[As Expected]
[Note: The first character actually says 'sugar' and is not the correct kanji to use for this word.]

76
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,320
This may just work.

77
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,400
He may be able to get the job done for me.

78
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,030
Your honor.

79
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,170
He must have had unshakeable evidence for him to say a killer move

80
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,720
taught by Prince Kamehame was used for molestation.

81
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,550
I'd like for him to present that evidence.

82
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:49,490
I ask Prosecutor Haga to show us the evidence.

83
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,000
Go! Gin-san!

84
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,880
Prosecutor Haga, present the evidence.

85
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,970
Hm? What's wrong?

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,150
Don't tell me you came to this conclusion without any evidence?

87
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,250
So these are false accusations?

88
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,190
When we searched the defendant's room,

89
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,970
we found these.

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,490
I didn't want to bring out such offensive trash and violate the sanctity of the court, but...

91
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,480
Yikes...

He had about thirty of them.

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,920
Some were even about molestation.

102
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,460
I think you can now see the defendant's abnormal obsession with sex.

Counsel, I would like to hear your opinion about the evidence presented.

136
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,930
Why of course.

137
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,650
As a man, it's only natural to be interested in the opposite sex.

138
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,280
I think the defendant's collection is no more than what an average healthy male possesses.

139
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,440
On the contrary, I think it's abnormal to not own these kinds of videos.

Yes, but in general, I think thirty discs are too many.

152

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,040
There's a man looking in on a girl changing.

163
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,380
Does he look familiar?

164
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,180
That's against the rules!

165
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,970
Three weeks ago, the attorney, Mr. Sakata,

166
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,620
was questioned by police on charges of peeping into a girl's room while she was changing.

167
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,540
Due to a lack of evidence he was let go with a stern warning,

168
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,240
but can someone like that be qualified to defend the molestation charges of his client?

169
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,410
I still question that. How do you all feel, ladies and gentlemen of the court?

170
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,750
Go home, pervert attorney!

171
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,110
A pair of perverts! Throw both of them in the slammer!

172
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,580
Silence!

173
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,070
Silence in the court.

174
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,100
Prosecutor Haga! Do not incite the audience!

175
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,160
Haga! What an asshole!

176
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,060
Not only did he check up on me, but on Gin-san too?

177
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,060
So this is the power of a true professional prosecutor.

178
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,620
How can we win against this?

179
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,540
We don't have a chance in hell!

180
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:25,010
[Note: Yuki is a goat from the anime version of Heidi. Gintoki is dressed up as him.]

181
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:25,010
Joseph, Yuki-chan, come here.

182
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,640
Huh? What?

183
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,590
Heidi!!

184
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,890
Come here...

185
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,880
No, this isn't Heidi anymore.

186
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,000
Has she changed into something worse after being swallowed up by the abyss?

187
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,660
If that swallows us up, then we'll never find happiness.

188
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,600
Gin-san, do something.

189
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,130
O...Objection!

190
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,330
What happened to me has nothing to do with this case.

191
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,530
Besides, I was just resting in the park when that girl just happened to come into my view.

192
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,440
That misunderstanding has already been cleared up.

193
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,210
Objection! It has everything to do with this.

194
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,070
Do you think a pervert can defend another pervert?

195
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,660
What this shows is that the two of them were part of some sexually perverted community.

196
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,590
I'm telling you, I wasn't peeping!

197
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,280
Don't put me in the same category as this guy.

198
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,170
I'm gonna kill you!!

199
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,180
Your honor! Did you hear that?

200
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,710
The defense just admitted to the defendant's charges.

201
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,460
Damn.

202
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,360
What are you saying?

203
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,110
You're supposed to be defending me, right?

204
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,220
O-Objection! I made a mistake.

205
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,800
That was a slip of the tongue.

206
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,900
The truth slipped out...

207
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,030
Come on! So you really believe I committed a lewd act?!

208
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,680
Shut up! Now that it's down to this, all I can think about is saving myself.

209
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,470
The shuttle will now separate and take off on its own.

210
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,170
Don't give me that.

211
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm taking you down with me now!

212
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,490
The verdict is in.

213
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,930
Your honor, further examination would only be a waste of time.

214
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,470
I ask you to hand down a severe punishment to the defendant, Taizo Hasegawa.

215
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,780
Hm...

216
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,990
Just a minute!

217
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,680
If the defense's mistake determines my guilt,

218
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,990
then will the prosecutor's mistake determine my innocence?

219
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,340
If that's the case, then here it is.

220
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,100
Prosecutor Haga's secret!!

221
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,930
Prosecutor Haga and my wife...

222
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,590
He's in a relationship with my separated wife.

223
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,290
In hopes of getting together with my wife, he offered me an unlawful deal.

224
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,340
He said if I put my seal on the divorce papers, he'd let me win this trial.

225
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,080
Hasegawa-san...

226
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,590
It's okay...

227
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,510
If I can win by humiliating myself...

228
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,400
If I can save Hatsu by humiliating myself, then I'll do it.

229
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,930
Prosecutor Haga, is what the defendant just said true?

230
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,450
It's true.

231
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,800
But only up to the part where he said I have a relationship with his wife.

232
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,640
It's not true that I offered him an unlawful deal.

233
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,180
What the defendant is saying is completely fictitious.

234
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,970
What are you saying?

235
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,130
You told me...

236
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,550
Do you have proof?

237
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,960
Proof that an unlawful deal was made between you and me.

238
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,600
If you have that proof, let's see it right now.

239
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,770
Objection!

240
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
Even if he may not be able to prove that an unlawful deal existed between the two of you, this picture...

241
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,220
...should serve as proof that you tried to convict the defendant based on personal reasons.

242
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,090
But the same can be said for the defendant...

243
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,970
That picture can serve as evidence that the defendant acted on personal reasons.

244
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,430
It can be argued that he made up unfounded lies...

245
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,680
from a grudge held against the prosecutor for stealing his wife.

246
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,990
Not only that.

247
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,130
I found you!!

248
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,400
With his wife deserting him and his work not going well,

249
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,550
...the defendant was unable to find sexual... I mean, mental satisfaction...

250
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,340
And so he fulfilled himself by committing lewd sexual acts.

251
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,050
Doesn't this prove that?

252
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,280
Gin-san!

253
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,380
This picture is proof that he is a doggone loser.

254
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,540
Prosecutor Haga, watch what you say.

255
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,920
If I can't call him a doggone loser, then what do you want me to call him?

256
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,930
It's the perfect name for him.

257
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,260
I was trying to entrap him so I could make Hatsu-dono mine?

258
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,980
That's ridiculous!

259
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,100
Do you think Hatsu-dono is still in love with a doggone loser like him?

260
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Do you think I would actually go out of my way to entrap a doggone loser like him?

261
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,530
There's no need for that.

262
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,090
Because Hatsu-dono and I already love each other!

263
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,060
Your honor! There's no need to continue with the trial.

264
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,910
Hand down your sentence that befits this doggone loser.

265
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,650
Defense, Prosecution.

266
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,310
Do either of you have any objections?

267
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,010
O-Objection!

268
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,730
No objections.

269
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,050
Objection!

270
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,210
What's this?

271
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,180
Gin-san...

272
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,450
Clara!!

273
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,840
[Note: Gintoki is dressed up as Clara from the anime version of Heidi.]

274
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,840
Clara rises... No, flies!!

275
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,770
Prosecutor! You just said, "we love each other..."

276
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,290
And "there's no need to continue with the trial."

277
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,660
In other words, the only thing that proves your innocence is that thing you call love.

278
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,740
If that's the case, then let's see it.

279
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,560
Let's see this love of yours.

280
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,870
Your honor!

281
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,840
This is what Prosecutor Haga calls love.

282
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,220
We found that Prosecutor Haga is involved with many women

283
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,720
besides the defendant Taizo Hasegawa's wife.

284
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,390
And not only that, they're all wealthy.

285
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,460
Upon further investigation, Prosecutor Haga is...

286
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,050
Order the outsiders to leave.

287
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,450
Objection! I brought these people down as material witnesses!

288
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,450
Please let them take the stand.

289
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,440
I will allow it.

290
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,210
Huh? What's that? Love is your proof?

291
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,310
Looks like you're selling yourself cheap, Mr. Casanova.

292
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,810
Objection! Those girls are all my friends.

293
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,090
Nothing more than that.

294
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,210
The only one I have a serious relationship with is Hatsu-san.

295
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,540
Or are you saying that you can prove my relationship with those girls?

296
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,750
Okay, let's say that you are only in love with Hatsu-san.

297
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,270
But that's just one-sided.

298
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,570
According to your logic, if Hasegawa-san and Hatsu-san were still in love,

299
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,860
then that leaves room for you to make an unlawful deal so you can make Hatsu-san yours.

300
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,600
C-Can you even prove that?

301
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,460
Your honor, do you mind if I tell you a story from the past?

302
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,440
Go ahead.

303
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,290
Long ago, there was a very loving couple.

304
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,770
The husband was the son of a low-class samurai

305
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,960
and the wife was the daughter of a high-ranking bureaucrat.

306
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,400
Their marriage was opposed due to their class differences,

307
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,250
but when the husband agreed to take the wife's last name, they were married.

308
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:02,710
Because he married into a good family, the husband was given a high-ranking job.

309
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,440
But he didn't like it.

310
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,380
As a man, he felt he wanted to choose his own path and not be told what to do.

311
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,290
On top of that, his wife even bought him a suit so he would look decent.

312
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,840
This angered the husband and they had a huge fight.

313
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,270
He reported to work on his first day wearing his usual dirty kimono.

314
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,400
When the conservative higher-ups saw this, they got really upset.

315
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,760
So the husband had no choice, but to put his suit on

316
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,860
and go to his boss' house that night to apologize.

317
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:40,060
There was a woman who got there before him, kneeling on the ground with her forehead on the gravel.

318
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,500
A shabbily clothed woman apologizing with her head to the ground.

319
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,740
She said, in our house, this is our formal wear so please forgive my husband.

320
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,040
The woman cried as she begged for forgiveness.

321
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,940
His wife took off her usual pretty clothes and threw herself on the ground,

322
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,180
bowing to her husband's boss who was well beneath her social status.

323
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,180
The husband saw this and ripped apart the suit he was wearing.

324
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,930
And...

325
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,200
...along with his wife, cried and begged for forgiveness until the morning.

326
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,790
Ever since then, whenever the husband has an important event,

327
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,660
he always puts on that suit.

328
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,520
He always remembers his wife who shamelessly apologized for his sake.

329
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,910
And he vows to throw away his pride and work hard for the sake of his wife.

330
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,710
And that shabby old suit that has gone through

331
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,380
one too many alterations is now too short.

332
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,480
You bastard... How do you know that embarrassing story?

333
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,710
I was asked to give you this new suit since the one you have on is so unsightly.

334
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,560
But sorry! He didn't wear the new suit you got for him again.

335
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,290
He's such a stubborn guy.

336
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,950
No, they're just a stubborn couple.

337
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,300
You're perfect for each other with those shabby clothes.

338
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,460
Hatsu!

339
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,510
I will now give you your sentence.

340
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,000
The defendant, Taizo Hasegawa...

341
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,730
...is guilty.

342
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,990
You're guilty of causing your wife grief.

343
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,850
Go after her right now. That's your sentence.

344
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,780
Your honor!

345
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:32,640
As for Prosecutor Haga, I will hand down his punishment as soon as we get more details.

346
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,870
The DVD owned by the defendant will be considered hazardous,

347
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,250
and therefore will be left in my keeping.

348
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,810
Why? You really wanna watch them, don't you?

349
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,780
And with this, the case is closed.

350
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,440
Why didn't you say anything?

351
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,290
If you had brought up the fact that Hasegawa-san ran away after being ordered to commit suicide by harakiri,

352
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,190
we would've had no chance of winning.

353
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,490
I wanted to fight.

354
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,290
After all, a woman you truly love should be won over by real ability.

355
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,580
You...

356
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,090
This is the only way I knew how.

357
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,530
Although she never gave me the time of day,

358
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,410
she was a wonderful woman.

359
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,930
And...he has some great friends.

360
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,280
How I envy him...

361
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,610
Hatsu! Wait, wait for me.

362
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,360
We need to talk... Whoa!

363
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,060
[Won the Case]

364
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,120
We did it, Hasegawa-san.

365
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,630
Madao! We expect to get compensated!

366
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,190
Hatsu!

367
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:27,840
[Preview]

368
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,390
It suddenly appeared beneath our feet.

369
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,100
There was only one thing we knew.

370
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,980
That it was neither a living creature nor man-made.

371
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,840
It was despair itself.

372

["If You're A Man, Don't Give Up."]

373

[A planet is about to be destroyed by the erosion of a mysterious object.]

374
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,060
[The legendary savior "Umibozu" appears before those who are standing on the edge of despair.]
