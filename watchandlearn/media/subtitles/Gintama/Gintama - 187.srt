00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,680
Some things in this world aren't
meant to be known, little girl.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,940
Besides, you shouldn't go off talking
out of character like that.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,990
See? You've triggered my death flag.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,340
Kirie?!

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,080
Don't move.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,900
If you don't want to take the daughter's
life after taking the father's.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,850
Right, Mr. Sogo Okita, the murderer?

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,330
Kamiyama, listen to me.

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,680
Forget everything you just saw.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,510
Rokkaku was already dead
when we found him.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,030
He was caught up in the battle and
killed by the Anti-Foreigner Faction.

13
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,910
["It's Goodbye Once a Flag is Set"]

14
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,380
Liar...

15
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,990
You tricked me.

16
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,580
You said you would help
me avenge my father!

17
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,980
You promised to help me kill this man!

18
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,500
You were using me?!

19
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,210
Oh? Don't make me sound so bad.

20
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,070
Weren't you the one to break
our promise first?

21
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,010
You were supposed to approach the boy
and serve as bait to draw him out.

22
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,900
Yet, you moved on your own
and created a mess.

23
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,810
This boy is our prey.

24
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,430
You aren't allowed to act on your own.

25
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,390
Be grateful that we've used
you as a tool to kill the boy.

26
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,530
Revenge will still be yours.

27
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,240
Your dead father must be happy for you.

28
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,940
Honestly...

29
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,950
Such a foolish daughter,
just like her father.

30
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,960
Dying while manipulated by others.

31
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,170
That is the fate shared
by you and your father.

32
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,790
Manipulated...?

33
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,370
Father was...?

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,370
Do you know something about Father?!

35
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,870
What a pitiful child.

36
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,690
Shall I tell you?

37
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,630
How your attempt to avenge
your father is misguided?

38
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,400
How your father isn't worthy of being
avenged by his daughter?

39
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,100
What are...

40
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,290
What are you saying?

41
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,710
I don't understand.

42
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,470
You see...

43
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,050
Your father, Muneharu Rokkaku...

44
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,830
Are you a Rokkaku Inn staff member?

45
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,060
Get a hold of yourself!

46
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,980
Are you hurt?

47
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,990
Everything's fine now!

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,500
We've taken care of the Faction!

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,340
Can you stand?

50
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,580
This is...?

51
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,560
Kamiyama! You okay?!

52
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,030
The next thing I knew, the Rokkaku owner
was lying on the floor, covered in blood.

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,950
Captain Okita wasn't the one
who killed her father.

54
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,260
It was me!

55
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,990
The Rokkaku owner was a member
of the Sokai Faction.

56
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,030
I heard from the captain afterwards.

57
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,950
His wife and daughter were taken hostage and he
was forced to cooperate with the Sokai Faction.

58
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,620
Not only was he forced to offer
his inn as a hiding place,

59
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,740
his savings were also used
to help fund their activities.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,700
His wife and daughter never knew.

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,890
That's right.

62
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,550
The Rokkaku owner was fighting
all alone to keep his family safe.

63
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,980
Never telling anyone else so
they wouldn't have to suffer!

64
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,440
Even then, he was trying to protect
his family, his daughter!

65
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,570
Listen to me.

66
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:31,020
Don't tell anyone that he tried
to kill you, that you killed him.

67
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,210
No one will find out if we stay quiet.

68
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,040
But, Captain!

69
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,490
Hasn't he suffered enough?

70
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,690
He's drenched in blood.

71
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,390
There isn't any point in shaming
him any further.

72
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,180
Let him die a father.

73
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,440
The captain didn't do anything wrong!

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,190
It was all my fault!

75
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,160
Even after being forced
to shoulder the crime...

76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,130
After people have tried to kill him...

77
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,320
He's still protecting that secret!

78
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,020
Even after being called a murderer,

79
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,420
he's still hiding the fact that the father got his hands
dirty, lost his life for the sake of his daughter!

80
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,360
He's trying to protect what the Rokkaku
owner was protecting!

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,330
That idiot.

82
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,740
Please help the captain!

83
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,250
The girl isn't the only one
who's after the captain!

84
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,300
The girl is being used by remnants
of the Sokai Faction!

85
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,860
Sotatsu Tendo, the younger brother of the Sokai Faction
leader, Koutatsu Tendo, who died at Rokkaku Inn!

86
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,360
He intends to crush us for destroying
his brother and the Sokai Faction!

87
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,400
So the kid wasn't the only
one who wanted revenge.

88
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,310
We should let Kondo-san and
the others know immediately!

89
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,010
Before something terrible happens!

90
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,610
We can't!

91
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,360
He said he'd kill me if I told
anybody else in the force!

92
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,140
This isn't the time to be
worrying about that!

93
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,340
A call from Captain Okita!

94
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,820
You have him under super
sadistic bastard.

95
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,340
You were crying just a second ago, but you
have him under super sadistic bastard.

96
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,990
Why don't they kill you
and get it over with?

97
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,190
Beats me.

98
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,360
Maybe they plan on using me as bait to lure
in the Shinsengumi and fry all of us together.

99
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,800
Where's the kid?

100
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,870
The lady's asleep. Staying up
late is bad for your beauty.

101
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,350
She isn't asleep.

102
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,390
You're the one who knocked her out.

103
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,020
You see...

104
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,680
Your father, Rokkaku...

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,350
Would you normally knock someone out because
you didn't want her to hear something?

106
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,730
It seemed like you really wanted
to hide something.

107
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,710
You were the one who was saying
to tell the kid the truth.

108
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,160
Pretty abrupt change of heart.

109
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,170
[Note: A Japanese celebrity known
to frequently change her hair style.]

110
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,280
Like they say, Kaela Kimura's
hair and a woman's heart...

111
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,170
Two things that constantly change.

112
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,660
That would mean Kaela has it rough when
her hair and heart are changing all the time.

113
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,610
More or less.

114
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,550
Don't reply like you're Kaela.

115
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,630
Well, Kaela schamaela,
you have my thanks.

116
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,170
I don't need a weeping kid
next to me in this situation.

117
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm the one who wants to cry.

118
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,110
I've never seen you look so unsure.

119
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,990
Sadists can't take the heat.

120
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,900
I wish people would be more
considerate to me.

121
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,560
What have you done in your life to
make so many people hate you?

122
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,010
Even if you have a million lives,
isn't enough make up for it.

123
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,230
It's because I live by killing others.

124
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,130
No difference if a kid or two
starts hating me now.

125
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,620
Since I can't deny that I'm a killer.

126
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,210
You're one hell of a killer.

127
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,090
You've managed to piss off all of these people
yet you can't stand to watch a little girl cry?

128
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,330
A kid wouldn't understand.

129
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,250
Some things in this world must be protected,
even if it means getting your hands dirty.

130
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,500
Some things can only be seen
through a tainted eye.

131
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,530
Of all the things that have to
stay clean, no matter what...

132
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,530
Well, I'm not saying that it has anything
to do with a kid's tears.

133
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,930
Oh, and one more thing...

134
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,970
I want to ask you something.

135
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,600
Is it okay if I take a dump here?

136
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,830
Not good! Definitely not good!

137
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,600
I've got it bad! Real bad!

138
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,510
What, are you serious?!

139
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,210
Hold on!

140
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,770
You just said some things has to stay
clean, and this is what comes next?!

141
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,440
This is the part where
you CAN'T get dirty!

142
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,100
Impossible! It's impossible!

143
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,520
It's gonna come out!

144
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,310
Hey, lend me the covers on your head!

145
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,790
They'll do, so hand them over!

146
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,070
What are you going to do with them?!

147
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,570
It's not going to fit!

148
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,560
Help!

149
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,020
Excuse me, guards!

150
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,570
This guy wants to poop!

151
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,930
Could you let him go to the restroom?!

152
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,310
He's probably trying to escape.

153
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,090
Tell him to hold it in.

154
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,090
Don't give me that crap!

155
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,400
Do you know what will happen
if he poops here?!

156
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,670
Don't underestimate a sadist's poop!

157
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,550
I've seen one Gin-chan forgot to flush!

158
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,570
It was super huge!

159
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,620
It was super long!

160
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,170
You could spell the letter "S" with it!

161
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,130
S-Sis, wait up.

162
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,520
Take me with you.

163
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,760
Huh? Why is there a river?

164
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,370
Oh, it's a washlet.

165
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,770
He's seeing things now!

166
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,550
He's trying to cross the washlet Styx!

167
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,890
Hey, get a grip!

168
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,970
Hey! Don't get the place dirty!

169
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,350
Don't we have a bedpan or something?!

170
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,070
B-Bedpan? I'll go look!

171
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,240
Oh, it's okay now.

172
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,710
What?

173
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,960
It's okay?

174
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,070
Huh?

175
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,750
Could you have... Uh?

176
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,010
Let it out?

177
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,040
No, I didn't.

178
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,630
Wait, h-hold on.

179
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,830
Uh? But you have this enlightened
look on your face.

180
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,620
You're looking far into the distance!

181
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,620
I didn't let it out. Please give me a break.

182
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,190
He's sitting funny now!

183
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,810
He's trying to keep his ass from touching!

184
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,790
No! How filthy!

185
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,340
Clean!

186
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,970
Clean it up immediately!

187
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,020
I'm starting to feel sick...

188
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,690
Gonna hurl...

189
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,500
Nooo!

190
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,560
Now the kid who's feeling sick
from the poop is gonna hurl!

191
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,510
Hello! Do something about that kid!

192
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,500
Bring a Kitaro barf bag quick!

193
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,500
[Note: From "GeGeGe no Kitaro". "Gegege" is the
Japanese onomatopoeia when vomiting.]

194
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,740
How much did that kid eat?!

195
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,390
It's like a waterfall of barf!

196
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,800
Ew! Do something!

197
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,700
Hurry! Do something quick!

198
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,790
Filthy...

199
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,690
Lord Sotatsu!

200
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,370
Here's a Kitaro barf bag...

201
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,310
Is this what you meant when you said
some things must be protected,

202
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,000
even if you have to get your hands dirty?

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,040
Are you an idiot?

204
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,060
My anal sphincters aren't
weak like Kondo-san's.

205
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,240
Like I'm going to poop
my pants at this age.

206
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,060
They escaped!

207
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,430
After them! After them!

208
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,860
Don't let them get away...

209
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,500
Can't get anywhere when
we keep slipping...

210
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,280
Damn it! Don't let them get away!

211
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,800
What do we do?! What should we do?!

212
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,970
I have to come alone!

213
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,730
They said if I call for help,
Captain Okita's a dead man!

214
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,560
They intend to kill everyone who was
involved in the Rokkaku incident!

215
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,170
Oh really?

216
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,730
Let's go, Shinpachi.

217
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,400
Yes.

218
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,350
Hold on!

219
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,950
Didn't you hear me?!

220
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,440
If I bring any help, the captain...!

221
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,620
You don't need to worry.

222
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,540
We aren't on your side.

223
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,540
You aren't on our side?

224
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,690
Then why are you going?

225
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,200
Because we're the same as him.

226
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,740
Samurai, that's why.

227
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,010
Don't let them get away!

228
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,190
After them!

229
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,440
The kid sure hooked up
with an annoying bunch.

230
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,860
There's no end to this.

231
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,460
This is bad!

232
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,410
The three of us won't be
able to escape together!

233
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,720
At this rate, we'll be wiped out!

234
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,650
We have no choice!

235
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,210
Leave it to us!

236
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,610
While we run away, you
deal with the enemies!

237
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,850
What do you mean, we have no choice?

238
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,800
You're making me do all the work.

239
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,010
A couple of little girls will
only hold you back!

240
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,800
Get going!

241
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,610
To be a decoy!

242
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,350
You call yourself a little girl when
it suits your purposes!

243
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,460
What are you doing?

244
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,280
My leg! It won't move!

245
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,260
A rifle?

246
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,170
Those bastards are even armed with...?!

247
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,340
Stupid girl!

248
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,300
This way, hurry!

249
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Stop taking your time!

250
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,610
I want to take my time! Damn sadist!

251
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,400
Look over there!

252
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,160
Yes, sir!

253
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,750
I'm beat.

254
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,030
This is why I hate kids.

255
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,790
I refuse to be a burden on you.

256
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,280
Take Kirie and run.

257
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,760
I refuse to be in your debt.

258
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:58,190
Besides, there'd be no point if the
kid stabbed me from behind.

259
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,040
They're after me.

260
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,460
Once I show myself, run
in the opposite direction.

261
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,730
You should be able to
make do with one leg.

262
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,680
Listen up.

263
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,740
Don't talk to anyone about this business.

264
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,820
You intend to settle this alone?

265
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,820
I fabricated evidence in this case.

266
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,910
If Hijikata finds out, I'll be fired.

267
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,900
Is that really what you're trying to hide?

268
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:38,560
Aren't you trying to silence them all so Kirie
doesn't hear about what her pappy did?

269
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,770
That's not it.

270
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,410
Do you really think that's
the right decision?

271
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,950
I don't know what kind of bad
stuff Kirie's pappy did.

272
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,560
I don't know why he died.

273
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,360
But do you really believe that
shouldering the sin

274
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,380
and covering up what he did is
best for Kirie, best for you?

275
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,490
Like I said.

276
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,880
Some things can only be seen
through a tainted eye.

277
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:21,500
Her old man died with dirty hands for the
sake of his family, to protect his daughter.

278
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,940
Now the daughter is getting her hands
dirty for the sake of her old man.

279
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,080
Isn't that stupid?

280
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,140
As long as she considers me the target
of her revenge, she'll stay clean.

281
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,560
Since I'm invincible.

282
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,600
Revenge won't make anybody happy.

283
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,380
Especially not her old man.

284
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,830
That should be our job.

285
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,290
It's our duty

286
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,360
to get our hands dirty.

287
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,730
You...

288
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,960
Look.

289
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,620
The enemy's found us because
you took too long.

290
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,810
It's the same as two years ago.

291
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,570
You fighting alone to protect
your comrades.

292
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,660
While we have you surrounded.

293
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,600
The only difference is in the numbers.

294
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,840
Which means, boy...

295
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,780
You're the one who will lose this time.

296
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,920
Lose?

297
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,860
That'd be the same result as last time.

298
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,900
When you fight, it doesn't matter
how many enemies you kill.

299
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,230
If you fail to protect what you're
supposed to protect, you lose.

300
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,330
We lost that battle two years ago.

301
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,920
We weren't able to protect
what we needed to.

302
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
I refuse to let that happen again.

303
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,190
I refuse to lose again.

304
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,960
This time, I'll protect what I need to.

305
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,050
No matter what happens.

306
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,090
I won't let a single person

307
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,360
get past me!

308
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,110
D-Don't insult us!

309
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,810
What can you possibly do by yourself?!

310
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,420
D-Don't fall back!

311
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,900
Everybody rush him at once!

312
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,650
Hurry up and run!

313
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,500
Th-That's right!

314
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,100
Snipe him from afar!

315
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,330
Fire!

316
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,360
I said that it's useless.

317
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,030
Can't you understand?

318
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,750
I'm not budging one step,
not even if I die.

319
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,960
That guy's an idiot.

320
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,770
He still made a girl cry in the end.

321
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,440
Were you holding it in the whole time?

322
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,980
Were you pretending that
you weren't awake?

323
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,500
You probably wanted to stay
and stop that stupid fight.

324
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,330
You probably wanted to apologize.

325
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,510
You probably wanted to thank him.

326
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,720
But you pretended you didn't
hear a thing for his sake?

327
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,840
You didn't have a choice but to leave without
a word, out of respect for his feelings?

328
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,360
You don't need to cry.

329
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,300
There's no need to thank
or apologize to that idiot.

330
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,550
That isn't why he's standing firm.

331
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,670
Just try to kill him the next
time you see him around.

332
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,700
The idiot will be happier that way.

333
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,390
You don't need to worry.

334
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,230
He won't die until you've
gotten your revenge.

335
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,240
This is looking a little bad.

336
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,120
I keep swinging away but their
numbers won't go down.

337
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,050
Hell, it looks like there's
more of them now.

338
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,700
My vision is starting to fail me...

339
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,210
I see that you've finally given up.

340
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,870
Now! This is our chance!

341
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,360
Everybody attack him!

342
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,040
Because that idiot has...

343
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,890
Plenty of more idiots around him.

344
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,230
Sorry. Sounds like a pain, so I refuse.

345
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,030
Captain! Are you okay?!

346
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,930
Who are you?

347
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,820
Who are we supposed to cut down next?

348
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,780
The idiot who violated bureau policy?

349
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,360
A written apology won't be
enough this time, Sogo.

350
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,810
Sh-Shinsengumi!

351
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,210
Why are you here?!

352
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,410
What are you doing?!

353
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,300
Hurry and dispose of them...

354
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,430
Sorry, we already disposed of them all.

355
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,540
Why?! Why did this happen?!

356
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,890
Seriously...

357
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,950
Why did this happen?

358
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,710
Who was the

359
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,100
snitch?!

360
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,600
There are these things known
as death flags in our world.

361
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,240
A spoken line which foreshadows death.

362
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,230
A bad guy who suddenly
becomes a good guy.

363
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,460
Well, in any case, it means that you shouldn't
do anything out of character.

364
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,270
Even if you manage to survive the flag,

365
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,070
you'll end up suffering as
much as if you had died.

366
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,060
Captain, how many more do you have?

367
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,530
I'm gonna die...

368
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,310
That's right, Captain.

369
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,950
Did you ever run into the Rokkaku
owner's daughter again?

370
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,080
No, haven't seen her.

371
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,770
What?! Doesn't that mean she still
thinks you killed her father?!

372
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,020
She might come after you again!

373
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,870
I heard that she was taken in by
some relatives in the country.

374
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,530
We probably won't ever see her again.

375
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,870
Man, that kid was one
hell of a troublemaker.

376
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,540
I hope she's able to lead a happy life.

377
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,750
So happy that she forgets
about the captain.

378
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,480
But you tend to leave
a lasting impression.

379
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,260
You're one to talk.

380
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,330
But it's possible that these flags
don't always bring misfortune.

381
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,500
Sometimes, it isn't so
bad to trigger a flag.

382
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,890
You may find yourself feeling
that way on rare occasions.

383
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,080
Huh? What did it bring?

384
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,150
Hey, old man.

385
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,840
Give me this, this, and this.

386
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,620
Gotcha.

387
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,080
And top it off with tabasco sauce.

388
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,420
Gotcha.

389
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,950
That's something for you to find
out when you trigger a flag.

390

00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,830
One boiling hot summer morning...

392
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,040
A middle-aged man who's
lost everything...

393
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,220
A boy who's been emotionally scarred...

394
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,910
That was the day they met.
