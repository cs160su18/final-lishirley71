2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,410
Oi, stop daydreaming!

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,220
Don't compare me to these country bumpkins.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,700
I was born and raised a city girl.

5
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,740
You got me.

6
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,120
I thought you might be, but...

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,910
that umbrella, that skin.

8
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,610
Just when I thought I had stopped the war with the old man, I get this.

9
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,560
Give me a break.

10
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,450
I don't like killing my own kind.

11
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,120
Maybe this is also the destiny of those with Yato blood,

12
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
to continue fighting until you die.

13
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,390
The cursed clan.

14
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,890
Gin-chan, leave this to me.

15
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,870
You can go.

16
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,850
Are you stupid? He'll be tough even with three people.

17
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,670
Please go, Gin-san.

18
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,670
I... will protect Kagura-chan.

19
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,670
What are you talking about?

20
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,290
You'll just get in the way.  Just go!

21
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,020
You're in the way, Gin-san. Get out of here.

22
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,780
I'm talking about you!

23
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,880
Jeez.

24
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,610
You two. You know where to meet up, right?

25
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,180
Oi.

26
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,940
Next time we meet...

27
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,060
it'll be under the Sun.

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,450
Sounds good.

29
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,130
Life is...

30
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,620
said to be made of a string of important decisions.

31
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,990
This is the first time I've seen someone clearly pull the Joker.

32
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,640
That guy loses.

33
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Up against the Night King by himself,

34
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,710
there won't be a single trace of him left in this world.

35
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,630
You two win.

36
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,340
You're saved...

37
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,180
I'll turn you both into mince meat.

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,280
The loser is you.

39
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,070
We're going to turn you into Arabiki wieners!

40
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,440
Do it!

41
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,100
Why don't you fight back?

42
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,710
Why do you just stand there taking it?

43
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,550
I don't have the right to kill you.

44
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,960
Until now...

45
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,460
to protect Yoshiwara...

46
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,170
together, we judged those who broke the laws.

47
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,770
At times, women who tried to escape from Yoshiwara.

48
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,970
At times, women who were no longer able to attract customers.

49
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,250
I have piled up those burdens.

50
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,510
I can't just abandon these laws and continue to live on peacefully.

51
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,570
Kill me.

52
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,720
But I will buy some time.

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,360
You would turn your back on your own and protect the intruders?!

54
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,620
There is no worth in protecting this town.

55
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,040
While believing so,

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
I became Housen's puppet.

57
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,360
I protected Yoshiwara and its laws.

58
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,950
I couldn't change anything.

59
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,270
I gave up, believing nothing would change.

60
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,070
By protecting the town she was in, I was protecting Hinowa herself.

61
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,050
Believing that,

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,920
I've been wielding my sword.

63
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,560
I was not... protecting anything.

64
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,260
What I was protecting...

65
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,900
was neither Hinowa nor this town.

66
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,460
It was my own cage.

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,800
A cage was placed around Yoshiwara by none other than ourselves.

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,380
Fearing Housen and unable to change a thing, we silently watched.

69
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,060
We placed a cage around our hearts.

70
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,900
Trapped in a cage because of our own beauty,

71
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,070
we desperately tried to protect that cage.

72
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,340
To protect Yoshiwara, to protect Hinowa.

73
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,100
They were all excuses.

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,250
In order to hide my cowardice, I used Hinowa.

75
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,530
Nothing has changed.

76
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,200
True enslavement...

77
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,040
is when you place a cage around your own heart.

78
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,100
I haven't changed at all since then.

79
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,350
If you have the energy to whine about dying or whatnot,

80
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,520
then fight from within your cage...

81
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:09,920
against yourself.

82
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,250
Hinowa,

83
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,010
I won't run anymore.

84
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,430
I'll fight to break the cage.

85
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,100
Stand up straight,

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,930
watch the heavens,

87
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,170
and continue to live your life.

88
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,240
Until the very end,

89
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,360
facing the Sun,

90
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,610
I will stand tall.

91
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,810
Do it!

92
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,300
I can't do it anymore.

93
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,470
I don't want to!

94
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,270
Boss,

95
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,350
you aren't a coward.

96
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,760
You weren't protecting nothing.

97
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,960
You were protecting something,

98
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,470
us.

99
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,640
The women who tried to escape from Yoshiwara...

100
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,190
The women who no longer attracted customers...

101
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,710
The one making it look like those who broke the laws were taken care of,

102
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,330
and sheltered us inside the Hyakka...

103
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,200
was none other than you!

104
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,300
I...

105
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,380
stole the path of a woman from you.

106
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,720
I've killed the woman in you.

107
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,910
By the time we were sold here, we have already forgotten how to be women.

108
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,870
Instead of remaining mere objects,

109
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,580
you made the path for us to live as human beings.

110
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,180
The ones that are here now,

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,990
are the ones that you have been protecting.

112
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,210
Boss,

113
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,340
the Sun is not the only thing shining in the sky.

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,190
The Sun and the Moon...

115
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,740
are both irreplaceable lights that illuminate this town of darkness!

116
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,520
Boss?!

117
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,580
The Sun and the Moon...

118
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,330
I thought I was by your side protecting you this entire time,

119
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,780
yet you were so far away...

120
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,250
Now, for the first time,

121
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,800
I feel like I was able to stand beside you.

122
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,280
The way has been lit.

123
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,900
Yoshiwara...

124
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,750
Hinowa and Seita...

125
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,050
I leave them to you.

126
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,530
What's wrong?

127
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,920
The Arabiki wieners aren't ready yet?

128
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,590
I'm no match for him!

129
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,390
Even Kagura-chan is being brushed aside.

130
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,380
Even though they're both Yato, for there to be such a gap in ability...

131
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,400
We don't act on obligation or money.

132
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,230
A Yato only acts...

133
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,150
when there's a battlefield that drips with the stench of blood.

134
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,010
...Is how it was long ago,

135
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,130
but not anymore.

136
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,990
I'm just here on business,

137
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,960
but it doesn't seem like that's your case.

138
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,420
Could it be to save that little kid?

139
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,570
Where is he?

140
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,540
I'm asking you where my stupid brother, Kamui, is!

141
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,260
Brother? It couldn't be...

142
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,420
Stop!

143
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,340
We finally found him. Surround him quickly!

144
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,130
Just... just a little furth-

145
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,350
What're you doing in a place like this?

146
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,130
Are you possibly looking for your mother?

147
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,900
Huh? What's wrong?

148
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,820
Are you cold?

149
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,860
Are you okay?

150
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,900
Hey. If you want to meet her that badly, come with me.

151
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,770
I'll let you meet her.

152
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,180
With Hinowa.

153
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,360
A-Are you messing with me?

154
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,340
You aren't on our side.

155
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,170
You're not on Housen's side either.

156
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,870
Who are you?

157
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,430
Unfortunately, I have interest in neither Yoshiwara nor business.

158
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,110
I want to meet her...

159
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,640
The woman who turned Night King Housen into a coward.

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,220
I want to meet her...

161
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,530
The woman whom all the women of Yoshiwara depend on as their "Sun".

162
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,160
Oh dear. It seems like she wasn't one of them.

163
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,840
Now, shall we go see her?

164
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,820
The most beautiful... most powerful woman in all of Yoshiwara.

165
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,830
I see.

166
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,440
You... now that I think about it... you look like the commander...

167
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,280
What to do.

168
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,610
Just when I thought I had coincidentally met a fellow clansman on this remote planet,

169
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,580
she's an enemy.  And to top it off, a comrade's relative.

170
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,610
This goes beyond killing your own kind.

171
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,090
There's no need for concern.

172
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,610
He doesn't think anything of me anyway.

173
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,240
Forget fellow clansmen, even family.

174
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,670
He's a heartless bastard who even fought his own father and younger sister.

175
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,530
You can add subordinate and master to that list.

176
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,950
It seems we're all in the same boat.

177
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,950
Victims who have been pushed around by that idiot.

178
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,170
Siblings or subordinates don't matter, huh?

179
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,690
When the older one is nonchalant, the younger one needs to pick up his slack.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,260
Move aside.

181
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,640
Stopping the idiotic actions of the older sibling is the duty of the younger one.

182
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,960
Sorry.

183
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,400
Wiping the butts of the higher ups is the duty of the subordinate.

184
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,360
K-Kagura-chan...

185
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,570
Take this!

186
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,160
Kagura-chan!

187
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,640
T-This is... a fight between Yato...!

188
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:04,340
To think that a kid who's never been on a proper battlefield would come after me.

189
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,250
At least your instincts are from your father...

190
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,620
No, they're closer to your brother's.

191
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,650
Don't compare me to him.

192
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,150
I won't belittle you.

193
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,310
I recommend you leave.

194
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,040
If you hang around these lame guys too long,

195
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,470
your first-class potential will be ruined.

196
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,550
Or should I get in between and mediate your sibling quarrel?

197
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,250
I'm telling you not to compare me to you guys.

198
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,010
You guys are swept away by the blood of the Yato and scour the battlefields.

199
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,060
I choose my own battlefields.

200
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,840
Not through my blood,

201
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,740
but with my heart.

202
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,530
I stand on the battlefield to protect what I want.

203
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,340
If you're going to get in my way,

204
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,970
it doesn't matter whether you're my clansmen, my brother, or whoever else...

205
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,310
I'll crush you!

206
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,720
An older brother who fights as his blood commands,

207
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,540
and a younger sister who fights as her heart commands.

208
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:17,610
No, it's more like an older brother who follows his blood and a younger sister who fights against it.

209
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,450
It seems an understanding was impossible from the start.

210
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,060
However...

211
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:30,220
Unfortunately, no matter how much you try, you won't beat your stupid brother like that.

212
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,480
And now, a question for you.

213
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,880
A fist that defeats and a fist that kills...

214
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,440
Which one is heavier?

215
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,490
The answer is...

216
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,790
a kick that kills!

217
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,980
Destructive power is stronger than brute strength by far.

218
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,290
What? A trick question?

219
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,900
Don't be so stiff.

220
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,500
It was just a quiz.

221
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,620
Didn't you notice?

222
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,960
Subconsciously, you pulled back on your punch.

223
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,970
Trying to suppress your Yato instincts,

224
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,060
your punch dies before it even reaches me.

225
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,850
You don't want to hurt people.

226
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,320
You don't want to kill people.

227
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,770
It's quite the commendable way of thinking.

228
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,780
On this tepid Earth, that is.

229
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,780
However,

230
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,810
that kind of thinking doesn't work on the battlefield.

231
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,980
On the battlefield,

232
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,780
those who hesitate are the first to die.

233
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,060
You, who rejects your blood, and we, who take pride in it,

234
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,670
weren't even a match from the outset.

235
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,980
Kagura-chan...

236
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,180
Let go of Kagura-chan!

237
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,080
That was a good one just now, boy.

238
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,850
You fully intended to kill me.

239
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,350
However,

240
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,720
too bad.

241
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,710
That one's not there anymore.

242
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,970
Shinpachi!

243
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,470
Now, another choice.

244
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,560
Which one of you wants to die first?

245
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,830
Choose!

246
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,040
Stop it!

247
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,530
Let go of Shinpachi!

248
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,580
That's not one of the choices.

249
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,780
I told you,

250
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,520
life is a string of important decisions.

251
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,610
Make sure to pick the best option so you don't regret it.

252
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,060
You...

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,470
You...

254
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,760
Die!

255
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,010
Don't be so stiff!

256
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,150
It's just a quiz, right?!

257
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,710
I guess it's decided.

258
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,460
Stop it!

259
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,480
Stop it!

260
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,900
Stop it!!

261
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,240
Stop it!

262
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,960
Stop it!

263
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,380
Stop it!!

264
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,870
Her movements suddenly...

265
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,650
What happened to that kid?

266
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,660
K-Kagura... -chan?

267
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,710
So the chains have broken, eh?

268
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,270
The chains that subconsciously suppressed her Yato powers,

269
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,630
because of her fear of hurting others...

270
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,590
In response to her friend's peril...

271
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,720
it disappeared along with her sanity.

272
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,340
You've finally awakened.

273
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,350
You beast!

274
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,150
Kagura-chan!

275
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,790
I've been waiting for you to appear!

276
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,580
I've been thinking that having just one arm wasn't enough of a handicap!

277
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,980
Has your intelligence gone with your sanity?

278
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,960
If you lose both hands, you won't be able to attack or defend!

279
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,390
In the end, even if a beast is a beast,

280
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,800
are you a little bunny?

281
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,020
Oi, oi. You have to be kidding me.

282
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,670
I was pretty serious with that last one.

283
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,340
You're going to hurt this old man's feelings.

284
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,680
She's overpowering him!

285
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,220
An experienced Yato... Kagura-chan is...

286
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,680
Is that...

287
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,940
Kagura-chan? Is that...

288
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,650
Is that...

289
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,560
our Kagura-chan?

290
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,980
You got me...

291
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,460
It seems that the chains I took off weren't connected to a beast,

292
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,620
this is a monster.

293
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,380
Even though I lectured you that the ones who hesitate die first on the battlefield,

294
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,460
it seems I was the one who was hesitating.

295
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,080
When I look at you...

296
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't help but see your brother's face.

297
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,150
Kill me,

298
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,230
as your instincts command you to.

299
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,720
No matter how much you struggle against your blood, you're no different from your brother.

300
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,140
In the end, you're the same as your brother.

301
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,410
Obey your blood and kill me.

302
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,560
Embrace the Yato and kill me.

303
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,940
The battlefield is the only place we belong.

304
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,080
It's what you have to do to survive on the battlefield.

305
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,890
That is the duty of beasts that fight until they die,

306
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,020
a Yato's duty!

307
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,430
What do you think you're doing?

308
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,650
I'm not doing this for you.

309
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,610
I made a promise... with Gin-san!

310
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,690
That I would protect Kagura-chan!

311
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,980
I'll... Kagura-chan...!

312
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,790
I'll protect the Kagura-chan we trust!

313
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,170
Not the Yato,

314
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,000
nor the sister of the crazy brother!

315
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,460
The blunt...

316
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,110
cocky...

317
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,020
gluttonous...

318
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,240
but very kind girl!

319
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,600
I'll... protect our precious friend!

320
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,810
I won't let Kagura-chan dirty her hands on the likes of you!

321
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,510
Open your eyes, Kagura-chan!

322
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,840
Your enemy...

323
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,280
The one we have to fight isn't this grimy bastard!

324
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,910
Kagura-chan!

325
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,000
What a completely naive bunch.

326
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,740
I've told you.

327
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,000
On the battlefield, the ones who hesitate to kill...

328
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,760
are the first to die.

329
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,770
Now then, here's another choice.

330
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,990
To be killed by Housen without being able to kill him...

331
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,880
or to be killed while trying to kill Housen...

332
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,160
Now then, which do you choose?

333
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,900
What? Both end in being killed?

334
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,540
Don't be so stiff.

335
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,370
It's just a quiz.

336
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,350
Life is made of a string of important decisions.

337
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,880
You should see how far your naive choices take you.

338
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:39,800
You!

339
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,880
I told you...

340
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,890
I...

341
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,280
don't like killing my own kind.

342
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,110
In this world, there's no such thing as a never ending night.

343
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,240
The time has come for the morning sun to rise on this town.

344
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,570
With the sunrise, the Night King should...

345
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,320
go to sleep!
