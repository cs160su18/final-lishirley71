What's going on? Is that guy more important than me?

172
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,420
That's adultery. Adultery!

173
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,170
Adultery? But weren't you two divorced a long time ago?

174

Don't be disrespectful! We've just been separated.

175

I don't remember putting my seal on any divorce papers.

176
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,840
You want me to investigate an extramarital affair?

177
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm really not interested since I know you and all.

178
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,730
I'll pay you well.

You're working for some loser ol' man that you hit it off with at some bar, right?

You sure he's reliable?

Don't be rude.

True, it may not be a top-notch firm,

185
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,540
but it's rare these days to find a company that lets me wear sunglasses to work.

186
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:03,390
You sure all their workers don't wear sunglasses and sell white powder?

187
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,060
How did you know? They also sell something called "chaka."

188

Don't worry about it.

192
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,370
Anyone who wears sunglasses can't be bad. They're just shy.

193

Shy guys don't wear such embarrassingly short pants.

194

Shut up. Hatsu bought me this suit when I first got a job.

Humph. If you keep thinking about your woman,

196
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,440
you'll fail at your new job again and screw up any chance of getting back together with her.

197
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,420
Leave that part of your life to me and you just focus on not getting fired, okay?

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,670
Thank you for always taking care of Taizo Hasegawa.

327
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,820
I'm Taizo's wife...Hatsu...

328
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,030
Why...

329
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,850
Why am I always like this?

330
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,310
Whenever I try to grab happiness, it runs away...

331
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,850
...at full speed.

332
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,570
That's right...

333
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,130
[Note: Refers to the TV animation version of Heidi.]

334
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,130
It's Heidi. Heidi lives inside of me.

335
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,340
The flowers of happiness are about to bloom,

336
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,390
but an impatient Heidi picks them,

337
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,600
even though they're only buds.

338
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,960
[Note: He looks like Peter from the TV animation version of Heidi.]

339
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,960
Heidi! It's too early. They haven't blossomed yet.

340
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,570
I tried to stop Heidi many times. But she would never listen to

341
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,380
what Peter says.

342
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,470
The only way to put an end to her acts of violence

343
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,900
was to throw myself and her into the ravine of the Alps.

344
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,800
Peter! No! I don't want to leave the mountains!

345
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,240
You must die!

346
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,690
That's all I've been thinking about the last few days.

347
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,020
You've got a visitor.

348
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,110
So, did you bring me a rope?

349
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,970
He offered me a deal. That bastard prosecutor who's going out with Hatsu.

350
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,580
[Note: In Japan, an official seal, used like a signature, is stamped on divorce papers.]

351
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,630
He told me to put my seal on the divorce papers.

352
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,580
If I don't, he will make sure my head gets cut off at the trial.

353
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,710
I'm planning on putting my seal on it.

354
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,130
All I'm doing is dragging Hatsu down by not being able to let go

355
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,640
and hanging on to this one piece of paper.

356
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,250
I don't want to stand in Hatsu's way

357
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,770
if she's trying to leave her hopeless husband and start a new life.

358
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,980
Besides, I don't wanna die.

359
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,990
Go ahead and laugh.

360
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,540
I'm gonna sell off my wife so I can save my precious life.

361
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,030
I...

362
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,090
Your wife came to see me.

363
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,880
She couldn't get in touch with you so she came to see me.

364
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,010
She wanted to wish you good luck on your new job.

365
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,010
And she asked me to give you this.

366
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,050
Th-This is...

367
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,520
She doesn't know...that I've been arrested?

368
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,630
I don't know. But I haven't told her anything.

369
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,940
Well, that's all I wanted to say. See ya.

370
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,150
Oh yeah, and about that rope.

371
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,480
I'll bring it next time I come.

372
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,970
I have no intention of getting you a rope so you can hang yourself.

373
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,660
But...

374
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,250
If it's a rope to pull you out of hell, then I'll bring you as many as you want.

375
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,190
Just remember that.

376
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,210
Peter!

377
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,240
Peter, you want me to stamp it?

378
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,250
I know you can't do it. I'll do it for you.

379
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,750
You don't wanna die, right?

380
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,420
Heidi!

381
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,880
Yeah, just like that, you keep living your life as a doggone loser.

382
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,350
Stop, Heidi!

383
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,220
That's perfect for you.

384
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,340
Joseph!!

385
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:48,500
[Note: Hasegawa is dressed up as Joseph from the TV animation version of Heidi.]

386
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,500
You're right. I may be a doggone loser...

387
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,790
But!

388
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,570
Even if I'm a worthless mutt...

389
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:05,050
[From the story "A Dog of Flanders"; a novel and anime about the boy Nello and his dog Patrasche. Nello and Patrasche freeze to death as they go to see Rubens' painting.]

390
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,170
I'm the mutt who goes to see Rubens' painting before I die!!

391
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,050
Just remember, I'll keep coming back!

392
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,460
I gotta fight.

393
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,910
It's all over if a man loses his fangs.

394
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,350
Even if I'm just a good-for-nothing mutt,

395
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,620
as long as I've got fangs, I'll keep fighting till the end.

396
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,300
I'll be a dandy man who won't be defeated...

397
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,300
[Note: A MAkenai DAndy na Otoko or a Madao.]

398
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,430
a Madao!

399
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,850
We will now start the trial for the Oedo Line Kinniku Buster molestation case.

400
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,570
The defendant, Taizo Hasegawa, please raise your head.

401
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,470
You must swear on this document

402
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,470
that any testimony you give here is true.

403
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,210
If you break this promise,

404
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,520
you will be subject to punishment regardless of the outcome of this trial.

405
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,800
Haga, if you want to cut my head off, then go right ahead.

406
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,880
But, I refuse to hand over Hatsu to a man who uses dirty tricks like you.

407
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,850
Even if my head gets chopped off, I'll bite your throat with just my head.

408
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,420
Hatsu...I will protect Hatsu!

409
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,800
Hang on a second.

410
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,350
Who is representing the defendant? Where is he?

411
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,320
Well...he's not here yet.

412
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,920
Perhaps something happened on his way here.

413
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,070
Oh, sorry. I'm late.

414
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,320
Attorney Shimoyama, who was supposed to be here, was arrested on molestation charges,

415
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,170
so I'm his replacement.

416
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,260
I'm the attorney, Sakata.

417
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,990
Nice to meet you.

418
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,790
Gin-san?!

419
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,500
Here? Do I sit here?

420
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,980
Take your shoes off. Your shoes.

421
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,920
Why...?

422
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,760
So you're gonna help me fight?

423
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,010
You and me together?

424
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,300
But can an amateur defend me?

425
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,320
So shall we start, Mr. Prosecutor?

426
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,760
We're up against that Prosecutor Haga, you know.

427
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,870
We will now start the trial.

428
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,050
[To be continued]

429
00:23:50,010 --> 00:24:26,440
[Preview]

430
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,900
At 7:25 on February 21st, the defendant Taizo Hasegawa,

431
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,830
forcefully grabbed the hand of the victim, Ms. A,

432
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,910
on the platform at Kabukicho station and dragged her down into the railway.

433
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,080
He is suspected of performing a Kinniku Buster in front of everyone.

434
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,150
This is clearly an act of molestation and assault.

435
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,000
And depending on the circumstance, it may even be considered attempted murder.

436
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,930
Objection!

437
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,110
It's true that the defendant performed a Kinniku Buster on the victim.

438
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,610
However it is questionable as to whether he did this with the intent to molest.

439
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,010
And therefore, I plead that the defendant is not guilty.

440
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,050
["Men, Be A Madao"]

441
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:36,720
[Attorney Sakata vs. Prosecutor Haga. The battle has begun.]

442
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,990
[And will Hasegawa be able to win against the Heidi living inside him?]
