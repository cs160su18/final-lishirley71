The land of the samurai. There was a time, long ago, when our country was called by that name.

65

With the arrival of the "Amanto" from outer space and the Sword Ban twenty years ago,

66
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,710
the samurai class fell into decline.

In such hard times, there was one man left with the spirit of the samurai. His name is Gintoki Sakata.

Speaking of the Amanto device, which we obtained with Mr. Kariya's support...

104

We just finished assembling it at our secret factory. All we need to do is get it into position.

If this project succeeds, all of Edo will fall under my control.

I'm too old to be reading JUMP. But I just bought it.

That's right, Gin.

No...

162
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,870
Shinpachi, what are you doing? "Lady's Four" is about to start!

163
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,720
I heard this is Odd Jobs Gin.

164
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,160
...frigging...

165
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,290
What's wrong? Can't get rid of this guy?

166
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,710
He's not trying to strongarm you, is he?

167
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,290
This is Odd Jobs, right?

168
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,830
...way!

169
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,890
No...

170
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,200
...frigging...

171
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,440
...way!

172
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,750
Hello? Hello? Hey, all three of you.

173
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,300
You can't be...

174
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,230
Are you a client?!

175
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,930
Ken Kato. Ronin. This episode's client.

176
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,950
Let me introduce myself. My name is Ken Kato. I've been a ronin for a few days now.

177
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,350
Hey, what's going on?

178
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,390
We've had clients two days in row?! Must be a special version of the show!

179
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,900
H-Here's some tea for you.

180
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,940
Hot!

181
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,460
Oops!

182
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,040
Um...

183
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,380
You're really in for it if this is a joke!

184
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,800
What? You're shocked and getting uppity?

185
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,400
So what can we do for you?

186
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,460
Well, I... want to get something back that I lost.

187
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,130
Something very important to me.

188
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,880
Well, what did you lose?

189
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,270
Well...  I need about thirty million yen to get it back.

190
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,290
Listen, baldy! I said you were in for it if this was a joke, remember?!

191
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,340
What's an easy way to earn money? Every time I grab it, it runs through my fingers...

192
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,900
Ah-ha, that's it! Every time you move your hand, we go further into the red!

193
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,120
But I heard you would take any kinds of jobs for troubled people.

194
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,130
We can't even pay our rent now!

195
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,670
There's no way we can take care of someone's business! Don't come here again!

196
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,670
Calm down, both of you. So, what would you do with the money if you had it?

197
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,310
A month ago, I ended up as dead weight at the company and got laid off.

198
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,950
And three weeks ago, I was swindled and lost my house.

199
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,410
Then two weeks ago, my wife and daughter left me, without even leaving a note.

200
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,010
And one week ago...

201
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,440
Why did you stop?!

202
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,290
Spit it out! Do tragedies like this befall you every single week?!

203
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,910
Tell us what happened to you last week!

204
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,390
Would you... like to hear the rest?

205
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,850
Why will he tell us the rest only after we complete the job?

206
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,050
Whatever, I'm sure we won't be able to complete this job.

207
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,980
Um...

208
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,790
Where are we going?

209
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,240
All right...  The point is that we get the money as quickly as possible, right?

210
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,280
Welcome...  Oh, it's you guys.

211
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,330
Otose. Proprietor of Otose Snack House and Gintoki's landlord.

212
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,520
I see.

213
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,410
You guys are such dopes.

214
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:29,150
If you could make money that quickly, there would be no thieves in the world! Idiots!

215
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,480
So says the ex-thief!

216
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,060
Indeed.

217
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,540
Catherine. Works for Snack House Otose. She came to Earth as a migrant worker.

218
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,890
Well, there might be one way...

219
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,330
So, what'll it be?

220
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,630
Well...  Um...

221
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,810
You've got two of those, so why don't you sell one?

222
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,870
You'd sell one if you were a real man!

223
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,450
This isn't gonna work.

224
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,360
So disappointing. You're just a big talker.

225
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,030
It's not going to happen if you're not prepared, right?

226
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,490
Forget it. It won't happen.

227
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,490
Oh hello, everyone. Fancy meeting you here!

228
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,050
Ayame Sarutobi. Nickname: Sachan. An elite ninja and a former a member of the Oniwabanshu.

229
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,840
What?

230
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,140
A way to get money quickly?

231
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,350
Sachan, why don't you put your glasses on?

232
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,210
You're getting on everyone's nerves. I don't care if your character looks like mine.

233
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,580
What are you talking about?

234
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,460
I couldn't care less about you.

235
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,470
All I care about is...

236
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,870
...you, Gin.

237
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,030
See?! I told you it would help to put on your glasses!

238
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,740
I see.

239
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,750
So the money you were talking about is not for the purchase of our little love nest?

240
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,710
Our love nest?

241
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,280
Man, I can't even bear to think about sitting next to you at the diner.

242
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,170
Always so cold, as usual.

243
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,320
But I don't give up so easily.

244
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,210
And what's with the natto, anyway?

245
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:10,400
[natto = fermented soy beans; popular as a diet food]

246
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,400
Just holding on to it isn't gonna help you you'll lose weight. Seriously.

247
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,710
Oh? Do you think that pushing me away is going to make me happy?

248
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,550
Stop blabbering, and do something with the natto, you natto woman!

249
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,460
Here we go!

250
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,020
That's it! Just like that!

251
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,240
More! More! Just keep blasting away at me!

252
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,280
You're really turning me on!

253
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,260
What's this? It stinks!

254
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,360
What's that smell?

255
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,430
Smells like natto and masochism.

256
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,410
Kato.

257
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,960
Yo, Kato. How's it going?

258
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,120
Well, uh...

259
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,350
I bet that was hard on you, huh?!

260
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,550
You put your seal on a contract like that? You'd better be more careful as to what you agree to.

261
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,780
Too bad. We know you're hard up.

262
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,890
Huh? How did you know?

263
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,230
Anyway, what have you been doing lately?

264
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,650
Well, I'm trying to work hard and buy my house back...

265
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,530
Buy it back? That'll never happen.

266
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,530
Because...

267
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,350
Hey...

268
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,800
W-Well...  That's right...

269
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,910
Well, let us know when you find a house.

270
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,240
We'll at least send a New Year's card when you do, Kato.

271
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,870
Take a bath!

272
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,000
Brush your teeth!

273
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,960
See you next week!

274
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,930
Hey, you...

275
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,770
Yes?

276
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,390
Maybe you oughta rethink your request.

277
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,130
I'm available for assassination jobs since I'm a professional killer.

278
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,530
Let's kill them!

279
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,390
Why don't we roll them up and throw 'em into the ditch now?!

280
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,810
No, wait.

281
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm changing my request.

282
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,450
But it's not going to be assassination.

283
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,680
I... want to be stronger!

284
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,000
We got it!

285
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,400
Hey, everyone...

286
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,390
Well, at any rate, we can jack up his hit points another hundred or so.

287
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,320
So where are you going, Gin?

288
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,680
I have something to take care of.

289
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,640
That's all.

290
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,570
I see.

291
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,280
Oh, so this is a blueprint...

292
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,980
Isao Kondo. Commander of the Shinsengumi. Strikes fear in the hearts of others.

293
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,900
By the way, Hijikata...

294
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,640
I have no idea what this says...

295
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,840
I've been trying to explain that this is a blueprint for an Amanto device, Kondo!

296
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,250
I see. Some sort of device...

297
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,360
Yes, and someone seems to be planning to use that device for some heinous deed here in Edo.

298
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,340
Toshi...

299
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,380
What does "heinous deed" mean?

300
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,390
You haven't heard a word I said!

301
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,530
[Drift Star Embassy]

302
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,250
An embassy?

303
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,250
Gintoki.

304
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,190
Zura?

305
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,220
It's not Zura. It's Katsura.

306
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,720
Kotaro Katsura. Member of the exclusionist rebels. An activist trying to rid Edo of aliens called Amanto.

307
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,460
Elizabeth. What the hell is this?

308
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,190
Gintoki, what are you doing here?

309
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:46,030
Well...  you know, jogging, taking a walk, something like that... I'm not really sure, you know...

310
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,510
Very well.

311
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,780
What do you mean?

312
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,190
I heard some dangerous rumors around here.

313
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,290
Rumors?

314
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,110
I've heard about an Amanto who's plotting to destroy all of Edo.

315
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,760
Why would an Amanto do something like that?

316
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,910
I don't know...  But if it's true, we must punish them.

317
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,910
Gintoki, I don't know what you're going to do, but you'd better be careful.

318
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,450
The Embassy is considered foreign soil.

319
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,310
Foreign soil...

320
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,190
I should be careful, then.

321
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,030
Later, Zura.

322
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,430
It's not Zura. It's Katsura.

323
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,420
That hat is so out of style.

324
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,790
Okay! Why don't you give it a try?

325
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,710
He can't do that!

326
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,490
What are you talking about? It's easy!

327
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,710
Suppress your inner "self" and even you can look like Antonio Inoki.

328
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,600
I have no idea what you're talking about.

329
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,870
Okay, you can start any time.

330
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,790
Right...

331
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,230
What? Your eyes are bloodshot. Were you up all night playing Tetris?

332
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,750
The game is just about to begin.

333
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,680
Give it a rest.

334
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,550
Something bad could happen if you swing that toy around like that.

335
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,060
Did he notice my sword cane?

336
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,240
Whatever, but can you at least tell me why you're trying to kill me?

337
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,100
Don't play dumb! We already know you're nosing around.

338
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,890
Wrong. That was Zura. It wasn't me.

339
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,260
No more discussion!

340
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,090
An earthquake?

341
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,970
You're leaving yourself wide open!

342
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,580
You think you'll become stronger like that?! Dumbass!

343
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,810
You're surprisingly intense.

344
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,570
Ah, I'm sorry. Are you all right?

345
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,510
Get up! Stand up! Katoken!

346
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:24,600
Listen! Keep your elbows close to your body and strike, strike, and strike!

347
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,610
Wait! That's a jab.

348
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,770
That won't work for tomorrow, right? It doesn't have anything to do with swordsmanship!

349
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,110
Cross Namida Bridge carefully!

350
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,880
It looks like it's my turn.

351
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,310
I'll make you stronger!

352
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,700
Stronger!

353
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,870
L-Like this?

354
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,330
More! More!

355
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,090
Oh yes!

356
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,250
That's it. Good!

357
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,870
How about this?!

358
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,820
You have potential.

359
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,130
What is this training for?

360
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,430
What kind of potential does he have?!

361
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,100
As a dominatrix...

362
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,410
He's a man! Anyway, that's not the point!

363
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,090
Oh, you're very patient! You'll get another appetizer!

364
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,120
Untie me now!

365
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,890
Um...

366
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,100
Thank you so much, but that's enough.

367
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,050
I don't think I'll ever get any stronger.

368
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,440
I give up...

369
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,860
Huh? B-But...

370
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,780
So I'll just leave.

371
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,490
Katoken...

372
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,310
Boy, my best clothes... ruined. My mom is going to be really mad, you bastard!

373
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,020
You'd better be more worried about your life than your clothes!

374
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,820
Who is Shishimura, Gintoki's mysterious attacker?

375
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,970
And what heinous deed is Kariya the Amanto planning?

376
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,260
Did Kato really give up?

377
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,190
It's time to say good-bye to those who live in a certain area.

378
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,200
For the rest of you, please keep watching!

379
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,500
