00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,180
There're things in this world you're better off not knowing about.

3
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,250
[Gin-san's illegitimate child is revealed! Or so we thought. The case escalates to the matter of the child being the heir of a wealthy merchant.]

4
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,760
[Ofusa, the mother of baby Kanshichiro. Kahei Hashidaya, a truly dangerous man.]

5
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,910
Excuse me. I...um...have nothing to do with this, so can I go home?

6
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,760
Kagura-chan!

7
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,510
How would like your coffee? With sugar or milk?

8
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,010
But coffee tastes best with...

9
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,370
sugar...isn't that right?!

10
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,730
A smokescreen?

11
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,350
You, meddling scum!

12
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,010
Damn it! The woman! The woman escaped!

13
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,320
Search the entrance! She has to be somewhere in this room!

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,980
A smokescreen... But it won't work against me.

15
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,670
There's something different about the airflow. The smoke is flowing out somewhere...

16
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,360
I wonder where...

17
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,510
There...

18
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,850
["If You Want to See Someone, Make an Appo First"]

19
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,410
I said I want to meet the president.

20
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,580
Excuse me, but do you have an "apo"?

21
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,580
[Note: Apo is short for appointment in Japan]

22
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,140
What's an "apo"? Oh, you mean that? A kind of fruit from the north?

23
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,330
Does the president like Fuji apples?

24
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,940
It's not an apple. Why are you saying only certain parts in English?!

25
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,570
Give me a break. "Apo" or Kobo-chan...

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,570
[Note: Kobo-chan is a four-cell manga on newspaper, like a comic strip.]

27
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,240
I just want to see the president.

28
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,090
Apo.

29
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,020
That's right. Nowadays, you can't do anything in Japan without slogging through a mountain of red tape.

30
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,240
Ah! What's Japan coming to?!

31
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,400
E-Excuse me, but could you please not speak so loud?

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,110
Ah?

33
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,860
Wait a minute. That child could be the president's...

34
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,820
What? What is that?

35
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,000
Ah! Excuse me, but you can't go in there without permission!

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,070
Please wait!

37
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,540
Apo.

38
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,430
Napo.

39
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,980
Oh, no! We're done for! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

40
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,670
My lungs! My lungs hurt! It's like they're bursting! I've made up my mind!

41
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,090
From this day forth, I will quit smoking and quit hanging with you guys!

42
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,990
Where's Kagura-chan? She's not here!

43
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,970
No kidding...

44
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,710
W-Wait a minute...

45
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,160
We're still here! We're still here!

46
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,190
Wait!

47
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,970
Unbelievable! He's like a monster or something!

48
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,440
We don't stand a chance against him! Run!!

49
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,080
All right!

50
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,170
Well, weren't we already running away in the beginning?

51
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,790
Damn it!

52
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,030
Hey!

53
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,290
Are you all right?

54
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,760
Ah! We're gonna fall!!

55
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,640
What?! They disappeared! Where did they go?!

56
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,500
Damn it! Let's check over there!

57
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,280
Um... Are you all right?

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,580
What a relief! There was another roof underneath.

59
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,860
Oh, I was so scared I almost wet my pants.

60
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,970
Well, who are you guys?

61
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,300
It was you, right? The one who left the baby in front of our house?

62
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,440
N-No kidding...

63
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,700
Huh? So, you guys...

64
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,940
Don't worry. The baby has been taken into protective custody.

65
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,620
I'm 38 already ...

66
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,870
Really?! Kanshichiro... Kanshichiro is safe?!

67
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,380
Oh, I must have gotten this while cleaning! So if I take off my apron...

68
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,140
Whoa! Hey, hey! Calm down. Please calm down!

69
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,150
You're the baby's mother, right?

70
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:42,520
Can you tell us what happened? I think we have the right to know at least.

71
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,190
I was from a poor family,

72
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,360
So I was sent to work as a servant here at the Hashidaya.

73
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,570
My job was to take care of the master's son, Kantaro-sama, who was sickly and bedridden.

74
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,810
Um... I'm Ofusa... I'm honored to be working for you.

75
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,160
Ah, you're the new servant. Nice to...

76
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,110
Somebody help! Somebody!

77
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,490
Somebody, please!

78
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,330
[Surprise!]

79
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,550
Gotcha! That was a surprise!

80
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,480
Somebody help!! Kantaro-sama is... Kantaro-sama is...!

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,760
Well...hey...look over here...

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,100
Kantaro-sama is dead!

83
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,930
No, I'm not. Hey, over here...

84
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,260
Someone!

85
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,190
Hey! Are you listening to me?!

86
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:42,300
Kantaro-sama loved to joke around. And he often played tricks on his servants.

87
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:49,030
But he was also a very kind person, who treated me like a friend.

88
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,160
And I gradually grew attracted to him.

89
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,400
Ofusa, how much longer do I have to stay bedridden?

90
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,100
There you go again. You've been coughing a lot today, so you can't go for a walk.

91
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,800
I know I won't live very long. Well, if I live lazy like this, I might live a bit longer.

92
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,940
The master would be sad to hear you say that.

93
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,990
Master is trying very hard to cure your illness, Kantaro-sama.

94
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:27,370
That old man just wants me to succeed him to protect his fortune.

95
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,960
Fortune and living a long life... Are they really that important?

96
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,420
It sounds to me like you're being selfish.

97
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,780
It's the selfishness of someone who already has everything.

98
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,110
Maybe so.

99
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,180
If that's the case, I don't need anything.

100
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,910
Let's say...

101
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,390
I'd rather be like a cherry blossom.

102
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,920
Cherry blossom?

103
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,410
Kantaro-sama, but if you turn into a cherry blossom, you'll wither away before spring ends.

104
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,010
That's the way it should be.

105
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,580
They're brilliant and fully bloomed, just like that.

106
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:14,950
Six months later, Kantaro-sama and I left the house and ran away together.

107
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,000
I knew it was wrong, but I wanted to make Kantaro-sama happy.

108
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,690
We started living together.

109
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,600
Our lives were difficult, but we worked really hard.

110
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,010
Crying and laughing... We were so happy... However...

111
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,210
I finally track you down and look at you.

112
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,800
If you had stayed home and kept to your bed like I told you to,

113
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,200
your illness wouldn't have taken a turn for the worse.

114
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,910
You were deceived by that nasty woman.

115
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,020
This is all your fault! Anyway, I'm taking Kantaro back home.

116
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,450
Please wait, Master!

117
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,120
Shut up!

118
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,520
It can't be... You're carrying... Kantaro's...

119
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,290
Abort it. If word of this got out, the family name would be tarnished.

120
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:22,450
After that, Kantaro-sama and I were not allowed to see each other anymore.

121
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,280
Until he passed away...

122
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,940
Then Kanshichiro was born.

123
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,920
I decided to do my best to raise him.

124
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,520
Master!

125
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:49,250
Master had lost his only son, so he had his eye on Kanshichiro as his heir.

126
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,540
I lost Kantaro-sama,

127
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,540
and I couldn't stand losing Kanshichiro, too.

128
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,980
But they kept chasing me.

129
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,000
And I knew it was only a matter of time before Kanshichiro and I were captured.

130
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,590
I'm sorry, but I'll come back for you...

131
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,010
Please forgive me...

134
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,060
I feel sorry about what I did. I got you guys involved in this for my own selfish reasons.

135
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,830
Ofusa-chan, you're a young woman whose had a tough life, huh?

136
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,480
But it sounds like that bastard Kahei is a real lowlife.

137
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,160
That woman is the lowlife.

138
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,550
That wench killed my only son.

139
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,050
If it weren't for her, my company would be secure.

140
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:59,270
I planned for Kantaro to become my heir and then my life's work would've been complete.

141
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,710
But that vulgar, lowborn woman ruined everything.

142
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,260
Do you have any idea what I endured for the sake of this company?

143
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,530
I groveled in the mud, I hobnobbed with human scum, I even betrayed my own conscience.

144
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,350
Can you understand my feelings?!

145
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,900
Kantaro-sama hated that part of you.

146
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,330
Why are you so obsessed with this business? Is it money? Or power?

147
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,870
Humph! A woman like you will never understand...

148
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,610
A man spends his entire life trying to create a single work of art.

149
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,020
Art is infinite in variety, from one person to another and takes on many forms.

150
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,550
For me, it's the Hashidaya.

151
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,880
No matter what, I have to finish my masterwork.

152
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,160
I will sink to any depth to protect it.

153
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,440
Go!

154
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,240
Hey, is this the president's office?

155
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,740
Wh-What?!

156
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,660
So, this is what...I need to see you, right?

157
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,020
Apo.

158
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,110
Napo.

159
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,450
What? Bastard! Who the hell are you?!

160
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,530
Huh? Who am I?

161
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,370
That's right. I'm...

162
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,500
...a babysitting lone wolf.

163
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,400
Gin-san!

164
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,510
Kanshichiro!

165
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,850
It seems things have got way more complicated here. Shinpachi, explain it in thirty words or less.

166
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,400
That's impossible, Gin-san. Why are you here? You explain it in thirty words or less.

167
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,010
Impossible.

168
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,780
Are you crazy?! Why would you bring the baby into enemy territory?!

169
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,040
What's with you? I just saved your butt.

170
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,730
What are you doing here anyway? In thirty words or less.

171
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,020
Shut up!

172
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,250
That old man is trying to steal that kid! His son knocked up the kid's mother.

173
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,710
And now the old man's knocking her down.

174
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,800
He wouldn't accept the tyke while his son was alive, but now that his son's dead...

175
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,660
He wants the kid to become his heir!

176
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,930
Hey, hey. I came here to return the kid, but I guess I'll have to change my plan.

177
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:29,230
This is nonsense! He's my grandson. He's the heir to the Hashidaya. Hand him over.

178
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,500
I really don't care whether I give you to your grandpa or your mother

179
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,780
as long as I'm not stuck with you anymore, but...

180
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,480
Hey, what do you think?

181
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,590
Oh, I see, I see.

182
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,480
Sorry, old man.

183
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,970
He said he'd rather suck momma's flat chest than suck on your hairy old teats.

184
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,910
Please stop! Please stop using such disgusting expressions!

185
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,510
Do you think you can outrun us? We've got an ace up our sleeve.

186
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,160
[Note: Iai, as in Iai jutsu, are techniques for drawing a sword.]

187
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,160
Although he's blind, he's a master of Iai.

188
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,790
He's also a master assassin who can kill anyone with one unstoppable blow.

189
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,700
His name is Nizo Okada. Otherwise known as...Nizo the butcher.

190
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,960
Yo, I knew I'd see you again.

191
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,270
I've seen you before... You were blind?!

192
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:28,000
Both of your hands are free this time. I'm glad. Now we can fight for real.

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,750
Nizo! As long as we have Kanshichiro, we've won half the battle! Kill them all!

194
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:39,260
Gin-san! Be careful! That guy is a master of Iai! So don't let his timing affect you!

195
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:39,260
[Note: Timing is one of the elements of Iai jutsu.]

196
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,140
Gin-san!

197
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,950
Kanshichiro!

198
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,730
That's not good.

199
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,330
You should've held on tighter to your baby.

200
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,730
Eh, Mother?

201
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,980
Kanshichiro!

202
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:06,080
Great job, Nizo. That was quick and fearless! I'll just sit back and enjoy the show.

203
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,530
I'm sorry, Master... It seems I won't be able to put this guy away as easily as I thought.

204
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,360
Sorry, but you'd better take the child and quickly go.

205
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,000
Kanshichiro!

206
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,590
Hey, hey! Don't move so much!

207
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,640
Wh-What's the matter?! Hey!

208
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,670
Hey, hey. He seems to hate you, doesn't he?!

209
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,320
When he was with me, he was as quiet as a middle school boy on his first date.

210
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,350
Should I teach you how to soothe him?

211
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,560
What?!

212
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,420
In general, a grandchild likes his grandpa.

213
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,520
You're not qualified to be his grandpa, are you?

214
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,250
Shut up!

215
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,320
Nizo!

216
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,270
Go for the kill!

217
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,030
Shinpachi, Kagura, I'll be fine. You go after the kid and the old man.

218
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,210
But!

219
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,430
Just go!

220
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,260
Gin-chan!

221
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,260
Gin-san!

222
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,770
Later...

223
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,640
I promise to meet you later.

224
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,750
Are you sure? A samurai shouldn't make a promise he can't keep.

225
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,150
No sweat. I'm more dependable than I look.

226
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,760
I'm the type of guy who arrives for a date 30 minutes early.

227
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,940
You're such a funny man, just like I thought.

228
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,510
I lost my eyesight to a disease when I was young.

229
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,330
But humans are tough creatures.

230
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,380
The other senses grow more acute to compensate for the loss of vision.

231
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,960
Because of that, my nose, ears and intuition have become very sharp.

232
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,640
My whole body works as my eye. I see the world more fully than before.

233
00:16:50,640 --> 00:17:00,330
Have you ever seen what comes out of a man the moment he dies? I wonder if it's his soul.

234
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,500
It's released at the same time I kill a person...

235
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,400
And it's such a beautiful color.

236
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,810
So I kept chasing it, and people started calling me the butcher.

237
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,530
So, what color is your soul?

238
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,100
You... Your eyes are even better than Sankon-san's?

239
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,100
[Note: Osuman Youla Sankhon is a Guinean performer on Japanese TV who was known for having exceptional eyesight.]

240
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,370
I don't care if your whole body is your eyeball, or that old man's eyeball.

241
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,390
But I don't need any special powers to see.

242
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,990
I can see... The color of your grimy soul. It's the color of a turd.

243
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,110
The only kind of person who can kill people is a piece of crap

244
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,360
who doesn't even try to understand the feelings of others.

245
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,790
Even if your whole body can see, your soul can't see anything.

246
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,540
Want to find out?

247
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,210
Come on. I'll smash your skull into pieces!

248
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,420
You asked for it...

249
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,120
Was I too fast for you? Now which one of us is blind?

250
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,960
[Refreshing Nose]

251
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,830
What's wrong? Did you see an illusion of me dying?

252
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,570
I-Impossible! I just killed him, I'm sure of it...

253
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,270
Wh-Why?

254
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,730
My sword blade...

255
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,910
Your Iai was quick on the draw. But this time it worked against you.

256
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,850
It can't be! His first strike broke my blade?!

257
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,430
He was even faster than my speedy Batto jutsu?

258
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,430
[Note: Batto jutsu are techniques for drawing a sword. Also called Iai jutsu.]

259
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,590
I thought I cut him, but that was only in my head!

260
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,760
I already told you. Your soul can't see a thing.

261
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,820
A bit more...

262
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,380
You should open your soul and live!

263
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,350
S-Stay back! Kanshichiro is my grandson!

264
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,960
The Hashidaya is also mine! No one can take them away from me!

265
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,520
You can do whatever you like with the Hashidaya. But that child is my son.

266
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,170
Damn you, woman.

267
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,880
You took Kantaro away from me and now you're trying to take Kanshichiro and the Hashidaya away, too?

268
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,640
H-Hey! Be quiet!

269
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,420
Kanshichiro can hear...

270
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,710
...what you're saying.

271
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,010
Impossible! What can a baby like this understand?

272
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,260
He understands. And he remembers.

273
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,330
All babies do. Especially the memory of being held tenderly...

274
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,840
Kantaro-sama always told me that.

275
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,320
There was an altar covered with flowers and a picture of a beautiful woman...

276
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,790
Don't worry... Everything will be all right. We'll survive somehow.

277
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,830
We'll be fine...

278
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,820
I'll cook the meals and change the diapers...

279
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,720
Well, I don't know how to, but I'll change the diapers somehow...

280
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,710
So you can go on without a worry.

281
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,020
I'll protect Kantaro and the Hashidaya.

282
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,200
Do you think what you're doing would make Kantaro-sama and your wife happy?

283
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,300
Kantaro was born sickly.

284
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,360
The doctor said he would, at the most, live one-third a normal lifetime.

285
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,800
After hearing that, my wife said that we would make him three times happier.

286
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:30,970
Like a cherry blossom--he can live a full life, even if it's short.

287
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,640
But I wasn't as clever as my wife.

288
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,980
I hired all the doctors I could and raised my son like a bird in a cage.

289
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,190
I wanted them alive in any way possible. My wife...

290
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,760
And Kantaro...

291
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,600
Now, I've lost everything. I couldn't keep any of my promises after all...

292
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,960
You haven't lost everything.

293
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,210
In fact... See?

294
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,000
Kanshichiro...

295
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,070
Kanshichiro is my child.

296
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,350
But he's also your grandson.

297
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,300
So the next time you visit my house, it won't be as the master of Hashidaya,

298
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,340
but as a grandfather who loves his grandson.

299
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,170
And we'll have tea and cakes together.

300
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,140
I guess no one can beat a mother. It's like, "Mothers are strong," huh?

301
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,440
Hey, why are you wearing a diaper? Hey!

302
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,000
So, it's time for us to go home.

303
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,150
Thank you so much for everything. I'll never forget what you did for us.

304
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,260
Please don't remember me losing my dignity as a person.

305
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,500
How is it? Taste good?

306
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,440
What? The milk isn't good enough for you?

307
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,070
Hey, hey. It's a hundred years too early for you.

308
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,940
You can start drinking sake after you at least grow some hair in a few places.

309
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,070
Yeah... When you're a little older...

310
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,550
...and if you still remember me.

311
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,020
