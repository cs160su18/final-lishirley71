I have to be "It"?

6
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,900
One. Two.

Three. Four. Five.

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,850
Stop that. Boys shouldn't cry so much. And you call yourself a samurai?

9
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,190
You say the same thing grandpa says, Tae-chan.

10
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,300
Samurai...samurai... Do samurai have to be that strong?

11
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,820
I always get teased-they call me "Shrimp! Shrimp!"

12
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,690
I'm smaller than you, Tae-chan, and you're a girl.

13
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,080
A shrimp weakling like me could never become a samurai.

You'll get bigger when you grow up.

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,480
No I won't. Both father and grandfather are small; my entire clan is small.

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,440
So what if you're small? Pepper grains are tiny, but they're spicy hot, right?

17
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,510
Tae-chan...

18
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,880
According to my data, more small people become company presidents and big shots.

19
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,150
Where did you get that data, Tae-chan?

20
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:42,070
[Note: This line in Japanese is "tama no koshi" which literally translate to "balls between my legs" or is a reference when a poor woman marries a rich men, thus the "Cinderella" remark.]

Father tells me to be like the balls between the legs.

22
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,070
Don't you mean "like Cinderella"? You're mixing things up.

23
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,200
If you're shorter than everyone else,

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,550
then you should become a samurai with a bigger heart than everyone else, Kyu-chan.

25
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,140
All right, then, Otae-chan, if I become a strong samurai with a big heart,

26
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,710
Otae-chan...would you be...my...

Hijikata-han came today instead of that gorilla!

35

Sit over here by me, Hijikata-han.

36

Just when I thought that gorilla was now behaving himself, you show up.

What's going on here? Is this some sort of humble threat?

The truth is...

70
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,140
Kondo-san received a marriage proposal.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,590
He's nearly thirty.

72
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,320
It's an offer that came from the higher-ups out of consideration for his public image.

73
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,540
But he's exhausted from your constant rejections,

74
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,490
so he's at the point where he'll go for any female.

That girl's cute, don't you think, Toshi?

He'll probably accept this offer.

Oh, I'm glad for him.

79
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,500
That'll put an end to his stalking,

The prospect is Bubbles-sama of the Planet Shojo. So he's marrying up.

They say husband and wife start to look alike,

84
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,920

You're the only one who can stop the Chief!

It'll be fine. They say a hairy woman is very compassionate.

91
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,580
I'm sure she'll be a good wife.

92
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,500
She's got too much hair! Too much compassion, hair and chiseled features!

93
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,760
As you can see, we're begging you, Miss.

We won't insist that you marry him! Just stop him.

95
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,120
This many men bowing their heads to beg you for help is a true display of our sincerity!

96

We know you'll understand because you're a woman who understands duty and integrity-

Oh? Where's the sincerity?

98

You guys are too persistent!

Just a minute, Otae-chan.

101
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,420
If I did that, he'd get the wrong idea...

102
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,080
and want to stalk me even more!

103

Hello? Kondo-san? It was no use, after all.

104

You have no choice but to resign yourself...

105
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,530
You say her refusal shows she likes you? No, I'd say "No means no."

106
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,720
And another thing-don't send me on errands like this again.

No matter how you look at it, we're the one's getting pounded!

Despite that, we're still samurai.

You think it's okay to be in a place like this?

Hey, jerk. What'd you just say?

120
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,790
I am...

121

I'm no kid.

Huh? Your sister stayed out all night?

125
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,040
That's right. All night... Though because of her job she always comes home late.

126
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,590
But today, she came home even later than usual

127
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,910
and didn't even look at me before changing clothes and heading out again.

128

Shinpachi, in such situations, keep quiet and cook red rice with beans for her.

Stop it!

130
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,900
My sister wouldn't do anything like that until she's married.

131
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,160
I'll beat the guy up.

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,480
If the guy's the man she plans to marry, then you can't be sure. She'll beat you up.

133
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,490
She has no such person! I won't allow it!

134
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,260
Stop being so obsessed with your sister, Shinpachi-kun.

135
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,200
You and your sister, by law, can't get married.

136
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,480
She's finally ready to tear off the heavy chains you wrapped around her

137
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,280
and take wing to the sweet world of adulthood.

Oops.

139
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,650
When that happens,

the younger brother has no choice but to keep quiet and become a red-rice-with-beans-making machine.

You can cry as you work as a red-rice-with-beans-making machine.

You can cry and eat buns with beans, you brat.

Well then, let's have lunch.

Hey Kondo, what're you doing?

Hey, pull yourself together. Nervous?

152

I don't blame you. It's your first arranged introduction.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,420
Fact is, my wife and I were an arranged marriage.

154
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,700
I sure was nervous.

155
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,000
She was a lot pettier than her photo, so I was a nervous wreck.

156
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,350
Truth is, you can't trust a marriage prospect's photo, Kondo.

157
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,910
She looks a bit like a gorilla in this photo, but she's actually a beauty with deep-set features.

158
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,790
Like a gorilla? She is a gorilla. A gorilla, pure and simple.

159
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,790
No, you're wrong. She's, you know...taking a photo makes you tense.

160
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,530
She's so stiff that it makes her look like a gorilla.

161
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,270
What do you mean she looks like a gorilla because she's stiff?

162
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,280
No one grows fur all over their body because they're stiff!

163
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,740
Make up your mind to do it, Kondo.

164
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,250
Frankly, this match is for political reasons.

165
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,150
Planet Shojo and Earth have repeatedly had diplomatic clashes.

166
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,720
You were chosen to help resolve this situation.

167
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,570
An eye for an eye, a gorilla for a gorilla!

168
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,840
Please do it, Kondo.

169
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,970
The fate of the Earth rests on your shoulders.

170
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,350
We reserved this fancy Japanese-style restaurant just for this purpose.

171
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,450
Make sure you woo the Princess.

172
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,740
That's what you say, but Pops, she's...a gorilla.

173
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,550
That's why I'm telling you not to think about the photo.

174
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,400
You should imagine her as being three times as beautiful as you expect.

175
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,100
Trust this old man.

176
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,760
Okay, I'm going in.

177
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,390
Excuse me.

178
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,860
See, see. A real beauty.

179
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,560
She's three times as big a gorilla as I imagined!

180
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,330
What's the matter, Tae-chan?

181
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,220
Nothing. I just thought I saw a gorilla.

182
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,510
There you go again...talking nonsense.

183
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,910
You're a funny person, as usual, Tae-chan.

184
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,040
Uh...

185
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,150
Princess Bubbles, what are your interests?

186
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,630
Uho.

187
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,630
Oh, that... How nice that is.

188
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,270
Like a...only... But if you overdo it, you'll hurt your shoulders... You won't?

189
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,030
This isn't good. I have no idea what she's saying.

190
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,000
No, that's not right...you fry it? Vegetables?

191
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,680
Does she understand my words?

192
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,750
It might be my imagination, but she looks to be in a bad mood.

193
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,240
Or, actually, I can't tell if she's in a good mood or a bad mood.

194
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,510
This isn't good! At this rate, the Earth will be destroyed.

195
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,410
I'm so nervous, I want to poop.

196
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,170
What'll I do? What can I do to excuse myself without offending her?

197
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,630
Maybe I'll just say, "Uho." If I add gestures, that should get it across.

198
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,000
Uho.

199
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,490
[Translation: Would you like to go for a walk in the garden?]

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,400
Hey! What? Why is she coming with me? I don't believe it! Oh no!

201
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,060
It really has been ages.

202
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,460
I heard from your grandfather that you went on a journey to train in the martial arts,

203
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,010
but I had no idea you had come this way... You should've told me.

204
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,790
No one knows that I've returned, yet.

205
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,820
That's because I came straight to see you first.

206
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,460
I missed you...

207
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,730
Just a minute...

208
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,290
Do you remember the promise we made back then?

209
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,230
I've kept my promise and have become strong.

210
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,760
Now it's your turn to keep your promise, Tae-chan.

211
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Pri...

212
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,570
Princess... How did a roof tile...?

213
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,970
Sorry. It slipped.

214
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,810
Ah, two gorillas!

215
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,580
Oh, yes.

216
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,370
Most of the repairs are done, so please tell him the rain won't leak through again.

217
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,440
We got quite a bit.

218
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,850
Maybe I'll bring home some Baagen-Dash for Sis.

219
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,890
I'm sure I was just worried about nothing.

220
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,160
Sis would never return home the next morning with some total stranger.

221
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,420
Stop that... Just a minute...

222
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,730
Stop it!

223
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,100
Wh-What are you...

224
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,250
Princess Bubbles! Are you all right? Princess Bubbles!

225
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,910
This is bad! She's totally angry.

226
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,160
My butt let one go! It's completely...

227
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,910
Plus, we ran into the worst possible people.

228
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,220
Hey, what're you doing here?

229
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,170
Weren't popular with the girls, so now you've started going out with a gorilla?

230
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,840
That's going too far, Kagura.

231
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,100
There are things you shouldn't even joke about.

232
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,460
That's his younger brother or something.

233
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,280
I can't tell them.

234
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,890
I can't say I'm having a marriage meeting with a gorilla if my ass tears apart.

235
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,750
Oh...

236
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,710
Hey, don't be so harsh. This is a pet. My pet.

237
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,230
Pet? Seriously? You're keeping one this big?

238
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,720
She looked at me with doleful eyes at the pet shop, so...

239
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,640
Forgive me, Princess.

240
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,550
That you don't understand me is the one saving grace.

241
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,690
There, there. Have some.

242
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,930
Just a minute, what're you feeding her?!

243
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,250
The beans from a bean bun.

244
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,130
Beans from a bean bun?! What a terrible thing to feed the Princess!

245
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,370
What do you mean, "Princess"?

246
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,900
What?! You know, her name is Princess.

247
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,860
Anyway...my Princess-chan is not hungry right now.

248
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,690
You see? She spit it out. Please stop doing that...

249
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,910
Don't waste food!

250
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,060
Just a minute!

251
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,700
Really! Please stop that!

252
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,900
That's not right.

253
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,070
No matter how much you love her, you have to scold her when it's necessary.

254
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,780
Okay, I understand! I'll train her properly! So let her go!

255
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,370
This is bad. If this continues, there's no telling what they'll do to the Princess.

256
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,890
We were taking a walk, so we'd better get going...

257
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,450
Huh? What's that...?

258
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,970
It's a turd.

259
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,940
My god, no! I wore my hakama over boxers! It rolled out from the hakama.

260
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,240
Didn't that just roll out of your hakama?

261
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,680
It bounced off your foot.

262
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,490
Princess!

263
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,820
I told you not to go potty all over the place!

264
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,040
What am I going to do with you? You go potty everywhere.

265
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,840
What am I going to do with you? You've riled me into a frenzy.

266
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,470
No, it came from you.

267
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,750
Now see here, Sakata-kun. That's enough.

268
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,510
How old do you think I am? I'm almost thirty.

269
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,460
I wouldn't do anything like that.

270
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,930
Hey, thirty-ish, you're leaving a trail of "miso."

271
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,930
[Note: Miso is fermented soy bean paste that often looks like poop.]

272
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,410
You're mistaken.

273
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,670
This is, you know, biscuits I left as markers on the road so I wouldn't get lost.

274
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,800
You're already lost. Lost on the path of life.

275
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,770
Sh-Shin-chan.

276
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,670
Y-You've got it all wrong, Shin-chan. This is...

277
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,740
What are the two of you doing together? You two!

278
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,460
You bastard! What're you doing with my unwedded sister?!

279
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,460
Shin-chan!

280
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,310
So you're Shinpachi-kun?

281
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,400
Looks like you still can't let go of your sister. Isn't it about time you...

282
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,750
grew up?

283
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,880
Shin-chan.

284
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,930
It's time for you to leave.

285
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,590
If you're always like that, Tae-chan will be too worried to ever leave home.

286
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,540
Are you...

287
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,820
Kyubei-san. Kyubei Yagyu-san?

288
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,400
What's the idea of showing up out of the blue and telling me that?!

289
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,090
What do you mean by leave home?

290
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,560
Just that.

291
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,580
Perhaps you are unaware, but when we were young,

292
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,540
Tae-chan and I made a promise to become husband and wife.

293
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,800
We are engaged. From today on, she will be of the Yagyu clan.

294
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,160
Huh?!

295
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,600
Your sister became mine and no longer yours a long time ago.

296
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,710
What I do with her is not for you to complain about.

297
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,340
What're you talking about?!

298
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,300
A promise when you were young?! What good is a child's promise...?

299
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,620
Right, Sis?

300
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,350
Sis...

301
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,410
Sis! Why aren't you saying anything?!

302
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,500
Shin-chan, I'm sorry. I...

303
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,850
Sis...Why...

304
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,170
Sis!

305
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,860
Ow, ow, ow.

306
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,960
Hey! Do something about her! She's your pet, isn't she?!

307
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,610
No! She's actually a princess.

308
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,080
Huh? Otae-san?

309
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,810
Huh? What's going on? Did we drop in at a bad time?

310
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,450
Big Sis! What are you doing here?

311
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,210
Everyone...

312
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,120
farewell...

313
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,970
Hey.

314
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,220
Princess is coming!

315
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,550
Wait. Everyone apologize.

316
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,270
How?

317
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,870
Say "Uho."

318
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,410
Sis!

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,540
Not "Sis," say "Uho."

320
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,150
Oh man...

321
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,040
It was brand new.

322
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,500
Hijikata-san, is this the second fight you've lost?

323
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,390
I didn't lose. It's just that my sword cracked.

324
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,790
The boss of the Odd jobs broke it in two-you lost that one.

325
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,800
I didn't lose.

326
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,210
As long as you don't give up in your heart, it doesn't count as a loss.

327
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,300
That sounds just like you, Hijikata-san.

328
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,440
You didn't give up in your heart even after seeing

329
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,670
ten of your men beaten before your eyes.

330
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,370
I gotta love that thick skin of yours.

331
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,980
I can't use this anymore, so maybe I'll break it...while lopping off your head.

332
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,690
Hijikata-san, if he hadn't struck with the back of his sword,

333
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,910
he'd have killed every one of them.

334
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,680
I think he's a Yagyu...

335
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,840
The Yagyu are a prominent family that once served as martial art instructors to the Shogun's family.

336
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,630
Although swordsmanship has deteriorated following the arrival of the Amanto,

337
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,740
they say there are still many who knock on their doors to learn the art.

338
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,260
The successor to their clan is Kyubei Yagyu.

339
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,110
He's small in stature and has a face like a kid,

340
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,950
but he is a swordsman with frightening, lightning-fast moves.

341
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,060
They say he's a prodigy the likes of which the Yagyu clan has never seen before.

342
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,620
I thought his was simply the type of swordsmanship taught to prodigal sons at the dojo,

343
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,690
and that we would be superior in a real fight,

344
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,900
but it seems that our country swordsmanship is no match for his city swordsmanship.

345
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,270
Whether its swordsmanship or love... If he's her childhood betrothed,

346
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,020
there's no room for Kondo-san.

347
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,710
Sogo, don't underestimate Kondo-san.

348
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,930
At his marriage meeting, Kondo-san successfully wooed that princess.

349
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,860
I don't know the details, but it seems she took a liking to his toughness.

350
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,010
That man can do it if he tries.

351
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,970
So does that mean if everything goes according to plan,

352
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,830
that gorilla will become our mistress?

353
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,300
Shinpachi didn't come home today, either.

354
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,640
Taking days off without permission...

355
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,900
Maybe I should fire him.

356
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,190
Say, Gin-chan, is Big Sis ever coming back?

357
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,880
I heard she never came back after that.

358
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,710
A letter came from her saying she was training and couldn't come home.

359
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,460
Training to be a wife.

360
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,520
There're a lot of things to study before getting married.

361
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,490
The Yagyu clan is, after all, one of the most prestigious households around.

362
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,020
She's marrying into a wonderful family.

363
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,280
I dunno if it was a promise made as kids, but they're handling it well.

364
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,570
The Yagyu are even going to help out Shinpachi's family's dojo.

365
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,760
What more could they ask for?

366
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,930
Gin-chan... Mommy once told me:

367
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,030
You can only smile at the start of a marriage.

368
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,090
Sometimes you become a nasty hag.

369
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,310
But if you can smile again at the end, you've lived a good life.

370
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,670
Do you think Big Sis can die smiling?

371
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,480
Break time.

372
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,460
Big Sis is hiding something. She's forcing herself.

373
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,750
There's no doubt in my mind. It's a woman's intuition.

374
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,900
Don't be silly. You don't need intuition-it's totally obvious.

375
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,910
I'll turn everything to black.

376
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,490
Don't know what she's thinking, though.

377
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,490
That woman made her own choice.

378
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,860
Which means she'll probably smile.

379
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,350
...Tsk.

380
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,510
I saw something I shouldn't have.

381
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,170
Who are you people?

382
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,810
You want to join our school? I'm afraid we are the Yagyu, so...

383
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,630
We are a prestigious, traditional family, so unless you're celebrities...

384
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,720
Or are you here to challenge our dojo?

385
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,090
Better forget it. Right now, the Four Yagyu Aces are here...

386
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,740
Not at all.

387
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,730
We didn't come to do anything so dangerous as to challenge your dojo.

388
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,870
In-Intruders!

389
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,740
Why are you doing this when you know we are the Yagyu clan?!

390
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,650
I am Shinpachi Shimura of the Tendo Mushin Style and head of the Kodokan Dojo.

391
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,280
And I am his student, Isao Gorilla!

392
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,560
We've come to ask for a showdown with the nationally known Yagyu Style!

393
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,520
We have no interest in taking the Yagyu school name board. But...

394
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,920
We want you to return my sister!

395
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,990
Give back Otae-san!

396
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,760
Rebels!

397
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,460
Get them! There's only two of them! Surround them!

398
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,460
Wh-Who are you people?!

399
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,840
Sorry, there aren't just two.

400
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,100
Shinpachi, from today on, we're students, too.

401
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,210
What was your style again?
The Naturally Wavy Hair Style?

402
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,790
Gin-san! Kagura-chan!

403
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,080
You guys!

404
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,080
[To be continued]

405
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,610
The next episode... "Yesterday's Enemy, After All Is Said and Done, Is Still the Enemy."

406
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,520
[Gintoki and friends storm the Yagyu dojo to take back Otae from Kyubei.]

407
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,060
[But the Four Yagyu Aces were right there waiting for them!!]
