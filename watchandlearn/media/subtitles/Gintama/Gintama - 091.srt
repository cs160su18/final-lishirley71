You "beep." Die...

163
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,010
You said that to me, didn't you?

164
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,610
No, I didn't.

165
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,750
Like hell you didn't.

166
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,440
Then why do I have spit dripping down my face?

167
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,550
I missed. I'm sorry.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,500
Hey, listen up!

169
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm gonna try this one more time.

170
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,340
Look into this mirror and shout "beep"...

171
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,050
You lewd "beep"!

172
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,880
Where? Where do you want me to hurt you?

173
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,260
Come on, say it! You ugly "beep"!

174
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,880
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

175
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,540
You've gone too far! Is this some kind of S&M play?

176
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,010
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,050
When I saw the ugly reflection of myself in that mirror, I got excited...

178
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,230
What the hell are you here for anyway?

179
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,770
Here! Just spit here!

180
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,890
I just said to shout "beep" really loud, that's all!

181
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,560
Aim right here. Okay? Can you do that?

182
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,870
Yes, I can.

183
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,200
Good. Then do it!

184
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,610
You "beep"!!

185
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,870
You went too far.

186
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,620
We will now start the actual fasting training.

187
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,870
You may have gained weight by eating,

188
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,620
but that doesn't mean you'll lose weight if you stop eating.

189
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,130
It's not as simple as that.

190
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,170
You have to burn fat to lose it.

191
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,310
In other words, you must do what you people despise the most-exercise.

192
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,720
Starting today for one week,

193
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,290
you will do all the chores in this temple such as cleaning and laundry.

194
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,840
And because this is a fasting dojo, no meals will be served.

195
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,560
But in exchange, we will give you something that you people love...

196
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,620
[Potato Chips
Consommé flavor]

197
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,620
We'll give each of you one potato chip.

198
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,190
One potato chip? That's ridiculous!

199
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,100
She wants us to survive on one potato chip for seven days?

200
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,280
Are you kidding me?

201
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,910
Yeah!

202
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,730
Can you make mine lightly salted?

203
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,000
You're missing the point.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,910
Fine. You can have whatever flavor you want.

205
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,000
But you are not allowed to eat it.

206
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:41,750
Whoever eats their potato chip during the week will be immediately expelled.

207
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,440
W-Wait just a minute.

208
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,230
Can you make mine soy sauce butter flavor?

209
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,620
Never mind that right now!

210
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,010
You mean to tell me we'll have a sour cream and onion potato chip in front of our faces,

211
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,020
yet we're not allowed to eat it?

212
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,990
I see you've casually put in your flavor request.

213
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,600
Then why are you giving it to us?

214
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,670
And how can we survive a week without food?

215
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,080
I said you can't eat your own potato chip.

216
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,070
Could it be...this is a survival game?

217
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,620
By eating other people's chips and kicking them out of the game...

218
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,140
That's how we're supposed to survive for a week?

219
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,290
Fighting your friends over a chip...

220
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,270
And killing each other...

221
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,300
That's... That's unheard of...

222
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,930
Think of the chip as your life.

223
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,580
I suggest you treasure it.

224
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,550
Wait.

225
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,130
I...

226
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,500
I...

227
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,200
...want mine to be Italian basil flavor!

228
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,670
I see you're a bit of a maniac.

229
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,610
Today is the fifth day at the fasting dojo.

230
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,090
Before the program even started, half the participants left.

231
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,690
They lost their fighting spirit in the face of such harsh training.

232
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,260
And in five days, half of the remaining participants left, too.

233
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,970
They gave in to hunger and reached for their potato chip.

234
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,920
There were only six participants left.

235
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,010
Both your spirit and your stomach are sagging!

236
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,110
Stay focused!

237
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,820
In the last five days, nothing had passed through our lips.

238
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,220
The six of us have fought the temptation of the potato chip and battled with hunger.

239
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,170
We may have an enormous amount of willpower,

240
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,230
but even for us, we were approaching our limit.

241
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,070
I said you can't eat your own potato chip.

242
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,200
That's what the nun said.

243
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,580
In other words, in order to survive this test,

244
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,710
we must take someone's potato chip and eat it.

245
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,440
Unfortunately, after going through five days of hell together,

246
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,820
a strange sort of bond, almost like a friendship had developed between us.

247
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,410
Apparently a strong bond is formed when people go through difficult times together.

248
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,340
What kind of music do you listen to?

249
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,230
Enka.

250
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,230
[Note: Enka is traditional Japanese music.]

251
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,280
This was especially true for those who didn't get along before.

252
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,900
You look kinda cute today.

253
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,820
Oh come on, you're the one that's cute, Otae-san.

254
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,010
It was the same principle as "Jaian" in the movies.

255
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:27,310
[Note: Refers to "The Truth behind Jaian looking like a nice guy in the movie version" back in Ep. 63.]

256
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,310
I needed a legitimate reason to break through this friendly atmosphere.

257
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,290
A legitimate reason to take the potato chip.

258
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
Self defense.

259
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,430
This is my plan.

260
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,980
Leave a potato chip in front of these starved guys.

261
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,760
When they pounce on it,

262
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,220
That's mine!

263
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,430
That's when I defeat them!

264
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,280
And I'll eat their potato chip.

265
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,210
Someone tried to steal my potato chip so I attacked them.

266
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,990
No one can fault me for that.

267
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,700
However, this plan is very risky.

268
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,770
One wrong move and my potato chip could be eaten by another person.

269
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,270
I cannot allow my eyes to leave the potato chip for even a second.

270
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,650
I cannot even blink!

271
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,730
Ca-Catherine.

272
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,510
No way!

273
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,660
What's going on?

274
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,960
Catherine... Catherine has already become a victim of the potato chip hunters.

275
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,700
Who did this?

276
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,410
From the look of things, there's no doubt that she met a potato chip hunter.

277
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,390
But, wait.

278
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,940
Who on earth would do such a thing when our bond was getting so strong?

279
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,910
I've made a huge mistake.

280
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,070
My plan was based on the fact that the six of us had formed

281
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,130
a bond and therefore could not take action against each other.

282
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,070
But...

283
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,370
what if it was their choice not to take action rather than being unable to take action?

284
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,450
What if being friends was all an act and there really was no bond?

285
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,500
What if it was all just a strategic move to get people to let their guard

286
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,010
down so their potato chip could be stolen?

287
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,610
Good job, Catherine!!

288
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,020
Hah!

289
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,590
Dammit! Even the injury was an act!

290
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,900
They were working together so that while one was distracting me,

291
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,820
the other was aiming to take my potato chip.

292
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,440
You immature greenhorn!

293
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,330
You're a hundred years too early to try and trick us!

294
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,800
We haven't aged for nothing.

295
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,870
Sorry, but we're gonna take your potato chip.

296
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,540
What?!

297
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,580
These guys...with their controlled and calculated movements...

298
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,580
Don't tell me...

299
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,550
It was a double trap from the start?

300
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,900
The bait was Kagura, not the potato chip.

301
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,540
She made us believe we won and let us take the potato chip

302
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,280
so we would let our guard down,

303
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,810
and pretended to be shaken up by the whole thing?

304
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,270
The most dangerous moment in hunting is the moment you've captured your prey.

305
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,990
The bigger the prey, the more you let your guard down.

306
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,510
Go read HUNTER x HUNTER, volume 3, before you try and take us on, old hags.

307
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,490
Kagura-chan! Take the potato chip to a safe place while we hold them down.

308
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,110
We'll meet at the place we discussed earlier. We're counting on you!

309
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,710
Leave it to-

310
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,370
This is...!

311
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,530
Natto?

312
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,890
From the look of things, we expected the three of you to team up.

313
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,910
You didn't think...

314
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,910
...that we wouldn't try to get a third person to join us too?

315
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,870
Dammit.

316
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,250
You're slow! Kyubei Yagyu.

317
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,760
I hear you are a master swordsman with lightning fast skills,

318
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,290
but with that heavy body of yours, there is no way you can win against...

319
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,010
a ninja like me!

320
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,000
Sorry.

321
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,290
In order to train my legs,

322
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,700
I always wear heavy weights on my body.

323
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,790
Because of that...

324
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,810
I didn't grow tall but...

325
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,580
Sh-She's skinny!!

326
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,270
So all along, her body was...

327
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,090
...just padded with weights for training?

328
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,560
Then why on earth did she come to this fasting dojo?

329
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,570
To stay with Tae-chan...

330
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,320
You've all been completely fooled.

331
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,910
It was all a disguise to deceive you.

332
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,150
Training your body at all times.

333
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,070
Not only that, disguising yourself to deceive the enemy...

334
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,510
I expect no less from a Yagyu... But...

335
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,890
If it's body training...

336
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,560
Then I'm not about to lose to you.

337
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,980
Her glasses...

338
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,960
Don't tell me those were weights too?

339
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,090
Th-That's ridiculous.

340
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,110
It sounds like something straight out of Dragon Ball.

341
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,510
I've never seen this before.

342
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,910
As a ninja, if we lose to others in agility...

343
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,570
...then it's all over for us.

344
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,570
It's over!

345
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,100
Where did you pick up garbage like that?

346
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,460
Hey, that's my banana. Give it back to me.

347
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,760
It's yours?

348
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,880
Why do you have a half-peeled banana on you?

349
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,440
Were you secretly eating it?

350
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,060
From a Freudian perspective, a banana represents the male organ.

351
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,450
Most likely, Kyu-chan yearns to be a man and so unconsciously

352
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,730
has taken the banana and...

353
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,930
Spare us the psychoanalysis.

354
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,480
In any case, I cannot afford to lose.

355
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,760
I'll stop the enemy's movements.

356
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,170
And while I do that...

357
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,900
You get the potato chips back.

358
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,800
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,550
Put on your glasses!

360
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,620
Please! Aim at the enemy!

361
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,110
It's so sticky...so sticky...

362
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,110
Damn...you...

363
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,210
The potato chip!

364
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,310
Hand over the potato chip.

365
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,750
You're not gonna make anyone happy by losing weight.

366
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,320
Yeah, you're one to talk! You "beep"!

367
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,190
This is the worst!

368
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,010
All the potato chips are here!

369
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,670
They're so close, yet so far!

370
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,370
Damn it!

371
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,670
I'm not gonna lose!

372
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,850
The potato chips are mine!

373
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,180
I'm gonna be slim...have a beautiful body!

374
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,180
I'll show you a woman's pride!

375
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,920
Even I could see how bad my acting was.

376
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,770
That's right, this is a trap.

377
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,530
My lethal weapon of only pretending to want the potato chip

378
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,660
so I could draw the others to my chip.

379
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,930
My lightly salted potato chip isn't just any old lightly salted chip.

380
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,260
Even I was impressed with my acting skills.

381
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,920
My sour cream and onion isn't just any old sour cream and onion.

382
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,700
I was really nervous people could see right through me.

383
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,310
My Italian basil isn't just any old Italian basil.

384
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,160
I have a hell of a lot more experience than these young gals.

385
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,760
My spicy hot chip isn't just any old spicy hot chip.

386
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,060
I wanted Gin-san to give me a good spanking.

387
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,130
My soy sauce butter chip wasn't just any old soy sauce butter chip.

388
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,590
...seaweed salt...seaweed salt.

389
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,110
Eat it if you want.

390
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,040
In my lightly salted...

391
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,490
In my sour cream and onion...

392
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,290
In my Italian basil...

393
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,690
In my spicy hot...

394
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,090
In my soy sauce butter...

395
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,530
In my seaweed salt...

396
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,970
...is a powerful laxative!!

397
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,900
Eat it and you'll be shot up to the heavens!

398
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,620
The fashionable Italian basil for me.

399
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,400
Spicy hot for me.

400
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
Soy sauce butter for me.

401
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,060
Seaweed salt for me.

402
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,560
Lightly salted for me.

403
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,680
I'll try the sour cream and onion one.

404
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,900
The long awaited taste of potato chips... Chew it well...

405
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,880
Go to hell!

406
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,150
I tell you. This is the easiest business ever.

407
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,250
This fasting training camp or whatever you want to call it.

408
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,420
We collect the participation fee and our only expense is five or six bags of potato chips.

409
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,860
The money keeps rolling in.

410
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,420
And to top it off, they even take care of the chores around the temple.

411
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,830
So how did it go this time?

412
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,030
How many people survived after how many days?

413
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,330
Well, that's the thing...

414
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,230
Amazingly, we had people who completed the training for the first time.

415
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,180
Huh? You serious?

416
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,710
And not only that, there were six of them.

417
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,110
Really? I guess where there's a will there's a way.

418
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,480
The next episode...

419
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,840
"Be a Person Who Can See People's Strong Points and Not Their Weak Points."

420
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,320
[The man called "Turtle" has a well thought out plan and an invisible cloak.]

421
00:24:34,320 --> 02:19:22,000
[He feeds only when his prey appears. His profession is a sniper who can kill with a single shot.]
