00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,840
The singer Tsu Terakado.

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,870
When she was an amateur, she played
live performances on the streets.

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,030
She made her pro debut when she
caught the eye of a talent scout.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,190
Soon after, she was wrapped up in a
scandal and her popularity declined.

9
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,600
For a while, there were rumors
she was going to retire.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,680
But she made a miraculous comeback
under the production of Tsunpo,

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,770
[Note: Tsunpo is a parody of Tsunku, a Japanese
record producer, songwriter, and vocalist.]

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,770
a mysterious hit-maker who never
revels himself to the media.

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,950
She is truly a first-rate pop
idol in name and in reality.

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,500
We covered her closely as she
composed her new song.

Today, I have a very important
announcement, Mas Oyama!!

has been set, Tamba black beans!!

[Q: What do you think about the announcement
of her new single?]

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,810
Well, this is the first time I've been excited
since her last single came out.

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm definitely going to buy it.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,670
I think it's important to know
whether it's edible or not.

36
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,360
Well, I might be a bit hesitant
to buy it if they end up

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,030
releasing several different versions
of the single like they do

[Q: What is Article 7 of the Fan Club Regulations?]

44
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,880
Owowowow. "Members are to buy
four of each of Otsu's CDs:

one for storing, one for looking
at, one for propagating,

He's an amazing guy.

105
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,270
His bold, yet delicate, skills keep
others from getting near him and

106
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,910
puts him in a strong positing
to keep climbing to fame.

107

He sells and still causes
a stir on the scene.

her, Otsu's been a gold-record artist.

111
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,510

he'd sprain his finger.

your first new song, Otsu-chan.

But I don't have anyone who
can take Tsunpo's place...

really sold, anyway...

121

Realistically speaking, when
am I going to get an album,

I don't remember raising
her to be like that.

about postponing the release
of her new song.

137

I'll manage by myself!!

138
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,700
I'm still somewhat of a musician.

139
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,320
I wrote my own songs before Tsunpo-san
became my songwriter,

140
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,600
I should be able to make an amazing
song that's as good as his.

[Three Hours Later]

143
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,510
I can't write anything!!

144
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,630
Why? Is it because I
made some money?

145
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,440
Or is it because I don't
have a clear goal?

146
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,810
Is it because I lack concentration?

147
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,920
Is it because I'm hungry?

148
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,730
Is it because I can't remember
what I ate yesterday?

149
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,380
Is it because I haven't been in an episode in a while and
I can't remember the last time I was in one?

150
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,370
Or is it because...my talent's dried up?

No! No!

152

for Arnold Schwarzenegger.]

Also, Terminator 2 was also good. I cried
when Schwa-chan was sinking.

Sensei, don't start us off
by making us look bad.

“You can only get carried away until 2.”

Macaulay Culkin-kun got carried
away in 2 as if it were 3.

“What do you think? My face
is sickening, isn't it?”

376
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,500
When child actors get carried away, sometimes
number 2 gets turned into a 3.

This will be on the test. Don't be tricked.

Wait!! Then what about Dragon Quest 3?

379
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,990
I thought 3 was a masterpiece.

380
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,310
In 3, Ortega was like, “I fell
into a volcano. So what?”

381
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,000
“What do you think? I showed up, didn't
I?” It's been upgraded to 4. It's not 3.

382
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,120
Sensei, Ortega isn't a child
actor. He's an old man.

383
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,390
From Zoman’s point of view, Baramos
and Ortega are child actors.
