00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,730
Good evening.

3
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,110
I'm Gintoki Sakata.

4
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,210
I'm Shinpachi Shimura.

5
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,480
I'm Kagura.

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, I realize we just announced that the Gin Tama anime has been extended

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,130
for a fourth year on this program last month...

8
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,750
I'm sure some of you are already aware that the company producing this anime, Sunrise Inc.,

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,470
has suffered from the global economic crisis caused by last year's subprime lending problems in America,

10
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,580
and just a few days ago...

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,620
As a result, the company has decided that it is no longer feasible to produce this show.

12
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:24,610
And so, today will be the abrupt final episode of the Gin Tama anime.

13
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,630
[Gin Tama - Finale]

14
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,290
Uh, as mentioned at the beginning of the show, there has been a change in today's programming,

15
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,600
and we will be showing an emergency special program entitled "Looking Back at the Gin Tama Anime."

16
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:26,160
We deeply apologize for changing the program from the original listing in the TV guide.

17
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,650
Now that we suddenly find ourselves on the final episode...

18
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,910
How do you feel, Kagura-san?

19
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,820
When you look back at three years of the Gin Tama anime?

20
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,770
I feel pretty empty right now.

21
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,670
Everything seems so stupid.

22
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:53,410
Just last month, we were all excited about a having fourth year and how to buy time.

23
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,660
And after all that talk about not having budget,

24
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,260
and not caring about sales, look at us now.

25
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,070
Like a bunch of idiots.

26
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,600
I never expected it to end this way...

27
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,510
Kagura-san...

28
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,680
You're right.

29
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,960
We got carried away because of decent DVD sales.

30
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,040
When the decision was made to announce that we would be entering the final stage of the show,

31
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,740
there was a flood of phone calls and letters.

32
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,170
It was a circus at TV Tokyo and Sunrise.

33
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,210
The people in charge were like, "Man, it was hard to cope with that," and smiled,

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,380
but their eyes weren't smiling.

35
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,840
Well, it's too late to do anything.

36
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,440
I never expected Sunrise to end up like this.

37
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,540
Nobody could have predicted this.

38
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,080
We managed to survive low ratings, a new time slot, complaints,

39
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,760
and many other factors which threatened the end,

40
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,700
but this is how it goes when it's finally over.

41
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,440
That's right.

42
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,910
[Note: Space Battleship Yamato and Mobile Suit Gundam]

43
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,300
Famous series like "Space Ba*******" and "Mobile S***" were also cut short.

44
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,570
Yes.

45
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,860
And now we join those great works.

46
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,220
Let's be positive.

47
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,030
So here's the final episode.

48
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,850
We can't change what's already been settled.

49
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,310
There's no point in whining about it.

50
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:21,810
We will now show the original final episode that would have been shown at the end of the fourth year.

51
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,660
Please enjoy yourself.

52
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,800
And now we present the final episode of the Gin Tama anime.

53
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,770
["All's Well That Ends Well."]

54
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,390
Yo, Gintoki...

55
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,930
Our long relationship

56
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,570
ends here.

57
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,140
Takasugi, you bastard...

58
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,410
Allow me to end

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,140
the long nightmare you've been having.

60
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,680
Didn't I tell you, Gintoki?

61
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
I simply destroy.

62
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,630
...Everything!

63
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,500
Gin-san!

64
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,620
Afterwards, all kinds of things happened and everything was finally settled.

65
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,460
No matter what anyone else might say, things were settled.

66
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,060
And today is the day Shinpachi is leaving on his journey.

67
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,470
Shinpachi!

68
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,020
Kagura-chan.

69
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,730
Oh, she's finally here.

70
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,770
You're late, Kagura-chan.

71
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,030
Sorry about that.

72
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,230
I had to go buy this.

73
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,470
What is this?

74
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,770
Pickled seaweed.

75
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,980
They won't sell this where you're going.

76
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,010
Pickled seaweed...

77
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,520
Thanks, Kagura-chan!

78
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,710
Huh? Where's Gin-chan?

79
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,290
He's nowhere to be found.

80
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,060
Who knows what he's doing?

81
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,010
It's almost departure time.

82
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,100
That stupid Odd Jobs man picked a great day to go missing...

83
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,790
It's fine.

84
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,460
Gin-san already told me everything he has to say.

85
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,020
Yes, not using words...

86
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,970
But with his broad shoulders.

87
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,270
Gin-san...

88
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,350
I understood every single word you were trying to say.

89
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,280
Which is why I'll be able to move forward on my own.

90
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,730
Gin-san, I'm going now.

91
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,270
With the spirit of a samurai in my heart...

92
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,800
Gin-chan never showed up.

93
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,560
No, that's not true.

94
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Honestly, he never changes...

95
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,660
that guy...

96
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,890
Gin-san!

97
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,950
G-Gin-san...

98
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,970
Shinpachi!

99
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,100
These are the last words I have for you!

100
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,790
Shinpachi...

101
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,360
You're... a XXX.

102
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,550
Okay?

103
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,130
Gin-san...

104
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,570
I have no idea what you said.

105
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,760
[Fin]

106
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,220
Hey, wait!

107
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,020
What is this?!

108
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,680
What is this mess?!

109
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,360
Who's going to accept a final episode like this?!

110
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,310
Feels like they just glossed over the important stuff and dragged out the pointless stuff.

111
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,350
It can't be helped!

112
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,580
The original work's still running, so the anime can't make stuff up.

113
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,810
Grown-ups have their own circumstances to deal with.

114
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,600
Everybody, this is what you're going to get from the final episode of a show

115
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,360
based on something that's still running!

116
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't be so blunt about it!

117
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,050
Hey!

118
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,090
The final episode felt pretty good until we hit the commercial break,

119
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,310
so do a proper job of it!

120
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,070
Seriously.

121
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,800
Shinpachi had so much screen time it was pissing me off.

122
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,210
Wait, there wasn't anything wrong with that.

123
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,680
Fine, I get it.

124
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
We just have to redo it, right?

125
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,020
Then we'll start over from the top.

126
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,100
Take it away, big guy.

127
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,850
And now we present the final episode of the Gin Tama anime...

128
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,060
One more time...

129
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,180
Here we are.

130
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,060
["All's Well That Ends Well" - Alt]

131
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,700
Didn't I tell you, Gintoki?

132
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,830
I simply destroy.

133
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,350
Over and over again!

134
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Takasugi, you bastard!

135
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,220
Gin-san!

136
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,690
Why did this happen...?

137
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,870
Gin-san.

138
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,930
Kagura-chan!

139
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,100
Gin-san...

140
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,890
Kagura-chan.

141
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,430
Katsura-san, Elizabeth!

142
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,180
Okita-san! Hijikata-san! Kondo-san!

143
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,160
Hasegawa-san!

144
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,180
It can't be... It can't be...

145
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,390
Why...?

146
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,280
Why did this happen...?

147
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,430
This wasn't the end I wanted.

148
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,520
I just wanted to follow in my father's footsteps and restart his dojo.

149
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,190
I just wanted to become a strong samurai.

150
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,940
But you're the one who chose to follow Gin-san, Shin-chan.

151
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,680
To be a samurai, one must seek death.

152
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,570
You're regretting it now because you weren't ready to die.

153
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,470
You should just give up on that half-assed dream.

154
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,970
Nothing to say, so pass.

155
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,450
Shinpachi-kun.

156
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,970
As long as you're Otae-san's little brother, you're a strong samurai in my eyes.

157
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,440
A DORK like me has managed to survive this long.

158
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,880
Things will work out.

159
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,280
Don't worry.

160
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,600
After all these years, the audience has already forgotten about the dojo thing

161
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,810
and everything else that was part of your original background.

162
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,080
Is it really okay?

163
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,450
If I forget my original purpose, won't I just be a straight man with glasses?

164
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,990
You idiot! You're popular enough.

165
