Pen name "Catherine's cat ears are the worst-ever,
strongest-ever weapons" writes...

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,600
"What is "GinTama" trying to do?

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,630
I don't understand what they're doing.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,820
I don't see any kind of goal in this anime."

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,710
Okay, here's your answer.

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,190
I don't know, either.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,570
It's sad that after two-and-a-half years,

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,690
we're still getting postcards like this.

13
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,260
We shouldn't keep dragging
on and on. I mean really.

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,220
[Note: Parody of ONE PIECE.]

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,220
Maybe I should've said something like "I'm
going to become the Samurai King!"

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,390
So let's use that.

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,320
And so, "Catherine's cat ears are the
worst-ever, strongest-ever weapons,"

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,320
[Note: Gintoki is wearing Luffy's
costume from ONE PIECE.]

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,130
the goal of GinTama the anime is:
"to become the Samurai King!"

23
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,490
Look at the center of your screen.

24
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,730
Our camera is too far
away to see it clearly.

25
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,300
But you can see what
appears to be a cow

26
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,900
flying through the air as if it's
being sucked into the sky.

27

[Livestock farmer Zenshichi Toyobe (Age 72)]

28
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,140
I was working, when all of
a sudden, the sky lit up.

29
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,970
A glowing saucer came flying down,
sucked up my cow and flew off.

30
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,800
I hear Hikohachi over yonder
had all of his pigs taken, too.

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,880
Who could be doing such a thing?

32
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,240
The Bakufu suspects these to be
cases of theft by Amanto thieves

33
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,130
and is conducting an investigation.

34
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,270
Currently, the only damage has been
to livestock in farming villages,

35
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,810
but for anybody living in the city-we urge
you to lock your doors and be on the alert.

36
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,610
In other news...

37
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,610
How troubling. No telling where thieves
will strike from these days.

38
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,030
Cattle abduction in this
day and age isn't cool.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,930
A long time ago, before anyone
knew Amanto existed,

40
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,270
human beings were abducted and their
bodies altered against their will.

41
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,440
Because of incidents like that, people
talked about being "spirited away."

42
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,060
The problem was the victims had their
memories of the experience erased

43
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,200
so they can't remember
what was done to them.

44
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,610
But there were a rare few who did remember
and that's why we have these stories today.

45
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,700
There's no telling what
those bastards did.

46
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,970
For all you know, you may have
already been abducted

47
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,080
and had some strange thing
embedded in your body.

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,350
After all, you seem like an easy target.

49
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,480
Stop joking. I'm not a kid, so
you're not going to scare me.

50
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,850
Gin-san, the TV's acting up again.

51
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,760
This thing is hopeless...really.

52
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,380
That didn't fix it.
Maybe its time has come.

53
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,110
Guess we'll have to open it up to fix it.

54
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,750
Gin-san, if you're going to fix it,
I have a screwdriver...right here.

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,320
Want to use it?

56
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,790
W-Wh-What is t-th-this?!

57
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,330
W-Wh-Why is my finger
a Phillips screwdriver?!

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,170
C'mon Shinpachi, I know
your character is weak,

59
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,530
but that's not the way to go.

60
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,660
If you're going to upgrade your character,
at least give yourself a Psycho Gun.

61
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,660
[Note: From the anime Cobra.]

62
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,870
That's so half-assed.

63
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,180
That's not what happened!

64
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,350
Who'd do something like this
to upgrade their character?!

65
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,950
You saying you don't remember
doing that?

66
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,510
Of course not! Who would choose
to do such a thing?!

67
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,420
You're saying you have no
idea how it got there?

68
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,900
Did you get abducted?

69
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,750
Could...it be...

70
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,140
That wasn't a dream?

71
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,070
Tonight, I'm having Pacific
saury for dinner.

72
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,070
[Note: Pacific saury (mackerel
pike) is a type of fish.]

73

Nothing beats saury in the fall.

74

Wh...What is that?

75
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,110
It's...

76
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,450
so bright!

77
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,880
How's this one?

78
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,040
No good again.

79
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,310
The size is too big.
It doesn't fit the screw.

80
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,190
Good grief, now I can't fix my PS(P).

[Note: Short for PSP game Monster Hunter Portable.

82
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,920
The analog controller broke while
I was playing Mon-Hun.

83
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,870
I'm positive it'd be an easy
fix if I took it apart.

84
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,210
I don't think an amateur
should disassemble it.

[Note: Parody of Sony.]

86
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,850
Let's send it to Zony for repair.

87
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,810
I don't want someone taking my money.

88
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,620
But I heard if you disassemble it yourself,
they won't accept it for repair.

89
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,160
What? Seriously?

90
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,860
What'd you do with the warranty...

91
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,380
that came with it when you bought it?

92
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,590
I probably...

93
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,540
threw it out with the box, uh-oh...

94
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,580
W-Wh-What are you?!

95
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,350
Wh-What is this place?

96
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,720
Uh-oh, he's awake. It's because
you talk too loud.

97
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,750
That was you, Senpai.

98
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,230
What...did you do to my finger?!

99
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,670
We don't know anything about that.

100
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,350
What do you mean you don't know?!

101
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,960
You...it's...a Phillips screwdriver now!

102
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,150
It was like that from the start.

103
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,020
Don't lie! You did this!
You modified my body!

104
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,230
We didn't. I didn't want to.

105
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,580
Then Senpai said he wanted
to take apart the PS(P).

106
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,930
PS(P)?!

107
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,030
I told you not to say anything!

108
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,970
Hey, what do you mean by PS(P)?! Is that
the reason why you...?!

109
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,370
No, that's not it at all. We didn't
have the right screwdriver, so...

110
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,740
That's totally it!

111
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,740
You could've bought something
like that at any hardware shop.

112
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,650
Why did you have to modify my body?!

113
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,750
No, you misunderstand.
We had no time to lose...

114
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,780
After all, I knew you'd
try to get ahead of me

115
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,930
in Mon-Hun while I couldn't play.

116
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,920
You'd defeat Paoshanron all by yourself
to get an awesome item

117
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,920
[Note: Paoshanron is a Parody of Lao
Shan Lung from Monster Hunter.]

118
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,070
and give me the "I'm better
than you" Senpai look.

119
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,020
I wouldn't do that.

120
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,320
I'd never be able to defeat
Paoshanron by myself.

121
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,100
You told me that last time.

122
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,390
Then you defeated Purin alone
and got a nice item.

123
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,390
[Note: Parody of Kirin from Monster Hunter.]

124
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,240
Seriously unbelievable.

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,020
Who cares?! What're you going
to do about my finger?!

126
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,280
Return it to normal! I'll sue you!
I'll definitely file charges!

127
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,300
What should we do, Senpai?

128
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,020
I'll give up on the PS(P).

129
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,580
There's supposed to
be a new model out.

130
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,550
The one that's Net-enabled.
Let's play that one.

131
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,990
You're supposed to be able to
transfer your PS(P) data to it.

132
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,120
What'll we do about him?

133
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,780
Throw him out onto the road.

134
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,920
So you're saying they abducted
you to modify your finger

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,380
into a screwdriver just so they
could repair their PS(P)?

136
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,430
Hey, look at me.

137
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,860
It's not funny! How am I supposed
to live with a finger like this?

138
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,080
I can't pick my nose or
hug the person I love!

139
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,770
You'll be fine.

140
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,850
You'll be able to tighten the screws
to the heart of the person you love.

141
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,510
That's just lousy smooth talk.

142
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,950
What do you mean "screws
to the heart"?

143
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,220
Forget it. You have ten fingers.

144
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,940
I'm sure it's more convenient that
one of them is a screwdriver.

145
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,860
I've got to pee.

146
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,930
Don't say irresponsible things because
it's someone else's problem!

147
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,980
'Morning.

148
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,270
Oh, Kagura-chan, look what
happened to my finger...

149
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,940
I had a weird dream and
didn't sleep very well.

150
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,460
Gin-san! It's Kagura-chan!

151
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,850
Kagura-chan's entire body's been
turned into a flathead screwdriver!

152
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,960
C'mon! Are you listening?! Gin-san?

153
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,790

Unfortunately, the information we have
on them is extremely limited.

We don't know what planet those Amanto
are from, or where they are now.

All we know is that they're
obsessed with Mon-Hun.

and trace it back to them.

for Mongolian hamster?

Monkey Hunter, a.k.a. Mon-Hun.

168
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,500
It's a game where the player enjoys
being a hunter on a planet inhabited

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,480
by many types of monster monkeys.

if we conduct our search inside the game,
we're bound to meet up with them.

We don't have any other clues,

Gin-san, you're too loud.

195
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,070
And what's worse, they changed
it into a kind of screwdriver

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,260
I've never seen before!
What is that? Huh?

197

It's probably a hex socket screwdriver.

198

Where am I supposed to use this?!

199

I have no idea!

They could've at least made
it a Phillips or a flathead!

Your stick never had any use, anyway.

It would've been better if it had
corroded and fallen off.

never understand

This is a game where you hunt monkeys!

It's not a game where
hunters hunt hunters!

First-rate hunters aren't picky
about their targets.

How're we going to gather information
about the alien gamers?

324
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,660
And we're out in a field where

there's no telling when the

327

Do you understand? Now that the
game administrators are after us,

328

if we lose and the game ends even once,

we'll never be able to access
this game again.

Shut up. I know that.

bumping against my knees.

What's a Kaguura Jasuanto?

Are you serious?

337
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,390
Sounds like a name a middle-schooler
would think of.

338
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,020
That's totally the failure pattern

339

of a novice sending in their entry
to a manga competition.

340
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,090
You know, the way they over-think
things to the point where

341
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,120
the readers can't remember
the name of the characters.

Come on, both you-stop it.

346
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,910
Anyway, since we can't go back to town,

347
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,470
we have no choice but to
keep moving forward.

348
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,040
We'll keep hunting to the very end.

349
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,780
Hunt?

350
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,720
That's right. This is a game where the
players enjoy hunting the enemy.

351
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,300
If we go to a high-level area, we'll
find equally high-level hunters.

352
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,560
In other words, we'll be able
to meet all kinds of people

353

who've played this game
for tons of hours.

354
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,360
We're bound to find hunters who
know about the alien Gamers.

355

Hey, aren't you the one who said
we're done for if the game ends?

356
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,800
Then we should become allies
with the hunters we meet.

357
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,110
We'll get information, and kill
two birds with one stone.

358
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,120
And if all goes well, we might even
bump into the alien Gamers.

359
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,430
Yes! We should start by making allies.

Excuse me. We're novices at this game.

need to get past him?

took from the security squad!

monkey and get him to eat it,

It was a trap.

It's not a trap for you! It's a
trap meant for the beast!

have with bananas?!

That's why he can't write
the titles in a straight line.
