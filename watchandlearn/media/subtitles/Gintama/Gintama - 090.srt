Someone said...

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,120
...that even if your life is worthless, it'll eventually bring good luck.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,820
But that's just a lie.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,900
I'm a totally useless old man,

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,270
and I've never heard of a god who would bestow charity on someone like me.

Until today, that is.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,980
What a seedy bar...

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,790
There're so many shabby customers here that are just like me.

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,630
This place is a real dunghill, but...

12
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,170
...there is a goddess...

[Note: Spoof of Sin City and the actress Jessica Alba who played the dancer.]

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,970
Jessica... It sounds like the name of a goddess.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,630
It looks like my luck is changing.

17
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,860
Nope, I'm totally wrong.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,860
You don't have any money and yet you walk into this bar?! What a loser!

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,910
Get out of here, you bastard!

How true is it, "There's one law for the rich, and another for the poor."

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,720

Hey, hey, hey, hey! Where did you get these?

27
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,500
Did you go to Ryugujo, old lady? Your face does look like a prune.

I'm going to kill you, mop head! My friend gave these to me.

The fridge broke, so they all went bad. Please help us throw them out.

31
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,600
I wish I could help eat them. What a waste.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,020
Hey, you! Don't even think about eating these.

33
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,400
You'll get food poisoning from eating rotten crabs.

34
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,020
Stop saying things like that.

35
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,820
Even someone like me wouldn't stoop to eating rotten food.

36
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,260
When crab rots, it can't be eaten. But when a samurai rots, it's still a samurai.

37
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,890
Remember that, old lady.

38
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,980
Yeah, yeah... Just get rid of it.

39
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,400
Ow...

40
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,390
My stomach is spinning!

41
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,730
That's why I told them not to eat it.

42
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,860
They're so stupid...

43
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,400
Hurry up and go see a doctor, too, stupid.

But I don't know where the lowest point is.

Anyway, I only remember the bad things.

To all the patients, she's like an angel.

65

For me, it's like a dream that she's taking care of me like this.

That's good for you, Hasegawa-san. Now you won't feel lonely staying at the hospital.

85
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,890
That's not it, Uchino-san. We both just have rotten luck.

86
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,750
Hey, hey. We're a little sensitive to the word "rotten." So, please don't say it.

87
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,880
But I guess you're really out of luck.

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,760
You were run over by a car driven by a mysterious man?

89
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,340
It's rare to encounter a mystery man in civilized society.

90
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,730
Hey, why are you eating all my get-well gifts as if it was yours?

91
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,150
Hasegawa-san, you're a living reminder that there are worse things than food poisoning.

92
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,300
Thank you, Banana Old Man.

93
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,110
No, no. It's not "Banana Old Man." It's "Old Man's Banana."

94
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,400
You're eating right after getting food poisoning? You guys must be really healthy.

95
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,410
Hasegawa-san, you should eat a lot and get well soon!

96
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,080
Why is a healthy person like you eating it, too?!

97
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,980
Well, I have to get back to work.

98
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,100
Please be nice to each other.

99
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,920
Ouch!

100
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,290
...Gin-san, nurses are really amazing, aren't they?

101
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,580
For example, take a woman who's a 7...

102
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,600
Put her in a nurse's uniform and she becomes a 10.

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,140
Really? Then if I wear a nurse's uniform, I'll be awesome. What would my score be?

104
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,050
A 3!

105
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,480
Hey, what does that mean?

106
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,370
But then I'd have to start from zero. Is it starting from zero? Hey!

107
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,310
But something's strange...

108
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,330
Huh?

109
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,740
...about Uchino-san...

110
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,590
She always was a klutz, but she's really out of her head these days.

111
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,830
She's not the kind of girl who'd eat someone else's banana.

112
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,150
What? You're still pissed off about bananas?

113
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,700
Are you a reincarnated chimpanzee, you idiot?!

114
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,570
I'm not talking about bananas! I'm just worried there's something wrong with her!

115
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,400
Speak of the devil...

116
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,970
What is she doing? Why is her face all red?

117
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,420
It looks like she's staring into that patient's room...

118
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,790
Ah-ha!

119
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,600
Hasegawa-san, she looks to be sick, but not physically sick.

120
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,410
Hey, hey... Don't tell me...

121
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,330
Look, they're all old farts. There's no way she's lovesick for them.

122
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,690
She's got a daddy complex. Daddy complex.

123
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,220
Looking at wrinkled ball sacks made her remember her dead father.

124
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
Why ball sacks?! You could've just said "wrinkly face"!

125
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,810
You just like to say "ball sacks"!

126
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,090
...Huh? Whoa! Wh-What's that?! There's something weird over there.

127
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,650
Huh? That is...

128
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,580
Zu...

129
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,810
...Zura?!

130
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,560
Hey, that's not very nice, you know...

131
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,590
...Spying on me from behind... Well, it can't be helped if you've already found out.

132
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,960
That's right... I'm in love...with him...

133
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,780
I don't even know anything about him. He's not even my patient.

134
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,720
But when we passed each other in the hallway...

135
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:08,970
He had these intense and beautiful eyes... I can't stop thinking about him...

136
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,900
Hey, Uchee, I hate to say it, but that guy's trouble.

137
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,040
He doesn't look it, but he's a wanted-

138
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,980
I don't care!

139
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,450
That's all right... I kind of understood...

140
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,890
that he's someone I shouldn't get close to. He's from another world...

141
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,970
And I won't be able to see him again, anyway...

142
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:39,710
As it is... I don't know him very well... Just as a beautiful memory...I'll keep in my heart.

143
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,680
You're satisfied with that?

144
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,830
Talking it out makes me feel a lot better. Thank you.

145
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,850
It looks like Katsura-san is here just to look after Elizabeth-san.

146
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,700
Elizabeth was also run over by a mysterious old geezer.

147
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,660
Really? There're so many mysterious old men around that no one's mysterious anymore.

148
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,610
They're just ordinary old men!

149
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,460
That's not going to work at all. Ah, I know! Let's just call him "Na-san" for short.

150
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,460
[Note: Nazo means "mysterious." Thus Na-san.]

151
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,070
I really don't care.

152
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,670
Gin-san, you're a friend of Katsura-san, right? Can't you do something?

153
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,030
Huh? You trying to play cupid?

154
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,330

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,120
Anyway, we can't see ourselves! What does this mean?

310
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,680
D-D-Don't tell me that you're naked...right now, Kagura!

311
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
But I can't see you either, Gin-chan.

312
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,740
What?! Oh, it's true! This is really bad.

313
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,900
Even if we're like father and daughter,

314
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,350
a young man and girl naked under one roof is...

315
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,160
I'm not a little girl anymore.

316
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,290
No! Where's your common sense?! Don't say something like that!

317
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,680
Sadaharu! He's invisible, too!

318
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,040
Ow... Huh? I'm wearing my clothes.

319
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,310
Even my clothes are invisible. What's really going on?

320
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,410
I'm completely naked.

321
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:14,830
What?!

322
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,440
Just kidding.

323
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,270
Don't make fun of adults!

324
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,540
Ouch! You're so mean, Gin-chan.

325
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,190
But I can't believe even Sadaharu is invisible.

326
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,850
Ow, ow, ow! He's biting me! Biting! Sadaharu is biting me!

327
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,950
Gin-san!

328
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,120
Oh, it's Shinpachi!

329
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,260
We have a problem!

330
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,490
Gin-san, we have a problem!

331
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,050
Ouch...

332
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,350
Shinpachi?! Don't tell me you're invisible, too.

333
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,130
Everyone in Edo has turned invisible.

334
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,790
But the strange thing is, even their clothes and glasses are invisible.

335
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,970
I'm completely naked.

336
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,410
What?!

337
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,030
Just kidding.

338
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,070
I already told you, stop it.

339
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,890
Ouch!

340
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,330
Anyway, we have to find the cause...

341
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,270
Ow, ow, ow! He's biting me! Biting! Sadaharu is biting me!

342
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,460
Sadaharu, stop it!

343
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,670
Ouch! Kagura, that's not Sadaharu.

344
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,830
Sadaharu, no!

345
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,620
Ouch! Kagura-chan, that's me!

346
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,560
Hey, Sadaharu!

347
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,390
Ow! Kagura-chan, you knew all along and you're doing it on purpose?

348
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,660
Of course not!

349
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,340
Ow!

350
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,640
Anyway, regardless of what we're doing here,

351
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,690
the people watching us on TV can only see the background.

352
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,790
What the hell is going on?!
