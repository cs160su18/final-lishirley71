00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,860
His head's empty, but he loves ships more than anyone.

163
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,490
He's traveled all across the Milky Way.

164
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,120
To Tatsuma Sakamoto, flying a ship is like moving his own arms and legs.

165
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,690
Okay, all set.

166
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,170
Let's do it!

167
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,640
You're right. His head is empty.

168
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,110
Hey! Want me to whack you again?

169
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,910
This is the first time I've had to pilot a ship this big.

170
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,290
I have no idea where to start...

171
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,510
Where's the ship's wheel?

172
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,070
Gin-chan, is this it?

173
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,990
That's certainly not it!

174
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,650
Let go of the pilot's head! Sorry, mister pilot.

175
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,650
Hey, this isn't good. We're about to crash into a planet!

176
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,840
Gin-san, here it is!

177
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,160
Huh? It won't budge.

178
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,700
Well done, son. Leave the rest to me.

179
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,800
Don't come near me!

180
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,120
Weren't you supposed to love ships?

181
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,400
You're totally seasick!

182
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,810
I love ships, but riding in them makes me puke.

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,200
What a complicated love-hate relationship!

184
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,040
Shinpachi, never mind, let me do it!

185
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,950
I wrote an essay in school about how my dream is to become a pilot.

186
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,820
You stay out of this. Forget it. I'll do it. This is just like driving a mo-ped, right?

187
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,960
No! There's no way I'd leave my life in your hands, even if I had nine lives.

188
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,090
Hey, hey... Amateurs shouldn't be touching the controls.

189
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,510
I can see how this is gonna turn out.

190
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,120
The three of you fighting over the wheel is gonna make it break off.

191
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,870
I've got to prevent that!

192
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,460
So this is how it turns out!

193
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,300
It's not funny!

194
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,880
I've made up my mind!

195
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,710
I'm going into space.

196
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,030
If I stay on Earth, crawling around and fighting the Amanto,

197
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,660
I know how the future's going to turn out.

198
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,220
Even as we speak, the Amanto keep coming and coming.

199
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,750
We can't fight the tide of change.

200
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,440
Fighting this war is only sending our comrades to their deaths.

201
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,300
I don't want to see any more of our comrades die.

202
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,460
From now on, we've got to look at things from a different perspective.

203
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,760
A perspective so high, we can see humans, Amanto, and the whole world at once.

204
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,790
That's why I'm going into space.

205
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,700
I'll sail huge ships through outer space...and fish for stars.

206
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,620
How 'bout it, Gintoki?

207
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,960
You're much too good to stay cooped up on this tiny planet.

208
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,580
Come with me...

209
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,190
Hey, heaven, send a meteor crashing down on this guy's head.

210
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,110
I better watch out.

211
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,850
It's so hot, images of the past flashed by like a revolving lantern.

212
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,110
At least we managed to survive.

213
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,600
Survive?

214
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,940
How is this "surviving"?

215
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,360
We crash-landed on a planet whose entire surface looks like an old lady's wrinkled butt.

216
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,160
And It's all because you broke the wheel back there.

217
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,480
Hey, I've already forgotten the past.

218
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,040
Men need only look forward...

219
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,620
Don't play dumb, you hairball!

220
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,250
Oh come on, it's hot, stop shouting.

221
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,280
Kagura-chan, are you all right?
The sun is really strong here.

222
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,400
I'm okay. I have my umbrella, so I'm fine.

223
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,570
But my throat is dry,

224
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,150
I think I'll go drink some water at that river there.

225
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,710
River? No, wait! Don't cross over to the other side!

226
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,250
Daddy, give me a break.

227
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,500
I don't care about boxing anymore.

228
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,350
I just want a drink of water.

229
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,950
Who's your daddy?!

230
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,190
Gin-san, she's not well! Kagura-chan's about to cross the River Styx!

231
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,190
Joe, let me off the hook. I'm just an udon guy.

232
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,780
Guess I have no choice...

233
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,670
Pull yourself together, Kagura.

234
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,680
All right, Daddy. I'll box to the finish.

235
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,470
This isn't good. Her eyes are glassy.

236
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,680
I'll let her drink at that river over there.

237
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,710
You see it, too?!

238
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,800
What're you saying? You guys can't see it?

239
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,230
There's even a flower garden.

240
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,790
Oh, it's Oryo-chan. Marry me.

241
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,950
Are all of you hopeless?!

242
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,800
What's that?

243
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,310
It's a ship!

244
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,520
They've come to rescue us!

245
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,100
We're saved!

246
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Thanks, Mutsu! You came all this way to get me.

247
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,930
And it'll be the last time I do.

248
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,820
Our ships are for merchant business.

249
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,660
We can't have you, our leader, always getting into trouble.

250
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,260
And, this better be the last time you go wandering off without telling us.

251
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,220
Forgive me. I love Earth women best, after all.

252
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,160
I hope your balls rot off and you die.

253
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,010
I'm no match for a Hachikin like you, Mutsu.

254
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,980
Sakamoto-san, what are these?

255
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,330
Well...

256
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,680
They're the "Kaientai" fleet I put together.

257
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,670
But they're not for battles.

258
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,780
This fleet is my company.

259
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,090
Company?

260
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,790
That's right. We use these ships to engage in big business.

261
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,470
We travel to numerous planets, buying and selling merchandise.

262
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,790
In other words, we're traders.

263
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,130
But recently, space has gotten dangerous,

264
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,000
so as a self-protective measure, we've armed ourselves with these.

265
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,440
Sakamoto-san, so you're not such a loser after all.

266
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,310
"Loser"? Can l go cry now?

267
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,430
It's not military might and ideology that motivates people...it's profit!

268
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,320
Our business profits both humans and Amanto.

269
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,280
It helps ease tensions between the two.

270
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,140
I'm trying to protect our country with my own methods.

271
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,910
That's impressive.

272
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,420
Our boss is always so wrapped up in himself.

273
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,560
He's harder to pin down than me.

274
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,880
But a man who attracts people to him possesses something special.

275
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,270
You too, were drawn to something he has inside. Isn't that right?

276
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,260
I'm not sure what it is about him...

277
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,400
But...

278
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,580
Huh? What? What the? I don't believe it.

279
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,600
I think the heat has finally gotten to me. I'm seeing strange things.

280
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,760
Sakamoto-san!

281
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,390
Never mind. Never mind. It's just a hallucination.

282
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,300
Uh...but, uh...

283
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,500
It's okay. Let it be.

284
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,210
It's a hallucination.

285
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,500
Sakamoto-san!

286
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,080
What is that?!

287
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,170
A monster!

288
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,750
What in heaven's name is that?

289
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,570
That's a Sand Bug.

290
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,460
It's at the top of the food chain in this planet's ecosystem.

291
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,110
It's usually docile. It must have woken up from all that commotion we made.

292
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,410
What? Now just a minute!

293
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,560
How can you be so calm when your boss is in mortal danger?

294
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,870
This is what he gets for always going off and doing things on his own.

295
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,020
Sand Bug! Give that mop-head a good beat down!

296
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,440
Pay special attention to his jewels!

297
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,980
What? What have you got against him?

298
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,630
I'm not going to die here!

299
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,380
Everybody get away!

300
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,530
H-Here it comes!

301
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,450
It's trying to drag the whole ship down into the sand!

302
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,310
What?!

303
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,310
The cannons! Send it a greeting with the cannons!

304
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,800
If we do that, Sakamoto-san, you'll be killed, too!

305
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,890
Don't worry about me!

306
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,400
B-But Sakamoto-san!

307
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,980
Ready cannons!

308
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,200
Ready cannons!

309
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,330
Ready cannons!

310
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,240
Do you want to kill Sakamoto-san? He's your boss!

311
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,660
Never lose sight of your duty.

312
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,020
We can't endanger the passengers just to save him.

313
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,070
Right now, my duty is to save the lives of the passengers.

314
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,080
He always said, "Never lose sight of your duty."

315
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,960
He's a man who left the Anti-Foreigner war and his comrades behind and headed into space.

316
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,150
Do you know why he was able to do that?

317
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,500
Duty.

318
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,580
He always looked to the future...beyond the battle in front of him.

319
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,290
And he made the tough decision to labor for the good of his country.

320
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,170
We gathered together, drawn by his vision.

321
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,560
That's why, even now, I cannot flout his principles.

322
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,440
Cannons are ready!

323
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,800
Fire!

324
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,120
Plus, he's not the kind of guy who'd die from of something like this.

325
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,900
No, no, no! I'm telling you, he's going to die.

326
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,320
No matter how you think about it, he's going to die!

327
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,060
The Sand Bug is escaping under the sand!

328
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,070
No! Sakamoto-san is going to be...!

329
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,690
Kill it before it burrows under!

330
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,070
Save Sakamoto-san!

331
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,980
It's burrowing because you scared it with all that shooting.

332
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,790
Before you "Do Your Duty"... Remember your manners...

333
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,910
Gin-san!

334
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,480
Look who's talking!

335
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,810
Tatsuma! You spun a good story about saving the planet, but is this where it ends?

336
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,460
Were you just all talk? Look at me.

337
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,770
I'm living my life on my own terms!

338
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,990
I see...

339
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,520
I thought if you were with me, star fishing would be fun...

340
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,870
Sorry about that.

341
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,480
I may not show it all the time, but I like Earth.

342
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,270
Go off to space or anywhere you want and stir things up.

343
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,190
Fishing for small fries doesn't suit you.

344
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,490
Get a humongous net, cast it into space and snag a whole planet.

345
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,020
What're you going to do now?

346
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,730
Me? Well, let's see...

347
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,060
I'll take it easy and cast my net right here.

348
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:35,070
Maybe I'll catch a shooting star or something... Then release it into the sky.

349
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,510
Yeah, that's what he said...

350
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,980
Who knows what goes on in that guy's head.

351
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,690
But it's because you stayed that I was able to journey into space.

352
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:58,050
You stayed on Earth, so I could move forward without looking back.

353
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,600
Thank you...

354
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,520
Gintoki...

355
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,680
If you fish me up...every time I fall to the ground...

356
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,940
I'll keep on flying

357
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,720
...into the stars!

358
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,850
It's Sakamoto-san!

359
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,930
Sakamoto-san is alive!

360
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,860
That was reckless.

361
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,490
He was almost swallowed up himself.

362
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,600
What was that man thinking?

363
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,590
You said it. What were those two thinking?

364
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,050
What were they thinking? They weren't thinking at all.

365
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,410
But...

366
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,070
is there something that only they can see...?

367
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:36,790

Good evening, I'm Pako.

I'm working at a place called the Girly Boy Club.

Please come in, everyone.

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,050
Why am I doing this?!

Zura, you too?!
