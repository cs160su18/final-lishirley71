[You've enjoyed "Tuesday E-Jump."
But we've come to the final episode.]

3
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,080
[So today, we'll show you a great time until the very end.]

4
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,920
Don't give me that!

5
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,850
Do you have any idea what a nuisance your barbarism has become?!

6
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,660
Shut up, you old hag!

7
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,620
Where do you get off talking to me like this

8
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,020
just because I was late with the neighborhood notice?!

9
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,630
Kabukicho is a place where the pure and the dirty are mixed together.

10
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,350
That's all the more reason why you have to live according to the rules!

11
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,000
That's what you say, granny,

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,770
but just last week you put out JUMP comics on burnable trash day!

13
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,960
Not me! That was the guy on the second floor!

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,630
You're making too much noise...

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,630
Don't play dumb!

16
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,960
Don't get carried away because they call you the Empress of Kabukicho!

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,900
Hey, keep it quiet, you two freaks.

18
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,810
Do you have any idea what time it is?

19
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,080
You're raising my blood pressure.

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,170
Shut up, loser!!

21
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,120
Decent human beings have already started their day at this hour!

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,590
You guys think you're "human beings"?
Maybe you were a long time ago.

23
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,350
You're going to pay for even thinking you can defy me.

24
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,030
I'm taking him with me.

25
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,390
Go right ahead.

26
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,330
Shinpachi. Who is that monster?

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,510
Like Otose-san, she's one of the Four Royals of Kabukicho...

28
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,050
The Demoness Mademoiselle Saigo.

["Cute Faces Are Always Hiding Something"]

30
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,920
Girls, we have someone new for today.

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,760
Meet Pako-chan.

32
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,810
Oh my, she's cute.

33
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,150
Why's she called Pako?

34
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,860
Because she's got naturally wavy hair.

35
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,740
Give me a break, Mama. She's going to steal all of my customers.

36
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,430
I'm sorry, I have a stomach ache so I'll be leaving early.

37
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,690
You can't escape that easily.

38
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,230
I'll teach you what it means to survive in Kabukicho.

39
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,720
I already know. I live here.

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll teach you the noble way of those you call "freaks."

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Really, give me a break. I'm the main character, you know.

42
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,860
Pound into our new girl how tough it is in this business.

43
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,040
What're you doing, Zura?

44
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,230
It's not Zura. I'm Zurako.

45
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,320
Pops, isn't our tempura soba ready yet?

46
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,380
It'll be just a little longer.

47
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,010
A little? Do you know how many instant cup noodles I could've made by now?

48
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,750
Calm down, Elizabeth.

49
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,720
Recently the crackdown on lawless ronin has gotten stricter.

50
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,190
Don't do anything that would attract attention to us.

51
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,600
Here you go!

52
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,490
Damn you! Did you forget that we ordered before that guy?!

53
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,980
Please forgive me, mister samurai. This is a special customer...

54
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,110
It's your duty to treat...

55
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,020
each customer equally!

56
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,220
Prepare to meet your maker!

57
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,550
Oh come now, mister. Don't get upset over something like this.

58
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,560
Here, you can have mine.

59
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,420
Shut up, freak!

60
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,670
Hey. Who're you calling a freak?

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,570
And that's how I ended up here.

62
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,140
Since then, I've been looking for a chance to escape, but...

63
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,210
Hey, you! Sway your hips more.

64
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,560
Zura, you've been here too long.

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,210
You might not be able to return to the streets.

66
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,350
Don't be ridiculous. I have a duty to save my country!

67
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,320
I don't have time to waste fooling around here.

68
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,860
I don't want my country saved by a guy who dances to the beat of a place like this.

69
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,810
Hey, you two.

70
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,050
Zurako, Pako, you're rhythm is off.

71
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,230
Keep dancing like that, and you'll make your customers sick!

72
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,700
What're you talking about? This languid look is my selling point, Agomi.

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,970
Who're you calling Agomi?

74
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,740
Pako, I told you when I introduced you. This is Agoyo.

75
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,450
No, I'm not! It's Azumi. You idiots!

76
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,160
Come on! Pako, Zurako! If you can't dance, then help out in the hall!

77
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,860
Good day, I'm Vaneko.

78
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,350
I'm Wakame.

79
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,820
Pako.

80
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,600
Zurako.

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,270
Hey, hey, what's with those faces?

82
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,080
Does this place intend to make me drunk with those faces?

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,500
That's harsh!

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,950
I'm so shocked...

85
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,460
Hey, you with the naturally wavy hair.

86
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,770
I came here to laugh at weirdoes like you!

87
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,680
Do something funny, you freaks!

88
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,630
What'd you say, bar code head?

89
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,190
Want me to pull out every last hair of hope on your head?

90
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,710
Stop it, Pako.

91
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,590
Sir, I told you touching or insulting the hostesses was forbidden.

92
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,960
Don't try to make fools out of us!!

93
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,220
"More noble than a woman,"

94
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,000
"Stronger than a man..."

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,850
That's Mama's favorite phrase.

96
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,270
People like us need that kind of pride to survive in this world.

97
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,240
We have to be stronger than anyone or anything.

98
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,360
So are you strong, Agomi?

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,600
Can that chin of yours break anything?

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,250
Why're you limiting her strength to her chin?

101
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,420
But Mademoiselle Saigo's strength is extraordinary.

102
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,360
He's no ordinary man.

103
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,790
Yes, I hear he used to be amazing back in the day.

104
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,500
What was he called...?

105
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,530
"White Loincloth Saigo"... or something like that.

106
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,030
I don't know what he did, but he was some kind of hero who went into battle wearing a white loincloth.

107
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,570
With only that information, he just sounds like a pervert.

108
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,850
White Loincloth Saigo... I've heard that name somewhere before...

109
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,250
Come on and fight!

110
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,360
Your dad's a guy, but he acts like a mom!

111
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,250
Maybe you're a girly boy, too!

112
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,460
That's why he's such a weakling!

113
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,060
Infectious homo liquid!

114
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,700
Run!

Are you all right, kid?

Teruhiko!

118
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,620
What happened?!

119
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,810
You're hurt!

120
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,720
The hospital! We have to get you to a hospital right away!

121

Call Dr. Red Beard! Dr. Red Beard!

122
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,310
There are lots of Blue Beards around here.

123
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,950
I'm not talking to you jackasses! Beat it!

124
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,350
They're just scratches, so I'm okay, Dad...

125
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,220
I'm not Dad! Call me Mom!!

126
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,360
Teruhiko, you've been coming home a lot lately all bruised up.

127
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,790
What've you been doing? Are you hiding something?

128
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,940
D-Don't worry, Mom. I've just been playing samurai...

129
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,670
with my friends on the way home.

130
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,310
Well, I'm going out to play.

131
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,710
Just a minute!

132
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,840
Teruhiko!

133
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,800
Kid.

134
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,160
You forgot something.

[To all parents: Notice to Parent for Third Annual Visiting Day]

136
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,530
Don't worry. I haven't shown it to your father.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,340
Should I have?

138
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,160
No... Thanks, auntie.

139
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,780
It's not "auntie." It's Katsura.

140
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,190
Are you sure it's okay?

141
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,980
If your father doesn't come?

142
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,420
I want him to come, but...

143
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,340
You don't want to be teased again?

144
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,090
I don't care about that. I'm used to it.

145
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,090
But... I don't want to see Dad get laughed at or...hurt.

146
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,660
I love my Dad.

147
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,410
He's fun and can sometimes be a little scary, but...

148
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,940
Sometimes, I wish Dad was just a normal dad.

[Closed Till Tonight]

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,350
Mama, you've had too much to drink!

151
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,460
What's eating you, all of a sudden?

152
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,160
Leave her alone.

153
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,520
A man drinks until he's wasted, then he can finally sleep.

154
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,500
Don't you mean "woman"?!

155
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,260
A woman cries until she cries herself to sleep!

156
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,180
Really, Mama, you should stop. Mama and Pako both.

157
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,040
I really feel terrible for that boy.

158
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,040
With a father like this, you know...

159
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,940
It would be strange if they didn't pick on him.

160
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,280
So...you do understand?

161
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,350
That makes this easier...

162
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,080
Well, now you look like one of those anti-social types.

163
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,140
You need to look more like a hopeless father.

164
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,090
Shall I draw a turd on your forehead?

165
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,150
What're doing, you...

166
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,990
Teruhiko's mother died before he was old enough to remember.

167
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,510
From then on, I had to be his mother.

168
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,830
I went too far, and ended up like this.

169
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,290
For that boy's sake, I stuck to my principles.

170
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:39,080
I've never once regretted my decision, and I don't intend to start now.

171
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,320
Sure, there will be those who laugh at my ugly mug, but my spirit...

172
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,490
is more beautiful than any man's or woman's.

173
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
Yo, so you came.

174
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,640
Weak little girly.

175
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,590
Stop saying that! I'm not weak!

176
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,310
And I'll prove it.

177
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,910
Gintoki, I'm going back, after all.

178
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,510
Huh? You sure you're awake?

179
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,370
I'm worried about that father and son.

180
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,550
If you stay here any longer, you'll really turn into one of them.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,080
That freak drunk himself to sleep, so this is our only chance.

182
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,380
You can escape anytime, but now is not the time.

183
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,100
Good luck, Zurako.

184
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,070
I'll be praying that you don't spend half of your life away here.

185
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,270
Wait, Pako.

186
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,380
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

187
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,690
You're going to rip me in two! Into two new pieces!

188
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,220
What is it with you?! Just do what you want by yourself!

189
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,870
What're you saying, Pako?

190
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,180
Haven't we always fought together as the top tag-team?

191
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,290
Hell if I know!

192
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,550
The food was bad, but we ate at Saigo-dono's table.

193
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,560
Isn't it the proper samurai way to return kindness?

194
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,600
You're saying samurai should get involved in a kid's fight?

195
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,040
He's in danger!, What are we gonna do, Yo-chan?

196
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,070
I don't care! It was his idea!

197
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,840
Ow-ow-ow.

198
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,810
What're you doing? Lemme go!

199
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,790
You guys are gross!

200
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,440
Zurako, he says you're gross.

201
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,050
What're you talking about? He meant you, Pako.

202
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,070
He meant you Mr. bleached white face. Play more outdoors.

203
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,740
What about you? Your face just shouts, "I'm poor!"

204
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,690
"Give me back the lunch money you stole."

205
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,570
Just so you know, it's not our fault.

206
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,200
We tried to stop him, but he did it on his own...

207
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,330
I don't get it. Tell us the details. The details, or I'll shave your head.

208
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,170
It was a test of courage.

209
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,460
There's a test of courage that's popular among us kids.

210
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,940
When we teased him about it, he took it seriously and...

211
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,780
An abandoned house?

212
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,230
It's not an abandoned house. It's in there.

213
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,160
The other day, we heard a creepy growl... Like it was from a beast.

214
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,040
There's definitely something in there.

215
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,160
A haunted house, eh?

216
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,000
Hey, Zura, you're pretty good.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,410
How'd you make through such a narrow opening?

218
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,140
Huh? This isn't happening. You can't be serious? No way!

219
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
What're you doing...?

220
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,390
I can't move forwards or backwards.

221
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,080
You dumb blonde, that's why they named you Pako.

222
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,110
What was that, you bastard? I'll "Pa" you!

223
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,720
Come on, relax.

224
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,850
Ow-ow-ow.

225
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,940
It's no use. Leave me here. I'll live here from now on!

226
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,790
It's in here... Something mysterious...

227
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,000
Teruhiko-kun?

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,470
You're Teruhiko-kun, aren't you?

229
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,170
Please say you're Teruhiko-kun!

230
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,100
You bastard! You'd just leave me here?!

231
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,730
You said you wanted to live there.

232
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,860
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

233
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,250
I'll buy you a castella cake. Castella!

234
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,320
What would I use a castella cake for?!

235
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,510
Zurako!

236
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,110
Haven't we always fought together as the top tag-team, up until now?

237
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,650
Whatever!

238
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,160
I know! That's it!

239
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,690
I'll give you my leather jacket with "Samurai" printed on the back.

240
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,530
It's what you always wanted!

241
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,510
Who'd wear a tacky jacket like that?!

242
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,220
What're you humans doing?

243
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,170
Oh I see...

244
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,720
So a child came in here and hasn't returned since, you say.

245
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,390
And you came here to find him?

246
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,060
Recently we've had a lot of kids coming into the yard and causing mischief.

247
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,660
See that tree by the annex?

248
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,450
Kids claim that if they can fetch fruit from that tree, it proves they are a real samurai.

249
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,420
It's just like children think up such silly things.

250
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,970
So does this yard belong to you, Squirt?

251
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,430
Who the hell are you calling "squirt"?

252
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,000
Do you have any idea who this squirt is?

253
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,350
Stop it, Jii.

254
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,160
Father said that although we come from different planets,

255
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,400
we should always be kind to beautiful women. Have you forgotten that?

256
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,040
Prince, you mustn't be fooled.

257
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,720
After all your father said, he married a homely woman in the end.

258
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,460
Hey! That's my mother you're talking about! My mother!

259
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,450
Huh? You...

260
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,240
You... Have we met before?

261
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,020
Heavens no! How sick. Is that the Jomon pickup line?

262
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,570
You'll never pick up any Edo women that way, baldy.

263
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,330
Why don't you just croak.

264
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,740
I see... I thought we met somewhere before, but...

265
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,820
I can't ignore a damsel in distress.

266
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,580
How about we assist them in their search? Eh, Jii?

267
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,150
Um, I'll pass. I have a gate-ball match at 4 o'clock.

268
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,580
Old fart. I'll send you through the gate of Hell.

269
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,360
Prince, there's something I'd like to ask you.

270
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,760
There's a rumor going around the children that a monster lives here.

271
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,380
Any idea what that might be?

272
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,340
What was that? That growl?!

273
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,670
Something's coming. This time... Something's coming!

274
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,830
Pochi, show me some love.

275
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,080
Is this your monster?

276
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,480
Pochi is not a monster.

277
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,060
You're in the yard I prepared for my pet, Pochi.

278
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,480
I bought this abandoned samurai mansion, and turned it into Pochi's playground.

279
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,370
You don't have to worry. Pochi wouldn't hurt a child. Right, Pochi?

280
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,170
Excuse me... May I pet him, too?

281
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,640
Hey, don't.

282
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,450
Good boy, good boy...

283
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,010
What're you afraid of?

284
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,340
He certainly has a big body, but such a lovable animal wouldn't hurt anyone.

285
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,770
It's an angel. An angel.

286
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,440
Hey! It's an angel and a devil rolled into one!

287
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,050
An angel and devil dancing cheek to cheek!!

288
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,890
Pochi is an unusual species I found on a remote planet.

289
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,200
The bottom part is fake, right?

290
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,470
Animals lured in by cute faces get eaten by the main part. What a fabulous organism!

291
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,930
And we're in exactly that situation, aren't we?

292
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,170
It's fine. Pochi only eats salami. Right, precious?

293
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,110
He's, you know... Just playing. Seriously.

294
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,220
No way! He just ate your head nub thingy!

295
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,770
I'm fine, I tell you. This will grow back.

296
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,090
Look out! This isn't funny!

297
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,400
Yo-chan, this doesn't sound good. It's going to get those people, too.

298
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,090
Yeah...

299
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,700
Yo-chan! Where're you going? Yo-chan!

300
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,800
...Aunties! Hang in there, Aunties!

301
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,370
Hey... You okay, kid?

302
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,490
You really had us worried. Are you hurt?

303
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,280
I could as you the same question!

304
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,340
Zura, you really are in sorry shape. Where'd you put your body?

305
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,570
You're just an exposed head yourself. Namu Amida Butsu.

306
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,320
Shinpachi! Kagura! Sadaharu! Farewell!

307
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Calm down. The two of you have just been buried, that's all.

308
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,160
I see.

309
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,450
There's nothing to worry about anymore. We've come to save you.

310
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,950
Or should I say, please save us.

311
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,720
Why did you come here, aunties?

312
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,270
Never mind that. We're glad you're safe.

313
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,200
Yeah. I was hiding up in a tree the whole time.

314
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,010
I didn't dare come down. Then I saw you being carried off by that thing.

315
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,790
That Pochi, he learned a new trick. How sweet.

316
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:28,020
Prince, Pochi does this when he wants to store his food.

317
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,130
What're you going to do about this, you idiot prince?!

318
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,320
My life and my gate-ball match are over!

319
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,970
Shut up, you old fart!

320
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,170
If we get out of this, I'm definitely firing you!

321
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,430
Go right ahead.

322
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,980
We're all going to die here anyway.

323
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,320
I'm sorry, everybody. It's my fault this happened...

324
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,680
What have I done?

325
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,550
I've caused so much trouble for everyone...

326
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,250
I wanted to somehow prove that I wasn't weak.

327
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,120
But...

328
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,970
I was so angry that everyone made fun of Dad.

329
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,550
Dad is the way he is, but I know that he has a spirit that's stronger and purer than anyone.

330
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,530
But no one sees that. They don't even try.

331
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,750
It makes me so angry...

332
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,660
I'm... so frustrated.

333
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,370
You...

334
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,100
He's coming...

335
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,840
Pochi, if you have to eat, then eat Jii!

336
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,130
I'm all fat and bad for your health!

337
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,190
What're you saying?!

338
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,310
If you eat me, my bones will stick in your throat for sure! Eat the prince!

339
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,940
Hey! Hey! He's coming this way!

340
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,920
That's enough! Forget about us and just run away!

341
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,660
You'll be killed, too! Hey! Are you listening?!

342
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,940
Shut up! I'm strong! I won't run away!

343
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,660
This is no time to say such things! Hurry!

344
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,750
Runnnn!!

345
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,430
You are strong...

346
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,830
We already knew that!

347
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,030
You and your dad are both men of strong spirit.

348
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,070
You think nobody can see that? Don't be stupid.

349
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,730
Those who can see that, see it.

350
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,230
At the very least, there are two right here who can see it. Remember that.

351
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,710
Auntie...

352
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,600
As if you would know.

353
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,230
M-Mom!

354
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,260
I remember now...

355
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,210
Back during the Amanto invasion,

356
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,830
there was a man who wore nothing but a white loincloth when he stormed the enemy battleship.

357
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,990
He fought until that white loincloth was stained crimson with the blood of the enemy.

358
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,030
His exploits are legend.

359
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,380
The Demon, Tokumori Saigo!

360
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,110
He's our great Senpai.

361
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,010
M-Mom... I'm sorry. I...

362
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,850
Idiot! Right now, call me Dad.

363
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,780
Hey.

364
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,210
You two are fired.

365
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,930
You still can't dance, no matter how much you practice.

366
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,210
If you ever call us freaks again, I won't go easy on you, you hear?!

367
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,760
And one other thing...

368
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,760
If you are ever feeling frisky, come visit the club for a good time.

369
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,790
We'll treat you real special.

370
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,430
He scares me.

371
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,160
Looks like we didn't need to worry.

372
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,180
They're no different than samurai. They have a path of their own to follow.

373
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,090
My Father-Mother.

374
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,690
My mother is my mother, but she's also my father.

375
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,060
Actually, she's my father, but she's my mother.

376
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,810
Mother has a lot of ladies around her,

377
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,300
who call themselves butterflies, but they're really more like moths.

378
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,090
But they're all good people.

379
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,840
I think their spirits are purer than anyone else's.

380
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,580
Mom, everyone. I hope you remain wonderful moths forever.

381
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,450
I love you all. The end.

382
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,820
I really should stop coming to Earth.

383
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:40,060
["Actually, you did want this leather jacket, didn't you?"]

384
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,060
["Hmph! I just accepted it for your sake."]

385
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:51,570
[Preview]

386
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,080
Gin-san, Gin-san!

387
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,450
Gin Tama's been renewed for a third season!

388
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,950
Really?

389
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,450
We have to celebrate!

390
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,080
Shall we splurge on sukiyaki, then?

391
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,920
The next episode: "A Shared Soup Pot is a Microcosm of Life."
