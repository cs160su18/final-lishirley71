The land of the samurai.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,520
There was a time, long ago, when our country was called by that name.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,580
With the arrival of the "Amanto" from outer space...

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,390
Can't we skip this intro already?

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,660
I'm getting really sick of it.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,430
Huh? But there might be people watching this for the first time.

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,830
Don't bother.

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,560
It's a world they wouldn't understand even if we explained it, anyway.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,680
They can follow along at their own pace.

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,300
Don't learn it, taste it.

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,880
What good is tasting it gonna do?!

13
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:00,030
[The Client: Taizo Hasegawa, Chief of Foreign Bureau Department. ]

[He's an important Ju-chin in the government. When we say Chin, we don't mean that kind of Chin.]

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,210
I am very sorry.

16
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,980
We looked everywhere, but we were unable to find him.

17
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,020
It appears he is no longer within these grounds.

18
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,850
Don't be ridiculous!

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,100
Chief!

20
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,090
"Not here" isn't good enough!

21
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,330
B-But...

22
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,900
I don't need your back talk.

23
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,940
You Edo officials just have to do our bidding!

24
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,540
Use whatever means necessary to find him!

25
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,150
You heard me-now get moving!

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,930
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,440
Chief!

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,690
We must prevent word of this from leaking to the upper echelons.

29
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,000
I know. I have a plan.

30
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,390
Hey there! You useless naturally wavy haired lout!

31
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,900
Today I'm making you pay every penny of the back rent you've piled up!

32
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,270
Yeah, I heard you, I heard you.

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,950
Guess I don't have a choice.

34
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,540
Here.

35
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,160
Adios.

36
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,190
Hey, what's with the 230 yen?

37
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,920
You're not buying JUMP, you know! Worthless punk!

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,160
I don't have it!

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,760
That's all I've got!

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,430
Try to understand at least that much, you clueless old bat!

41
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,720
If you don't have money, go swindle an old lady or two.

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,540
Ain'tcha got any balls, curly?

43
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,810
Always going on and on about petty things like money, money, money!

44
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,300
If you wanna be seduced, just say so, you starved slut!

45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,920
What?! If you want me, you should've said so from the start!

46
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,600
If you're tryin' to make me puke, I'd be happy to oblige you!

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,180
You want a flood of complaints from the very start of this episode, too?

48
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,180
Chief, that's the place.

49
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,790
Hmph! Look, I'll wait just one more day!

50
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,320
If you still can't pay, you're outta here. I'm serious!

51
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,190
Let's go.

52

["Responsible Owners Should Clean Up After Their Pets"]

53
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,870
What're you going to do?

54
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,230
She even took the 230 yen that you were going to spend on JUMP.

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,080
You'll be able to pay me this month's wages, won't you?

56
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,980
I'm counting on you. My household budget is already smelling bad as it is.

57
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,710
So is the breath of all those old guys packed onto the trains.

58
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,150
Shinpachi?

59
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,020
Yes?

60
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,950
You don't have a girlfriend, right?

61
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,780
What's with this, all of a sudden?

62
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,010
Interested in going out with an older woman?

63
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,980
Her name's Otose.

64
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,900
Who the hell would go out with her!

65
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,330
And what do you take a person's youth for?!

66
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,670
Don't get your panties bunched up.

67
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,560
Money doesn't come to guys who really want it.

68
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,000
It comes to people who appear cool, and cause mayhem.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,700
That would be you two!

70
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,680
Just you guys alone would make anyone's indecisiveness go away!

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,330
Huh? Tube's on the fritz.

72
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,510
Oh, it's coming in.

73
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,710
Ketsuno is on the scene. Ms. Ketsuno?

74
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,480
Yes, this is Ketsuno reporting from the scene.

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,490
It appears that the mysterious giant organism

76
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,240
that appeared at Oedo Hot Spa and destroyed facilities in the area,

77
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,330
over the course of several hours, has disappeared.

78
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,970
Hey, hey... Another alien got out of the terminal, eh?

79
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,820
Quite a few, recently.

80
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,720
More than the alien, the bigger problem is how are we going to make a living.

81
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,370
That old hag.

82
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,080
If it's about the money, I already told you I don't have any! You rotten hag!

83
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,880
Huh?

84
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,840
Chief!

85
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,340
Damn you! What do you think you're doing?!

86
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,840
Sorry about that. My mistake. I'll come back another time.

87
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,250
Hold it!

88
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,340
You're the Odd Jobs man, aren't you? Come with us.

89
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,780
Sorry. Mom told me not go with strangers.

90
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,710
Didn't you learn not to disobey the law?

91
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,220
You're...with the government?

92
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,510
We're with the Immigration Bureau.

93
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,810
We came to hire you for a job, Mr. Odd Jobs.

94
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,420
When you say Taizo Hasegawa of the Immigration Bureau,

95
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,290
you're talking about that big shot government official who oversees all Amanto immigration?

96
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
A big shot? Does that mean he has a big schlong?

97
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,720
A beastly one.

98
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,610
No, it means he's an important government official.

99
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,210
And Kagura, a girl shouldn't be saying such things.

100
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,140
At any rate, what does a government bigwig want with us?

101
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,560
What do you want, Mr. Big Schlong?

102
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,630
Odd Jobs, was it?

103
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,420
I heard there were people who would do anything if I piled on the money.

104
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,130
I've come to ask you to do a job.

105
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,730
A job? Are you guys doing yours?

106
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,460
Look around town. The Amanto are doing whatever they please.

107
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,700
That was harsh. We're doing all we can, you know.

108
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,110
After all, Edo's developed this far thanks to them, you know.

109
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,480
And plus, they seem to really like this place.

110
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,730
So we can't treat them badly now, can we?

111
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,760
And the Amanto already have their networks rooted in the heart of the government.

112
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,980
We have to stop dreaming that we can drive them off of the Earth.

113
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,680
All we can do is to try to coexist with them.

114
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,430
Hmm...coexist, eh?

115
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,810
And you enjoy doing that?

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,730
Well, never mind. So, what do you want us to do?

117
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,000
It's a job we can't move on very openly.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,320
If it becomes public, the government will lose face.

119
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,800
The fact is the government is in a diplomatic crisis

120
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,560
that could have a decisive influence on our country.

121
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,770
The prince of the Midland Star is staying here...

122
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,960
And the prince has a problem...

123
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,080
My pet, Pesu, has disappeared...

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,080
Might I ask you to collect him for me?

125
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,350
Hey! Hold on!

126
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,950
You guys do Odd Jobs right?! You'll do anything, right?

127
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,490
No, I know! I know, but take the job! Please!

128
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,070
Shut up or I'll break your shades, Baldy.

129
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,060
I'll yank off your beard, bastard!

130
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,550
Go ahead, call me baldy.

131
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,230
You can yank off my beard, too, but just take the job!

132
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,750
We're in a bind here.

133
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,410
The government borrowed quite a bit of money from his country.

134
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,000
What do we care? It's your problem.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,570
If the country's gonna collapse just because of a stupid a pet,

136
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,030
then it should go ahead and collapse.

137
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,660
What do you mean by "just a pet"?

138
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,580
Pesu is like family.

139
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,560
Then please look for it yourself. Prince Pinhead.

140
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,760
Hey! He's a pinhead, but he's still a prince. A prince!

141
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,980
Forget the one who leaves you, and prepare for a new love.

142
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,330
That's what a strong woman of today would do.

143
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,510
He wasn't jilted, and it wasn't a woman!

144
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,870
He's a pinhead, but he's a prince! He's a pinhead, but...

145
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,520
We understand. He's a pinhead, but he's a prince, right?

146
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,020
That's right. A pinhead, but a prince!

147
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,640
I get it. A pinhead, but a prince, eh?

148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,470
In other words, he's a pinhead prince?

149
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,030
No, he's a pinhead, but a prince.

150
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,860
You keep calling him a pinhead.

151
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,240
That's very disrespectful to the pinhead Prince!

152
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,130
You just called me a pinhead, as well.

153
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,450
Can't you handle a problem like that by yourselves?

154
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,190
Well... We have our reasons...

155
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,300
It'd be no problem for Mr. Odd Jobs, right?

156
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,400
No. We may be called Odd Jobs,

157
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,550
but we haven't lost sight of ourselves to the point where we would wag our tails for the government

158
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,290
and do their errands for them.

159
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,480
Let's go, Shinpachi. Kagura.

160
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,810
See ya, Big Schlong.

161
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,490
Just so you know, we intended to compensate you very generously.

162
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,930
So, what do we have to do?

163
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,330
Yes, Boss, we'll do anything you say!

164
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,030
That was quick! Let's mull this over a bit more!

165
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,130
What I want you to find is this octopus-like alien named Pesu.

166
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,520
It's probably wandering around the city.

167
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,500
Anyway, I want you to capture it alive and bring it back here today.

168
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,390
Just because Pesu is like an octopus, would it be in the harbor?

169
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,490
It doesn't matter. It can be anything.

170
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,150
All we need is one lead, and we can go from there.

171
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,990
It works at speed-dating parties.

172
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,040
Hey, octopus jars.

173
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,640
What if we set them in that area and wait?

174
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,600
Huh? Are you some teenager who can't confess his affections?

175
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,060
Waiting doesn't get you love or help you find an octopus.

176
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,440
Stop this useless talk. Let's go.

177
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:11,330
Hmm. I know a lot about sea octopuses, but I don't know anything about land octopuses.

178
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,770
Why not ask a shop that sells land octopuses?

179
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,380
I've seen many kinds of octopuses,

180
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,830
but never one that looks like this.

181
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,730
Hey, Sabu. Ever seen one that looks like this?

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,690
Yeah.

183
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,860
I think I saw a small one like that at the shop on the main street.

184
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,970
So, did you want something?

185
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,080
It's Pesu!

186
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,920
Close, but no cigar!

187
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,210
No, don't you think they look kinda similar here around the eyes?

188
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,350
Do you look like your father?

189
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,850
Maybe your mother?

190
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,540
No! She's a human being!

191
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,150
Are you people making fun of me?

192
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,520
Okay, I've got it. From today, you'll be Pesu.

193
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,630
Huh? I'm Vanessa!

194
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,210
Okay, from today, you'll be Pesu Vanessa.

195
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,350
Just plain Vanessa if fine!

196
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,100
Anyway, please come with us.

197
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,170
We're supposed to be looking for an alien octopus!

198
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,790
Alien octopus?

199
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,240
Huh? You know one?

200
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,130
Now that you mention it,

201
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,740
a girl who works here said that a stray octopus-alien was caught by the Humane Society.

202
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,560
That's...

203
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,150
Let's go, Shinpachi. Kagura.

204
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,830
Right.

205
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,240
See ya, Pesu look-a-like.

206
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,210
No, I'm Vanessa!

207
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,860
Gin, step on it or we won't catch up.

208
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,020
No worries. It's more fun to chase than be chased.

209
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,530
That's why young girls grow up to be adults by falling in love with love.

210
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,600
There!

211
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
Let's go!

212
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,460
Hey, w-wait!

213
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,490
Ow, ow, ow...

214
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,240
It's a squid.

215
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,640
Listen, this is just like going after a delicate young girl with a broken heart.

216
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,830
We mustn't chase after it too far.

217
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,500
The heart of a teen that runs away from home is also delicate.

218
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,810
Adults don't understand anything.

219
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,040
Gin?

220
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,530
After all the searching we did, we've come back to the octopus jars...

221
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,620
Octopuses like being in jars.

222
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,720
Normally, you have to die before they put you in a jar.

223
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,520
You're talking about urns for ashes.

224
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,510
Gin, I was trying to tell you about this idea right from the start.

225
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,310
It's just a tad different, I'd say.

226
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,860
If searching around doesn't work, we just wait patiently.

227
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,820
You just got tired of searching!

228
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,590
After running around all over the place, will this really work?

229
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,010
It'll work out. Well...er...uh... It will work out, right?

230
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,120
Do you know the meaning of the word "responsibility"?

231
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,770
Guys like you always end up getting dumped.

232
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,550
Don't worry.

233
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,010
Give them some sweet talk, and any woman or any octopus will come wagging their tail.

234
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,750
Women don't have tails.

235
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,970
Neither do octopuses.

236
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,300
You were the one who said that!

237
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,370
I don't believe it! He really fell for it!

238
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,920
Um...and who might you be?

239
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,850
Vanessa?

240
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,940
No, it's not! It's Pesu. Pesu!

241
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,550
Pesu?

242
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,970
Get him!

243
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,960
Stop, you!

244
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,310
Hey! Stop shaking!

245
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,410
You're not some young girl

246
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,340
scorned by her boyfriend and treated gently by another man, you know!

247
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,100
In that case, the second guy has all the advantages!

248
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,980
In this case, our priority is to chase after Pesu!

249
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,160
Now what?! We can't get out!

250
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,310
Fine! Let's just roll around like this.

251
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,780
Whoa, déjà vu!

252
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,190
He's fast! Pesu is fast! We'll never catch him like this!

253
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,090
Idiots! Once your feelings start to run, there's no stopping them.

254
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,020
If we don't catch him you get to date some rich old hag, Shinpachi, you fool!

255
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,270
Wives are passionate, stupid!

256
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,290
Why is this my fault?!

257
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,670
Look out!

258
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,970
Ouch!

259
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,970
We squished it!

260
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,210
Ch-Ch-Chill out and help me find a t-t-time machine.

261
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,980
You chill out! And that again?!

262
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,500
Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's what you asked for.

263
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,210
Oh...Pesu!

264
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,250
That thing is dead!

265
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,910
It's not even damage-free, the face has changed color!

266
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,140
It's all right. It's just at that age when it wants to wear makeup.

267
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,700
Happens a lot during adolescence.

268
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,590
All we did was flatten it with a jar and it turned out like this.

269
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,810
What a weakling!

270
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,540
Flattened it?! You did this?!

271
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,930
It's not dead yet! Just, barely alive.

272
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,930
"Just barely alive" is the problem!

273
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,740
Leaving aside the fact that it isn't unharmed...

274
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,170
We should be thankful the damage was not any worse than this.

275
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,350
Damage? What do you mean?

276
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,520
The seas on the planet where that thing came from are very warm.

277
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,530
Pouring hot water on it will return Pesu to its original size.

278
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,430
Hot water?

279
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,460
What're you doing?!

280
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,450
Boiled octopus, uh-huh!

281
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,060
Wh-wh-what are you thinking?!

282
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,940
Enjoying it in a delicious manner is the ultimate memorial service!

283
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,880
Oh, it's boiled just right.

284
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,660
Y-You idiot.

285
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,870
P-Pesu?!

286
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,010
No waaaay!

287
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,870
Didn't you hear what he just said?!

288
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,150
Pesu! Pesu's come back to life!

289
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,220
Yahoo!

290
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,650
I can eat my fill!

291
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,080
See, look! It's alive!

292
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,380
As if you had anything to be proud of!

293
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,920
Whoa.  It's pretty strong.

294
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,460
You never told us it would grow like that!

295
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,130
I didn't tell you, because you didn't ask!

296
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,050
Give me a second. I'll shut that punk up!

297
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,030
Hold on.

298
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,460
Don't do anything on your own.

299
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,070
Don't injure it more than you already have.

300
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,900
Oh, I remember now!

301
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,120
Is this that weird creature we saw going on a rampage on TV?!

302
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,990
How're we supposed to capture something like this?!

303
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,260
For that matter, how were you keeping it?!

304
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:54,040
Pesu is an unknown organism discovered on a remote planet.

305
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,390
He became attached to me, so I led him back to my ship!

306
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,500
He's not attached to you at all!

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,030
It must be low on calcium.

308
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,130
Oh no! It's headed for the city again!

309
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,610
Gin!

310
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,470
Oh brother.

311
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,230
Kagura, go buy some soy sauce.

312
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,320
We're having octopus sashimi for dinner tonight.

313
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,260
Gotcha. Soy sauce, it is! We're feasting tonight!

314
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,030
No, maybe takoyaki sounds better.

315
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,050
It's lunchtime!

316
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,230
Forget it!

317
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,200
Ow, ow, ow!

318
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,130
What was that for?! Is that my brain leaking out?

319
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,800
You mustn't hurt it! The prince told us to capture it unharmed!

320
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,290
Unharmed?! Is that even possible?

321
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,870
That's why I hired you! Now make it happen!

322
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,430
No way, no way. I'm telling you, no way!

323
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,380
Gin!

324
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,250
Shinpachi!

325
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,370
I told you not to hurt it!

326
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,160
Help! It's going to eat me!

327
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,170
Why you!

328
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,570
I knew perfectly well that capturing it unharmed was impossible.

329
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,660
That pinhead prince won't get the message until the body count goes up a bit.

330
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,970
Hey! Are you listening to me?!

331
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,260
So you're using my sidekick as pet food to get permission to kill that thing?

332
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,640
You guys are rotten to the core.

333
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,160
I told you.

334
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,020
We have no choice but to coexist with them.

335
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,980
Corrupt or not, I'm going to protect the country my way.

336
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,480
That's my bushido.

337
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,250
I see.

338
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,690
Then, I'm gonna follow my bushido, too!

339
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,000
Wait!

340
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,360
It's one human being versus a whole nation.

341
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,030
Think about which is more important!

342
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,110
I don't give a damn about that!

343
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,290
Shinpachi!

344
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,040
Hold on!

345
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,620
Hold on, he says.

346
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,440
Damn it!

347
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,320
It doesn't matter whether the government collapses or the nation collapses!

348
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,060
Until my body collapses, I will live my life standing tall!

349
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,060
Gin, your soy sauce!

350
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,110
Oh brother. That bastard's ruining everything!

351
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,160
Ohhh, Pesu! My precious Pesu!

352
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,110
It's like a fountain.

353
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
Hasegawa! What's the meaning of this?!

354
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,520
I told you to capture him unharmed!

355
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,600
How will you take responsibility for this? It's an international incident!

356
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,770
Hey! Are you listening, damn it?!

357
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,500
Live standing tall?

358
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,680
It's almost like the goals a kid sets in grade school.

359
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,610
Come to think of it, Mom always used to tell me.

360
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,530
You're slouching. Stand up straight.

361
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,400
And you enjoy doing that?

362
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:20,580
Mom...am...I...standing up straight right now?

363
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,990
...gawa...Hasegawa!

364
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,360
I'm going to tell my father about this, Hasegawa!

365
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,370
Shut up.

366
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,550
Shut up!

367
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,870
I said shut up you freakin' space flounder!

368
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,350
Was it all right to do that?

369
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,280
Good question, moron. This here is the land of the samurai.

370
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,990
I can't just let them do anything they please.

371
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,040
But you won't be able to police the Amanto anymore.

372
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,980
You'll be canned for sure.

373
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,590
Boy you're dumb.

374
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,390
People who act on sheer impulse always ruin their lives.

375
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:56,670
[Preview]

376
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,740
Gin, will you stop lying around and get up already?

377
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,080
Are you even motivated to do this show?

378
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,590
It's only been two months since the series started!

379
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,680
With the star of the show like this, we'll be cancelled before the end of the season!

380
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,780
The next episode: "There Is Butt A Fine Line Between Persistence And Stubbornness"

381
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,020
[Only two months into the show and the series' future is already in danger.]

382
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,030
[You think we should change the title character and start a show called "Shinsengumi Twenty-Four" next week?]

383
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,060
Hey, Gin?

384
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,220
Why is the title of this manga "Gin Tama"?

385
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,470
Because of the raunchy title, "Gin Tama,"

386
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,130
people have been complaining saying "we aren't allowed to buy the book."

387
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,530
From what I hear, it's part of the author's plot to make high-school girls throughout the country say things like,

388
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:38,660
"Hey, say, did you see this week's Gin Tama?"

389
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,890
He wanted to get it into the regular street talk.

390
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,740
Seems he failed miserably, though.

391
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,530
Well, that only seems right.

392
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,570
By the way, Kagura, what is that you've been eating?

393
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,360
Takoyaki!

394
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,070
[Pesu]

395
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,510
Yuck!
