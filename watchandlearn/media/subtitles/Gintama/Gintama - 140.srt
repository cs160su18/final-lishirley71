2
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,230
That's...

3
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,850
Th-That scar...

4
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,800
They enforce Yoshiwara's laws and punish all who resist. The Hyakka.

5
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,470
She's the leader, and the most powerful guard in Yoshiwara.

6
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,920
I am Tsukuyo.

7
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,940
Why?!

8
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,740
Why are we being attacked by the defense force?!

9
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,020
I-I don't know!

10
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,100
This isn't the time! Get Seita out of here now!

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,000
Shinpa-

12
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,170
My target...

13
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,910
is you!

14
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,330
Yo!

15
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,180
Gin...

16
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,710
Sorry for the wait.

17
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,960
U-Umm...

18
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,620
Excuse me, Gin-san.

19
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,180
You...

20
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,280
got...

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,150
stabbed.

22
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,860
By what?

23
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,000
Well...

24
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,620
You were definitely stabbed just now.

25
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,030
Are you alright?

26
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,650
What are you talking about?

27
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,430
I wasn't stabbed by anything.

28
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,340
See?

29
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,630
Well, you're...

30
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,080
You're covered in blood, so please don't push yourself.

31
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,750
Are you really alright?

32
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,490
I'm telling you I wasn't stabbed.

33
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,150
This is... you know...

34
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,740
I got grazed, and it bled a little.

35
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,920
I definitely wasn't stabbed.

36
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,180
No... but...

37
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,340
I'm telling you I wasn't stabbed!

38
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,560
Do you really want me to get stabbed that much?

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,530
Fine, I got it.

40
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,050
Then let's just say I was stabbed!

41
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,780
Even though I wasn't actually stabbed!

42
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,130
No, you really were stabbed.

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,740
Don't push your luck!

44
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,110
The one who was stabbed is saying he wasn't stabbed!

45
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,170
So let's just say I wasn't stabbed!

46
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,200
You just admitted it.

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,470
You know... you should... really...

48
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,550
read the situation around you.

49
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,990
Just let this one slip.

50
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,100
Just pretend I wasn't stabbed.

51
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,940
It'll make me look really bad.

52
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,270
I even posed like I had just deflected all the attacks.

53
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,860
This is totally embarrassing!

54
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,010
Damn...

55
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,480
I'm too embarrassed to even turn around.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,080
Are they laughing? Is everyone laughing at me? Is everything alright?

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,740
Yes, everything's alright.

58
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,770
You were able to strike down all of the shots in my attack, who are you?

59
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,690
She's trying to help me out!

60
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,050
She's pretending that I struck them all down!

61
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,780
She's a good kid! She's definitely a good kid!

62
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,640
Attack?

63
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,930
Sorry about that.

64
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,020
I thought those kunai were just taking a stroll.

65
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,040
How about it? Instead of these dangerous things,

66
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,500
how about I use something better to sta-

67
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,490
Oh damn...

68
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,790
She got my hand too!

69
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,340
They saw it! They must have seen it!

70
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,640
You didn't strike them all down at all!

71
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,450
You got stabbed all over the place!

72
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,120
This is bad. What should I do?

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,740
They're laughing at me. They're laughing at me, right?

74
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,960
That's it. I'm going home. I'm going to the hospital.

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,160
Please, just calm down.

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,630
It's embarrassing because you acted like you deflected everything.

77
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,050
Let's just pretend that you were using your body to shield Seita-kun.

78
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,870
I'm impressed that you would use your body to shield the kid.

79
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,120
Who are you?

80
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
She was listening to us!

81
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,480
She's going along with our plan!

82
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,070
She's a good kid! She really is a good kid!

83
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,840
Your attack was something else.

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,300
It took all my strength just to shield him.

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,030
Oi!

86
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,500
Are you alright, Seita?

87
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,830
Seita... kun...?

88
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,130
No way...

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,950
You're kidding!

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,370
S-Seita...

91
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,310
Seita!

92
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,490
Gin-san! This!

93
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,400
Look! He was totally stabbed!

94
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,740
You came here to save us, but he got stabbed anyway!

95
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,710
What the hell did you come here for?!

96
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,150
You bastards...

97
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,960
You bastards!

98
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,690
I hope you're all prepared to die!

99
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,110
He's blaming them! He's pretending to be angry so that he can blame them!

100
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,290
Umm...

101
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,970
Umm... Excuse me, I saw the whole thing.

102
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,340
Umm... Before, when that guy came to help,

103
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,590
one of the kunai that got deflected...

104
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,250
stabbed him.

105
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,280
Uh...

106
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,210
I saw it too.

107
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,160
Me too.

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,300
Me too.

109
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,970
If that kunai wasn't deflected, it wouldn't have hit him.

110
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,730
Then it's as if that man killed him.

111
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,620
Gin-san...?

112
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,030
Hey... Gin-san!

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,780
You bastards...

114
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,570
You bastards!

115
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,440
I hope you're all prepared to die!

116
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,220
He's pretending that whole conversation never happened and re-edited the scene!

117
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,290
You shall also fall prey to my kunai.

118
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,990
You will soon be joining the kid I killed.

119
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,410
She's trying to help me so much!

120
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,810
She's taking the blame all by herself!

121
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,770
She's a good person! She really is a good person!

122
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,120
Wait...

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,160
Please stop helping me.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,820
I'll feel like crying if you're this kind to me.

125
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,750
What the hell are you talking about?!

126
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm not helping you.

127
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,420
Had I not thrown those kunai, none of this would've happened.

128
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,050
Regardless of how it happened, ultimately, I started it.

129
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,930
I killed him.

130
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,310
Please stop. I understand how you feel, but I killed him.

131
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,060
Why are you two consoling each other?!  You're both enemies!

132
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,760
I said that I killed him.

133
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,520
No, it was me!

134
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,470
No, it was me!

135
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,070
It was me!

136
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,510
Me!

137
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,590
Me!

138
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,480
G-Gin-san!

139
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,450
I took care of all of them.

140
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,780
Go report to Housen-sama accordingly.

141
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,450
I'll clean up here.

142
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,050
Oi!

143
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,610
Get up.

144
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,340
If you don't move it,

145
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,350
I'm going to use a real kunai on you.

146
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,130
We're still alive?

147
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,270
There are people guarding the gate,

148
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,350
so you should escape through here.

149
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,870
It'll take you a day and a half, but you should eventually reach the surface.

150
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,740
Get out of here quickly!

151
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,980
If you come back again, I'll kill you for real.

152
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,880
You sent your subordinates away and put up an act to let us escape?

153
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,940
Why would you, the leader of the Hyakka, do that?

154
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,540
I am the guard of Yoshiwara.

155
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,390
I eliminate any problematic elements in Yoshiwara.

156
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,990
That is all.

157
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,650
Sorry, but we can't just disappear like this,

158
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,710
and we don't intend to let you kill us either.

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,790
I'm only here to meet my mother, to meet Hinowa. That's all!

160
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,700
Then I advise you to leave all the more.

161
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,460
The one who asked me to let you guys off is none other than...

162
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,170
Hinowa herself.

163
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,970
Mother did?

164
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,400
Mother knows about me? She knows that I'm here?

165
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,750
Housen, the owner of Yoshiwara, is afraid of letting you come into contact with Hinowa.

166
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,600
Stay here, and you will lose your life.

167
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,450
Why? What reason does he have to stop a mother and her son from meeting?

168
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,930
Because Hinowa may then try to escape from Yoshiwara.

169
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,710
Just like when she tried to escape with you when you were still a baby eight years ago.

170
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,790
With me...

171
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,730
Twenty years ago, due to the war between the samurai and the Amantos,

172
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,570
Yoshiwara was razed to the ground.

173
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,900
However, the Amanto were interested in its potential profit and colluded with the Bakufu

174
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,190
to secretly resurrect it underground,

175
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,150
creating the Yoshiwara Tougenkyou.

176
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,060
Because of its secret connections with the Central Administration,

177
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,910
it is ignored by the Bakufu and allowed to operate under its own jurisdiction.

178
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,200
Naturally, it became a place infested with the rich and powerful indulging themselves.

179
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,210
In other words, it is a breeding ground of corruption.

180
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,920
Any courtesan knows at least one or two of the country's most confidential secrets.

181
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,840
Because of this, the women who arrive are never allowed to see the Sun again.

182
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,510
Once they arrive here, they're treated like commercial entities.

183
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,350
They are bound to this cavern and are exploited until they become useless.

184
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,540
Those that are no longer of any value are just thrown away.

185
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,520
Those who try to escape are killed.

186
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,230
This place is not called the land of everlasting night...

187
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,590
solely due to its rotten reputation.

188
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,170
I only understood this once I was sold here.

189
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,290
For us, the dawn of hope will never arrive.

190
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,380
We can only live a life of endless despair in an everlasting night.

191
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:01,990
However...

192
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,000
in the depths of this despair,

193
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,970
amongst the women with lifeless eyes,

194
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,700
there was one woman...

195
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,160
who had a different feel to her.

196
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,890
You're the apprentice from Kamekichi's place, right?

197
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,350
Did you argue with that woman again?

198
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,010
She's a woman that loves to take out her anger on anyone around her.

199
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,460
I know you can't stand her,

200
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,720
but if you keep making her angry, you might die, you know!

201
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,740
Even children won't receive any mercy here.

202
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,670
You keep getting bullied because you always have that brazen look on your face.

203
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,550
You have an adorable face, give me a smile!

204
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,550
What is it that you couldn't stand?

205
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,350
Just let her kill me if she wants.

206
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,290
In this prison,

207
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,490
I'll end up a lifeless husk like the rest of you anyway.

208
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,590
Instead of ending up as some guy's merchandise,

209
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,570
I'd rather be killed.

210
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,220
Prison, eh?

211
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,290
You think you'd be free if you were above ground?

212
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,540
With your outlook, you would never be free no matter where you went.

213
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,920
After all, humans...

214
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,390
are locked in a prison known as Earth.

215
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,960
Whether you're above or below ground makes no difference.

216
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,280
It's just a question of wide or narrow.

217
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,890
People who feel that the prison is too narrow and can't take it...

218
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,560
will never be free.

219
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,810
Theirs would be a life just watching the cell bars.

220
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,520
In order to truly be caged,

221
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,650
you have to set up a prison inside your own heart.

222
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,150
If you have the energy to whine about dying or whatnot,

223
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,360
why not fight it out in this very cell,

224
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,240
against yourself, that is.

225
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,620
But if there's one less noisy monkey around,

226
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,790
you might end up realizing that this cell is pretty spacious.

227
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,630
That woman's eyes were not lifeless.

228
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,470
Oi, have you heard?

229
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,890
A fight broke out between two prostitutes in the streets!

230
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,510
Hinowa picked a fight with Kamekichi. She's beat up pretty badly!

231
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,350
Oh, scary!

232
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,810
What was it about this time?

233
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,190
What is it that pissed them off?

234
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,360
Hell if I know.

235
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,320
Who knows what goes on in those prostitutes' heads...

236
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,400
Wait.

237
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,240
If you bring food to the detention cell,

238
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,160
you'll get reprimanded too.

239
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,830
Don't be mistaken.

240
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,210
This is the stuff you left behind yesterday.

241
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,540
The rice balls that you made tasted so bad I couldn't eat it.

242
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,170
I'm just returning what belongs to you.

243
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,920
I'm not doing anything wrong.

244
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,970
Is that so?

245
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,890
I don't recall my rice balls being this good.

246
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,980
Can you come over and help feed them to me?

247
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,730
I can't use my hands.

248
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,860
Can I?

249
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,730
I don't mind.

250
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,070
Apprentices are supposed to serve courtesans anyway.

251
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,820
From today onwards, I'll be your big sister.

252
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,950
I was in the darkness of the everlasting night,

253
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,210
but I found a miniature sun.

254
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,250
Not just me,

255
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,920
it was the same for the other lifeless women.

256
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,960
When they saw her radiant smile,

257
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,420
they too naturally begin to smile.

258
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,640
Not long after, that small sun...

259
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,310
grew and eventually illuminated all of Yoshiwara.

260
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,720
That's right,

261
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,480
that is Hinowa.

262
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,820
I cut my face and gave up my right to live as a woman...

263
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,440
not because I disliked becoming a courtesan,

264
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,110
nor because I wanted to become a Hyakka to protect Yoshiwara.

265
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,120
It was to protect Hinowa.

266
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,530
And Seita...

267
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,660
You are the existence that Hinowa protected with her life.

268
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,000
Giving birth in Yoshiwara...

269
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,250
means that both mother and child are to be killed.

270
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,250
In spite of that, you were born unto this world.

271
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,920
If she escapes from Yoshiwara,

272
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,720
no matter where she runs to, she will be found and dealt with.

273
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,970
In spite of that, she still brought you up to the surface.

274
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,350
The child's not here.

275
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,650
Look's like the child's been handed over to someone else.

276
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,870
Kill me.

277
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,280
From the moment I held that child,

278
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,870
I've been mentally prepared.

279
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,130
It's unfortunate...

280
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,460
but I can't let you off the hook just yet.

281
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,010
You shall suffer in that hell until the day you die.

282
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,220
After all, you still have plenty of value to me.

283
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,390
I'm not joking around!

284
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,270
I shall be your puppet...

285
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,230
no longer!

286
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,320
You still don't get it?

287
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,860
Everything depends on you!

288
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,160
I'm willing to let a mere child go.

289
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:23,250
But... I'm also willing to search under the bridge and kill that old geezer and the kid.

290
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:24,880
Now...

291
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,460
what is it going to be?

292
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,220
Just as Hinowa illuminated the everlasting night for us,

293
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,270
To Hinowa... you are a special existence, Seita.

294
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,520
The Sun cannot shine without clear skies.

295
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,490
I cannot allow you to die here.

296
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,410
Go home.

297
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,320
If you die,

298
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,740
Hinowa's suffering will all have been in vain.

299
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,420
Oi, we really appreciate your concern,

300
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,960
but it looks like it's too late.

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,710
An umbrella?

302
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,260
Don't tell me...

303
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,840
That's...

304
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,190
T-That...

305
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,110
That umbrella is...

306
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,200
A Yato?

307
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,820
Why?

308
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,200
Why are there Yato clan members here?

309
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,120
Looks like the escape route you prepared for us...

310
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,330
is already under their control.

311
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,250
No...

312
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,000
He's not Housen's subordinate.

313
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,420
He's...

314
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,090
Hand the brat over.

315
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,630
Hand that brat over to me.

316
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,810
G-Gin-chan, this is bad.

317
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,930
That guy gives me a very bad feeling.

318
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,640
The stench of blood...

319
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,360
He's covered in the smell of the blood of countless people.

320
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,070
The smell of a true Yato.

321
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,400
Why is he here?

322
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,880
Hurry!

323
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,710
Nows your chance!

324
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,550
Run!

325
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,390
Tsukuyo-san!

326
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,680
From below?!

327
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,530
Gin-chan!

328
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,950
There are two Yato?!

329
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,870
Dammit! Let me go!

330
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,960
Seita!

331
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,210
Move.

332
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Get out of the way.

333
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,430
I already told you...

334
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,140
I don't give a damn...

335
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,100
about weaklings!

336
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,480
Bro-

337
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,690
Kagura!

338
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,960
Gin-san! Everybody!

339
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,670
I think we went overboard.

340
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,970
We're gonna get yelled at by that annoying geezer.

341
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,760
It's fine.

342
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,680
Master Housen holds the courtesans of higher value than this city.

343
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,890
If we bring him the kid, I'm sure he'll be in a better mood.

344
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,640
And besides,

345
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,980
if you don't go this far, she won't die.

346
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,860
Hmm? You know one of them?

347
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,280
No.

348
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,530
It's none of my business anymore.

349
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,930
Is everyone alright?

350
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,800
Kagura!

351
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,430
Hang in there! Oi, Kagura!

352
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,350
Seita-kun was taken by those guys...

353
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,350
Who were they?

354
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,480
Most likely, they're...

355
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,480
from Harusame.

356
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,950
Harusame?! You mean the Harusame space pirates?!

357
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,240
They're more than just drug traffickers.

358
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,780
We've fought them before!

359
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,280
During the Benizakura incident,

360
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,660
they cooperated with the Kiheitai against Katsura-san's group.

361
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,880
Although many of the prostitutes in Yoshiwara were sold off by their parents,

362
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,630
there are many more who end up in Yoshiwara as victims of human trafficking.

363
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,270
The Harusame space pirates have established their interest in this place since long ago.

364
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,270
No... it's much more than mere interest...

365
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,190
Yoshiwara's owner, Night King Housen,

366
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,360
was a former high-ranking official of Harusame.

367
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,530
Night King Housen.

368
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,240
He's called this...

369
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,280
not only because of his lordship over the land of everlasting night.

370
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,780
The clan forsaken by the Sun...

371
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,870
The ones who live in the shadows...

372
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,120
The one controlling them...

373
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,870
The one controlling the shadows...

374
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,460
The Night King Housen,

375
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,840
is the man who was once known as the King of the Yato.

376
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,170
The King of the Yato?!

377
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:12,220
Amongst the countless Yato warriors, the Night King was one of the most powerful.

378
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,690
He could even go up against the strongest assassin, Umibouzu.

379
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,520
Against that baldy.

380
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,820
Looks like we're messing with some kind of monster.

381
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,280
G-Gin-chan...

382
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,030
Kagura-chan!

383
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,250
The really dangerous one...

384
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,410
isn't him.

385
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,290
The baldy...

386
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,380
has a son.

387
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
He's my...

388
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,010
moron of a brother!

389
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,840
To be continued

390
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,440
A mutiny?

391
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,440
Kamui, you don't believe in hierarchies.

392
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,360
You only believe in the difference between the strong and the weak.

393
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,070
You would even bare your fangs against your master.
