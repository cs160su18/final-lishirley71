00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,480
What? Again?!

3
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,080
[Today's GinTama has two stories! The first story is about Sadaharu in hea...er, love.]

4
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,080
[The second story is about Katsura in hea...er, his delusions. "Drive With A "Might" Attitude."]

5
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,030
What's the matter, Sadaharu? Poop?

6
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,010
Good morning!

7
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,450
'Morning. That's a huge doggie.

["A Dog's Paws Smell Fragrant"]

9
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,620
He didn't finish eating again...

10
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,120
Gin-chan, Sadaharu has no appetite these days. He might be feeling ill.

11
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,740
Any dog that eats 5 bags of dog food in one sitting isn't feeling ill. He's just stupid.

12
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,430
He usually eats 7 bags.

13
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,630
Maybe he's exhausted from the heat? He does have fur on his face, you know.

14
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,940
Come to think of it, he's been looking at nothing but fashion magazines lately.

15
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,370
Maybe he's trying to change his look.

16
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,100
He does seem hot. Shall we give him a trim?

17
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,430
Then I'll do it. Sadaharu, I'll make you into a handsome stud!

18
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,900
He didn't finish eating again.

19
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,860
Gin-chan, Sadaharu still doesn't have an appetite. He must be feeling ill.

20
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,590
It's because you gave him a ridiculous cut. He's probably depressed.

21
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,620
That couldn't be. You look great, Sadaharu. A cool biz look.

22
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,140
I've never seen a dog with a cut that makes him look like a pro wrestler.

23
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,250
Come to think of it, Sadaharu's been looking at nothing but macho magazines lately.

24
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,400
Maybe he wants to build his body into a pro wrestler's.

25
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,290
He already looks rebuilt. By you, the mad scientist.

26
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,900
A pro wrestler, eh...

27
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,050
You don't have to do it.

28
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,500
How should we do it?

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,050
You don't have to anything.

30
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,060
He didn't finish again...

31
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,520
Gin-chan, it's no good.

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,360
You're the ones who're no good.

33
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,110
Why's a dog wearing a dog mask?!

34
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,600
It's as ridiculous as eating fried rice on top of fried rice!

35
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,190
It's not a dog! It's Wolf The Mask. His favorite technique is Poison Mist.

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,190
[Note: Based on Tiger Mask, a Japanese professional wrestling character used as a gimmick in manga in the 60's.]

37
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,370
Hey, hey, hey! There's the poison mist right now!

38
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,580
Shinpachi! Get some rags! Rags!

39
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,110
Yeah, okay.

40
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,850
Wolf The Mask, what's the matter? Cheer up...

41
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,610
It's no use. He's been interested in Hot Dog Press lately.

42
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,610
[Note: Magazine for young men. Articles include fashion and dating advice.]

43
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,920
The issue devoted to "Do it! Get That Girl!"

44
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,970
Hey, you think...

45
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,180
Oh, he's grown so big since I last saw him. How old is he now?

46
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,830
Two years old. He's so high maintenance.

47
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,300
I heard yours won at the recent dog show.

48
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,210
Oh no, that was just pure luck. Right, Betty-chan?

49
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,160
A monster!

50
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,080
You're creating a scene.

51
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,820
What is this? A matchmaking party for dogs?

52
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,280
House pets don't get many chances to meet other dogs.

53
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,320
It's like a social event for dogs.

54
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,520
Owners who want puppies find partners for their precious pets here.

55
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,530
Think there's a partner for our dog in heat?

56
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,810
Doesn't look like it...

57
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,640
But I'd like him to at least make a friend...

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,800
Looks like the dogs are being ignored.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,930
There are mostly dog owners who came to socialize-bragging about their pets and such.

60
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,110
Some people come here looking to meet the opposite sex.

61
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,350
Socialites fishing for lovers using their pets as bait, eh?

62
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,150
Can't tell who's here to find a mate.

63
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,120
Um...Ma'am.

64
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,350
It's not what you think!

65
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,370
We didn't...

66
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,220
It's not what you think! It's not that! I didn't come here with any ulterior motives!

67
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,130
We said we never...

68
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,610
It's not what you think! I was just a little lonely! Seriously!

69
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,190
It's not easy keeping a pet, so I bought a mechanical dog.

70
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,240
It's so cute, I felt like taking it out with me to show it off!

71
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,490
[Note: Hasegawa is dressed as Captain Harlock/Juzo Okita from Space Battleship Yamato.]

72
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,380
That's really all it is! Seriously! I had absolutely no sick intentions...

73
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,870
What's this piece of junk doing?!

74
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,330
Hey! Madao! Look! Sit!

75
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,970
Gin-san, machines have a soul, too.

76
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,600
He must've caught his owner's obsession.

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,590
How shallow. A pet is like family. Using it to pick up women...

78
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,760
He must be lonely after his wife left him.

79
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,910
Oh, look there.

80
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,410
Haven't I seen her somewhere before?

81
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,990
She's, you know, the weather lady on Wake Up TV. Announcer Ketsuno.

82
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,120
So she's a dog person, like us...

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,870
Excuse me, could you and I... I mean my dog and your dog do it?

84
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,060
Do it?

85
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,620
He easily used his pet as a tool! And with a pick-up line a caveman would use!

86
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,410
I uh...always watch you on TV. I'm a fan.

87
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,370
Oh, thank you very much.

88
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,540
Gin-chan, she's fatter than she looks on TV.

89
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,620
I'm so sorry. She's just excited. Just so hopeless...

90
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,880
That hurt! Gin-chan, you said so yourself---that she put on weight after her divorce!

91
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,770
That sure is a huge dog. What's his name?

92
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,320
Wolf The Mask.

93
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,640
Such a masculine and strange name. Can I call you Wolf-chan?

94
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,600
Last of Mohicans Living of the Dead MacGuffin...

95
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,770
Say "Hi" to Wolf-chan.

96
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,470
Your dog has a name that's 100-times even weirder!

97
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,210
They can do it once, twice, it doesn't matter. But my dog is male.

98
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,230
Oh, that's all right. There are all kinds of ways. You are, after all, Ketsuno...Ana.

99
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,230
[Note: This is a play on the fact that Ketsuno-ana can mean butthole.]

100
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,020
That wasn't very nice! Not only was it not nice, it was awful!

101
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,580
A Frisbee?

102
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,810
Oh, we see this dog a lot on our walks...

103
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,210
Gin-chan, Sadaharu likes her...

104
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,980
Huh?

105
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,200
Hey, hey, what's so good about a girl with such a long body and short legs...

106
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,230
You have eccentric taste in women.

107
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,640
Sadaharu, were you always thinking of her on your walks?

108
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,250
Meru-chaaan!!

109
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,700
What the hell, you giant dog?!

110
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,580
What're you doing to my Meru-chan? Get away from her!

111
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,680
Ugh! That 70-30 part...

112
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,750
The Gutter Rat Gang's...

113
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,890
Katsuo the Black Piece

114
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,490
What?!

115
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,640
Yakuza!

116
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,850
Sadaharu, wait!

117
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,240
Stop! What're you guys doing with my Meru-chan?!

118
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,880
Boss!

119
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,540
I thought they looked familiar-they're those guys who live above Otose...

120
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,660
What?!

121
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,750
You guys don't give up, do you?! I hope you came prepared to die!

122
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,280
Wait, wait, wait! You've got it all wrong! That's not why we're here!

123
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,150
Seems our pet dog has feelings for your Meru-chan...

124
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,000
What?! What do you mean by "has feelings for"?!

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,180
He's in heat. One time's no problem, right?

126
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,860
One time, nothing! There's no way she can handle that giant dog's "one time."

127
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,180
Meru-chan just gave birth not too long ago. She can't have babies willy-nilly!

128
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,910
Kids?! What do you mean?! She comes with kids?!

129
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,370
Is she a divorcee?!

130
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,920
I can't give my Wolf The Mask to a girl with such a loose backside!

131
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,710
Come on, Wolf The Mask! We're going home!

132
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,980
Wait! Who're you saying has a loose backside?!

133
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,180
Dachshunds have very heavy backsides-that's why their legs are so short...

134
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,700
Boss! This is no time to be fighting!

135
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,120
Shut up! This is your fault for throwing that Frisbee way over here.

136
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:14,340
What?! They're on a boat! That dog knows how to date! He's no ordinary dog!

137
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,150
A woman knows she's with a man when she sees his rough hand shifting the transmission,

138
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,050
or his strong chest as he rows the oars!

139
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,640
Boss, he's not rowing!

140
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,890
After them! Go after them!

141
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,080
Protect Meru-chan's chastity!

142
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,230
That didn't work, Boss! Too many in the boat.

143
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,080
The boat's sinking!

144
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,330
Sadaharu, don't jump the gun!

145
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,970
If you touch a yakuza's woman, you'll be in big trouble!

146
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,220
I was once almost sunk to the bottom of the Edo Castle moat!

147
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,820
Meru-chan! Don't let him trick you!

148
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,200
The size of a man is measured by the size of his heart!

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,750
Back off, you two-bit thug!

150
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,580
I'm not giving up! I'll show you what happens when you underestimate a yakuza!

151
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,050
Kagura! Step on it!

152
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,950
You can't keep up with her power!

153
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,940
I'll just use you. It's effortless and much easier this way.

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,450
Isn't it about time you took a step towards starting a new life with me?!

310
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,010
I'm always walking the path of my own life.

311
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,370
I'm not staying at this house because of lingering feelings or anything silly like that.

312
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,190
Then why? Is there another man?

313
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,750
It's because...

314
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,810
I have Father.

315
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,870
We may not be related by blood, but he is my Father...

316
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,150
...There might be moles like that under the road...

317
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,050
along the S-curve...

318
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,180
No way! And that was just too long a reason!

319
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,950
That's wasn't "might" driving or anything! It was just your delusion!

320
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,270
Sakata-san, thank you for stopping the car.

321
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,550
We must stop before a rail crossing...

322
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,850
Why're you crying

323
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,680
Please open the window...

324
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,030
There isn't one anymore.

325
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,880
You have to "might" drive here, as well. A train might come.

326
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,780
The crossing bar might come down. Listen to make sure.

327
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,150
Of course, this is a driving school, so there are no tracks,

328
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,940
and no train will pass, but please do it as a formality.

329
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,180
Yes.

330
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,260
No, wait!

331
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,960
I hear it... I can hear the sound of a train coming!

332
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,100
I don't hear it.

333
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,690
No, I can hear it! And the sound of the crossing bar coming down!

334
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,960
I can hear it clearly!

335
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,200
Hey, he's really lost it. Somebody call a doctor.

336
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,530
Ack! That's!

337
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,840
Father!

338
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,540
If I disappear... Matsuko can be happy...

339
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,250
If I move now,

340
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,990
I might get there in time!

341
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,360
You fool! What'd you do that for?! You were almost killed!

342
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,260
What good would your death do?!

343
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,000
Did you think that was what Matsuko would want?!

344
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,090
Matsuko would never be happy if she stayed with me.

345
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,190
I will certainly die before she does.

346
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,180
When that happens, what will old, alone and left behind Matsuko do?

347
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,400
I...I would be better off gone...

348
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,450
If I'm gone, Matsuko would be released from the shackles I have placed on her and be free.

349
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,690
That's where you're wrong, Father!

350
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,690
You're...Matsuko!

351
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,850
All I want is to be with you... Father...

352
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,090
Father...

353
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,560
Matsuko...

354
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,230
Father...

355
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,510
Father!

356
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,380
Sakata-san...

357
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,300
Yes?

358
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,100
Maybe we shouldn't be "might" driving anymore.

359
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,680
You might be right.

360
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,210
Ma...Matsuko...

361
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,400
Fath...er...

362
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,180
And so, recent Bakufu activity...

363
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,280
Let's leave that for now.

364
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,460
I happened to have watched "Summer Sonata" the other day, and...

365
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,190
Hey, did you watch yesterday's "Changam's Humiliation"?

366
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,080
[Note: Spoof of Dae Jang Geum: Jewel in the Palace, a Korean TV drama series.]

367
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,190
Summer...

368
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,180
It was great.

369
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,610
The main character's so brave, I cried.

370
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,360
TV...

371
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,390
Let me borrow a copy.

372
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,260
Summ...

373
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,280
T...

374
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,220
Cut it out! Listen to what I have to say!

375
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,700
Don't do that to me when I made the effort to watch the show!

376
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,300
Katsura-san, "Summer Sonata" is old now. "Changam's Humiliation" is popular now.

377
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,270
What?!

378
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,730
You jump from one new thing to the next.

379
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,500
I've had enough! I'm never watching another TV drama!

380
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,910
I'm leaving!

381
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,660
Katsura-san!

382
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,840
Please wait, Katsura-san!

383
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,890
Excuse me, do you have "Changam's Naked Body"?

384
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,970
It's "humiliation." Yes, we do. Your membership card, please.

385
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,990
I don't have one.

386
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,860
Then I'll create one. May I see some ID?

387
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:45,080
[Wanted: Anti-Foreigner Faction Ronin, Kotaro Katsura. Call 110.]

388
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,590
Use this.

389
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:26,380
[Preview]

390
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,970
We headed into the mountains in autumn hoping to make some money from matsutake mushrooms.

391
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,690
While we were there, we came across a giant bear known as

392
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,870
the "master of the mountain" and the hunter who pursues him.

393
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,030
The next episode...

394
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,110
"Think for a Minute Now, Do Matsutake Mushrooms Really Taste All That Good?"

395
