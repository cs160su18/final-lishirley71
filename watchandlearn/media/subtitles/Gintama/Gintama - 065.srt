It's a dung beetle.

Hey! You mean it eats poop?!

16

00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,360
Sogo, you've been using unorthodox tactics to hunt beetles again.

161
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,850
I told you to stop.

162
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,090
And catching beetles by painting the forest with mayonnaise isn't unorthodox?

163
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,850
Toshi, you're still trying to catch beetles with mayonnaise?

164
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,540
I said it's impossible. Let's go with Operation Honey!

165
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,660
No, let's go with Mayonnaise Desperation.

166
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,610
No, let's go with the Narikiri Wars Episode III.

167
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,280
No, let's go with the Injured Honey Murder in Steam.

168
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,050
Oh, there! Chief, look!

169
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,190
It's time for beetle hunting!

170
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,400
Hey, wait! Don't touch that beetle!

171
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,530
I'm ordering you to go home!

172
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,830
Bite me! I won't let you keep them all for yourself.

173
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,570
Those beetles belong to everyone! I mean, they all belong to me!

174
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,500
Damn it! Hey, don't let him get it! We have to get it first!

175
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,640
Beetle hunting time!

176
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,870
Beetle Smash!

177
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,050
Beetle... Kick!

178
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,500
Bee...

179
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
...tle...?!

180
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,830
Crash!!

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,030
Beetle...

182
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,600
I won't let you say that!

183
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,650
Beetle...

184
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,080
I'll say it... Beetle...

185
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,470
Bee...

186
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,810
...eee...

187
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,840
...tle...

188
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,120
Hey, wait...

189
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,580
We're friends, right? We are...

190
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,180
Buster!

191
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,110
It's gone...

192
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,790
It sure is gone...

193
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,760
Really, what a troublesome group of misfits.

194
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,210
What should we do, Toshi?

195
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,880
For now, we have to make sure they don't find out about it.

196
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,600
They're sure to make trouble if they learn the truth.

197
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,150
After all, it's worth a king's ransom.

198
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,870
Right! We'll search for it all night.

199
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,060
We have to return "Rurimaru" to Shogun-sama as soon as possible.

200
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,120
Yeah!

201
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,320
That girl...I'll beat her this time...

202
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,620
This curry isn't very tasty.

203
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,130
I told you I like country-style curry with

204
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,600
potato and vegetables melted into a thick stew.

205
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,860
Shut up! Why are you speaking with a Kansai accent?!

206
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,930
If you like it thick, then put slime on your rice and suck it!

207
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,490
You have to sauté the onions to a golden brown. That's the cardinal rule of cooking curry!

208
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,420
If you're going to cook, do it right, uh-huh!

209
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,350
Ah! How 'bout I sauté you to a golden brown?

210
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,240
Ah? How 'bout I microwave you till you explode?

211
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,310
Yeah, yeah. Cut it out, you two.

212
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,010
You guys have been on edge ever since we met the Shinsengumi.

213
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,590
But I'm not blaming you after that nasty battle.

214
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,370
Well, let's enjoy dinner, at least.

215
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,150
Anyway, I wonder if they really came here to catch beetles.

216
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,970
In fact, they look too serious...

217
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,500
Hey! What was that for, Kagura-chan?!

218
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,250
A mosquito...

219
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,730
Let's go back to what I was talking about...

220
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,650
A mosquito...

221
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
You bastards, stop it already!

222
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,010
Are you using mosquitoes as an excuse to take out your frustrations on me?

223
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,470
No, but the mosquito...

224
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,800
Seriously, cut it out. How can we hunt beetles effectively when we're so divided?

225
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,740
All right, I'm sorry. I was being childish.

226
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,240
I'm sorry, Kagura. I'll try to make country-style curry next time.

227
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,710
Well, that's all right.

228
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,440
I actually prefer city-style better than country-style. I'm sorry, Gin-chan.

229
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,180
I see. Then I'll make city-style curry next time.

230
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,540
You bastard, Shinpachi!

231
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,940
You were pretending to be a good boy, but you were waiting for your chance!

232
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,830
You're so optimistic! You know how many years I've been around you?!

233
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,920
The curry! The city-style curry!

234
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,100
How could you do this to me?! I was going to have seconds!

235
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,960
I only had two bites! What are you going to do about this?!

236
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,930
I didn't even take a bite! Understand?!

237
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,520
Yamazaki, that's enough. It worked.

238
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,560
Yes, sir. But they're such dopes.

239
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,270
They have a falling out just over mosquitoes.

240
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,050
After they've beaten each other to a pulp, they'll leave the forest.

241
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,160
Not necessarily. You never know with these guys.

242
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,970
I'm so hungry I can't sleep.

243
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,360
It's all in your head.

244
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,670
It's not my head, it's my stomach, uh-huh!

245
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,600
At least you ate a whole plate!

246
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,060
I wanted lots of helpings, not just one.

247
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,170
What's that smell?!

248
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,280
Yummy! Nothing beats a barbecue when you're camping!

249
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,430
You can eat curry at our house anytime!

250
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,460
And it was a pain to haul pickled vegetables out here!

251
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,050
Hey, where's the mayonnaise?

252
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,820
Vice-Chief, this is a ploy to make them think we're enjoying a good meal.

253
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,920
So mayonnaise isn't...

254
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,650
Bastard! Are you disrespecting mayonnaise?!

255
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,120
Mayonnaise goes well with everything!

256
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,390
Hi, you guys, are you still here?

257
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,740
The mosquitoes will eat you alive if you sleep in a cheap tent like that.

258
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,800
Oops! I dropped it!

259
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,230
Hey, Captain Okita! Forget about it.

260
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,890
There's plenty more over here, so come back!

261
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,210
All right.

262
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,480
So, I've got to go. Ah! You can eat that if you want.

263
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,580
Look at their faces.

264
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,070
It's only a matter of time before they get so hungry they leave the forest... Huh?!

265
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,300
There's nothing like pickled seaweed when you're camping.

266
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,870
Barbecue? Isn't that tacky? Isn't it too ordinary?

267
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,720
Isn't it boring? City people eat pickled seaweed.

268
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,690
What?!

269
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,510
They're roasting pickled seaweed and eating it!

270
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,160
That looks pathetic! So pathetic!

271
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,430
Hey, tax thieves! You're still here?

272
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,250
Who are you calling tax thieves?

273
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,030
There's no way we're gonna give you our barbecue.

274
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:29,060
You know... If you guys barbecue at a place like this, you know...

275
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,830
It's going to be... U...a problem... U...

276
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,780
Hey, what are you doing? What are you...?

277
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,090
That's disgusting! She puked in it!! Gross! It reeks!

278
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,790
How could you do that?! Now I don't feel like eating anymore!

279
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,280
Ah, shoot! I feel... Ugh!

280
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,770
Yamazaki threw up, too!

281
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,830
I see...

282
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,330
Just as I thought, they were tough.

283
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,170
We didn't have any success, either.

284
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,700
All we caught were ordinary beetles...

285
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,580
Look, men, even if the chief asks you, you can say no if you don't like it.

286
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,550
Well, but it's The Honey Plan.

287
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,570
But why did you have to put honey all over yourselves?!

288
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,860
Shogun-sama said he lost Rurimaru while recuperating at his second villa in this forest.

289
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,650
Where could Rurimaru be?

290
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,000
Huh? Speaking of that, where's Sogo?

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,860
He went off on his own again.

292
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,150
He's such a rogue. He's been shaking down kids for their beetles. So rotten.

293
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:29,270
Rurimaru looks like a glittering jewel of living gold.

294
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,310
But at first glance, he's just like any other beetle.

295
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,130
A glittering jewel of living gold... Does a bug like that really...

296
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,640
Gin-chan! Shinpachi!

297
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,070
Look! Look at that! There's something strange over there!

298
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,980
Huh? Does something weird mean a gorilla covered in mayonnaise again?

299
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,390
You always find something weird.

300
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,500
No, no! That one!

301
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,420
It's a shiny golden beetle!

302
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,040
What?!

303
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,560
She found it so easily!

304
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,930
No! That is...

305
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,790
Wait!

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,790
Did you just hear a weird voice?

307
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,560
In the forest, there're still many mysterious creatures that humans don't know about.

308
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,700
Don't worry about everything.

309
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,840
Calm down.

310
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,280
If we make a fuss, they'll realize how valuable Rurimaru is. Let's see how it goes.

311
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,460
Isn't it a toy or something?

312
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,470
No, not that. It's a blow-fly. Don't touch it! It's really filthy.

313
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,510
See, they're complete idiots. Idiots!

314
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,520
But it looks so cool! It's so shiny.

315
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,530
I said no. They're infested in poop.

316
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:32,910
It's the same in nature and the human world, something this flashy is never good.

317
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,760
Yes!

318
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,820
They left! They really are imbeciles!!

319
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,270
Now! Hurry up and get Rurimaru!

320
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,690
Rurimaru...!

321
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,200
No! This terrible!

322
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,360
Whoa! It's gross! There's a blow-fly on your head!

323
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,940
W-Wait! Don't move! Don't move!

324
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,450
You've got cooties!

325
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,890
Stop! That's the Shogun's pet!

326
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,410
Die, you bastard! Damn it! It's too quick!

327
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,130
Ow! That hurts!

328
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,060
Hey, hold still! The blow-fly is on your head! It thinks you're poop!

329
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,320
Wait! Wait! Wait!

330
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,860
Don't do it!! That is...

331
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,030
Whoa! Ruri...Rurimaru!

332
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,300
That hurts!

333
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,540
You guys are so mean!

334
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,660
Even if it is just a blow-fly, it's a living thing! Don't you feel sorry for it?!

335
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,780
Ah, that's a relief!

336
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,790
It seems to be all right.

337
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,470
Wait! It's not a blow-fly. It's... That's actually...

338
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,040
This little one flew to me because he likes me.

339
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,930
He must be Sadaharu No. 28's successor.

340
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,860
Hey, are you listening to me?!

341
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,180
This is the time to avenge your predecessor! Let's go, Sadaharu No. 29!

342
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,590
Hey, wait! That's the Shogun's-!

343
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,060
Shogun's...what?

344
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,300
Huh?

345
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,020
The Shogun's pet?

346
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,270
That's right.

347
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,070
Under the Bakufu's order,

348
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,800
we came here to capture Shogun-sama's beloved pet, Rurimaru.

349
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,930
So that's it. I knew you were up to something.

350
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,650
Hey, hey. You came all the way out here for just a bug?

351
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,630
What a tough assignment for a government official.

352
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,350
That's why I didn't want to tell him.

353
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,280
Well, now that they know the whole story. Let's get them to help us.

354
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,570
It's 60%!

355
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,720
Huh?

356
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,980
Right now, Little Lolimaru is already in our hands.

357
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,200
It's Rurimaru.

358
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,150
Here's the deal. If you want Porimaru back, you have to agree to our terms.

359
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,470
It's Rurimaru.

360
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,830
If you capture Gorimaru, you'll get some great reward, right?

361
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,640
So I'm saying I take 60% of it.

362
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,880
It's Rurimaru.

363
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,450
That's why I didn't want to tell him.

364
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,060
I agree.

365
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,320
All right, it's a deal.

366
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,900
Shinpachi, it looks like we don't have to worry about the rent for a while.

367
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,630
Sweet!

368
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,270
I finally found you, Mazo-no, Sazomaru!

369
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,190
Sogo?!

370
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,070
Kagura? Huh? What is she doing? I have a bad feeling...

371
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,440
Kagura!

372
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,560
Sogo! What are you doing?!

373
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,580
I'm going to avenge Sadaharu No. 28. I'm challenging you to a duel.

374
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,670
I knew you'd come. I've prepared my best bug for this occasion.

375
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,680
I'm looking forward to it. I'll show you the strength of Sadaharu No. 29.

376
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Now! Let's have a fair fight!

377
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,720
Wait! They're going to have a beetle sumo match!

378
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,430
Kagura, listen to me! That's the shogun's pet!

379
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,790
If you hurt it, we'll be in big trouble! They'll make us commit seppuku! Seppuku!

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,840
Toshi!

381
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,180
Well, just wait. If Sogo wins, we'll get Rurimaru back for free.

382
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,460
I think Sogo made a calculated decision.

383
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,460
He won't do anything violent. He's not that stupid.

384
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,240
Behold the brutal and monstrous man-eating beetle king, Sadomaru No. 22

385
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,100
Kabuto!

386
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,340
He's that stupid!

387
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,070
Hey! Hold on!!

388
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,340
Do you realize what that thing will do to Rurimaru if they fight?

389
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,740
I'm going to crush him.

390
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,460
Right! It'll reduce him to pieces!

391
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,270
Kagura-chan, Sadaharu No. 29 will be demolished into pieces!

392
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,620
Fighting isn't about body size! It's about guts!

393
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,850
You're the only one who has guts!

394
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,820
It's a pampered upbringing.

395
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,170
Lolimaru had a pampered upbringing and was protected by the Shogun!

396
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,540
I said it's Rurimaru!

397
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,810
We have to stop them! Hurry up and stop them!

398
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,870
It's impossible! I can't climb this cliff!

399
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,070
We have to work together!

400
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,870
There's no hardship we can't overcome if four samurai work together!

401
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,220
Then you'll be the base! I'll climb and do something!

402
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,990
No way! You be the base!

403
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,470
Now isn't the time to argue!

404
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,000
We're wasting precious time!

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,850
Grow up and be a good stepping-stone! There's no way I'm gonna get down on all fours for you!

406
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,240
You grow up!

407
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,020
Kabuto!

408
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,360
Take this! Sado-beam!

409
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,110
Tsk. How obstinate!

410
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,730
Can I defeat you now? I didn't get your answer, though...

Sado-slash!

416

Beetle...

417
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,490
...hunting!

418
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,230
Sadomaru!

419
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,080
Yes!

420
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,060
He did it!

421
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,930
Mister! How dare you? My Sadomaru...!

422
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,800
Gin-chan, you're so mean! You disrupted our match!

423
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,290
Ow!

424
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,310
Ow!

You idiots!

426
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,780
If you want to fight, then get into the ring yourselves and duke it out!

427
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,580
You shouldn't toy with other creatures' lives!

428
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,210
I'll kill you, you bastards! Beetles, earthworms or water striders,
