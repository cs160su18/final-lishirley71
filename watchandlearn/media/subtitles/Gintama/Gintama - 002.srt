And you're a former gangster, aren't you?

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,150
You shouldn't have damaged your hair when you were young.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,530
I don't have to take that from someone with naturally wavy hair!

You're breakin' my heart...

It's not like I wanted wavy hair!

Nice catch.

Oh, I see, sideshow practice...

Yes! Isn't that right?

We have to apologize, Gin.

Hey, get me down from here!

Ah well, so it goes.

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,230
We're getting used to working for nothing.

29
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,080
It's no use worrying about it.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,160
I had a feeling when we took the job that it wouldn't work out. Really.

Oh, well...

33
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,820
I didn't know Gin would be so cold-hearted.

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,510
That's how he is.

35
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,840
He'll let anyone in, but doesn't stand in their way if they want to leave.

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,420
By the way, Kagura, why did you come to my house?

37
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,710
Why are you eating my rice?

38
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,630
Dinner is right next door.

39
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,940
It's not next door!

If you don't believe in Gin, who will?

45

No! He doesn't deserve it, Otae.

00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,370
Like I've been saying,

you can't trust a guy who has the eyes of a dead fish.

You're the bastard! You stalker!

49
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,940
Is he still stalking her?

I'll finish you off!

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,220
Yeah, but it's hard to explain.

Wh-What's that?

Helps me forget all my worries for a moment.

But I'll be reminded of them tomorrow.

62
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,720
And I think they'll be even bigger headaches than they were today.

63
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,380
It is not like you can run away from them.

Especially...

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,530
...those things you really want to forget.

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,880
I may have wanted an excuse.

An excuse?

68
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,980
I already told you that I was fired, my house was taken from me,

69
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,070
and my family left me, didn't I?

70

I used to be a salesman.

I believed that I could keep working for them. But...

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,730
I still don't understand it.

76
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,810
I didn't do anything wrong, but I was fired from the company.

77
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,210
So, I went and got drunk,

78
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,950
and those guys stamped my seal on a contract without my permission.

79

Then the land shark came and showed us the bogus contract, saying I had to leave my house.

A letter?

85
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes. My daughter sent me a letter right before my eviction.

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,660
"Daddy, I want to come home soon."

87
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,990
By then, I had given up on everything.

But after reading her letter, I wanted to give it another try.

Does that sound stupid?

90
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,280
I believed that if I got my house back, my family would return.

91

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,330
Course gate open!

168
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,460
Higashi-Murayama One, prepare for launch.

169
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,180
Higashi-Murayama One, prepare for launch.

170
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,120
Let's go!

171
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,040
Roger!

172
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,450
Enjoy this view while you can.

173
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,790
This is your last view of Edo.

174
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,830
It's no use!

175
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,110
Help me, you guys!

176
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,600
Hey, Kagura! Go help him.

177
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,810
You're from the Yato clan, aren't you?

178
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,240
I ain't falling for that.

179
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,200
I won't move until I finish all the food.

180
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,360
Geez.

181
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,960
Elizabeth!

182
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,830
What are you doing here?

183
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,970
Ah, Zura must be here, right?

184
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,400
It's not Zura. It's Katsura.

185
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,860
While you guys were living it up, we snuck in the back.

186
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,620
And we found something in the safe.

187
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,000
What? Did you find it? Is that Katoken's contract?

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,190
I don't know anything about that. But look at this.

189
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,280
I would, but... I'm having a hard time with small print.

190
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,170
What do you think about these documents, Gintoki?

191
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,940
I have no idea.

192
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,210
Then let me explain.

193
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,250
They intend to raze Edo to the ground.

194
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,300
What?!

195
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,450
They'll have a rave in Edo?

196
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,810
He said "raze," stupid!

197
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,470
Let me give you a brief explanation.

198
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,670
They discovered an earthquake fault line

199
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,480
and they stimulated that point with an Amanto-made device.

200
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,240
It will cause a giant artificial earthquake.

201
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,540
And Edo will be destroyed!

202
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,300
Oh, no...

203
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,080
That sounds like some kind of evil anime organization.

204
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,390
But why would they do something like that?

205
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,190
Those people who were with Kariya are land sharks.

206
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,730
They snatch up homes lost by others.

207
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,530
And their goal is the old city?

208
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,450
Buildings that weren't constructed by Amanto are not very strong.

209
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,720
If a big earthquake hits, they'll collapse in a moment.

210
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,890
Oh no! Edo will...

211
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,810
But we don't know where the point is.

212
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,520
Aren't there any clues?

213
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,480
Well, unfortunately...

214
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,640
So what do we do now?

215
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,070
We don't have time to find the land sharks in Edo!

216
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,410
Kagura! You've had enough food, right?

217
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,880
Break us out of this cage!

218
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,580
You got it!

219
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,360
Why didn't you do this earlier?!

220
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,030
Katoken!

221
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,140
Y-Yes!

222
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,510
Where is your house?

223
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,170
Hey, Gintoki!

224
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,170
Where are you going?

225
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,500
It's dangerous if you go alone!

226
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,140
I know, but we still have to go!

227
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,230
See you, Zura.

228
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,530
It's not Zura! It's Katsura!

229
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,900
Gin! What's going on?

230
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,120
Basically, their goal is to clear the land in Edo and then sell it at a higher price.

231
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,950
Right...

232
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,120
Then why did they clear Katoken's house first?

233
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,600
Well...

234
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,350
I got it!

235
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,790
It's the earthquake fault line!

236
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,300
That's right.

237
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,720
So he's fired and cheated and has his house taken away ...

238
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,810
All part of their plan.

239
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,700
That's terrible!

240
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,200
Anyway, let's go!

241
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,730
Yah!

242
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,340
Um...

243
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,830
What is it?

244
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,520
If you have something to say, say it now!

245
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,590
Right!

246
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,290
We have no time to lose.

247
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,000
Then I say... We're going the wrong direction.

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What?!

249
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:08,150
So, this is the Drift Star earthquake machine, hehe!

250
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,980
And this device will realize Mr. Kariya's ambition!

251
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,210
Our time will come soon.

252
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,930
Begin!

253
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,030
All right!

254
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,850
Rock drilling beam activated!

255
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,200
Ten minutes to reach the target!

256
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,100
Go! No one can stop us!

257
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,000
Intruders! Get them!

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,060
What?

259
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,510
This is a raid!

260
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,950
We're the Shinsengumi! Calm yourselves!

261
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,690
Government dogs!

262
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,990
Oh, so you're ready to take on the Shinsengumi?

263
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,660
Interesting.

264
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,020
I'm Isao Kondo!

265
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,720
Toshiro Hijikata!

266
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,700
Sogo Okita!

267
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's go!

268
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,470
Hold it right there!

269
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,810
What did you say? No, you hold it!

270
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,640
Let me spell it out for you.

271
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,730
This is Drift Star territory.

272
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,680
If you take a single step into this house, it'll be an international incident.

273
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,270
Damn it! Extraterritoriality, huh?

274
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,470
Crap!

275
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,330
Anyway, what's extraterritoriality?

276
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,560
If you want to get into the house, you need to go through official procedures.

277
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,010
Sogo, what are you doing?

278
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,560
Well, if I tore down this house, we could go inside, right?

279
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,520
Are you Mr. Ikkyu or something?

280
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Feh... If you understand, then you'd better leave.

281
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,300
Thanks for the assistance! Make way for the star!

282
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,150
That's...

283
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,960
Odd Jobs?

284
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,460
He's here...

285
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,300
Leave the rest to us!

286
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,710
Hocha!

287
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,190
Odd Jobs Gin will take care of the problem!

288
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,720
Hocha!

289
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,010
I see. He can do whatever he likes!

290
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm addicted...

291
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,810
Mr. Kariya, let's go inside.

292
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,710
Wait!

293
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,260
It's time you and I settled this.

294
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,540
Huh, stop playing the role of my rival, Mr. Sideshow!

295
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,490
You!

296
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,260
Five minutes until we reach the target!

297
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,570
Good. Allow it to approach the epicenter and pull out!

298
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,220
Right!

299
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,890
Machine, surface!

300
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,380
An Earthquake?

301
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,510
Did they already...?

302
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,100
What?

303
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,660
What the hell is this contraption? It could destroy the world!

304
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,230
This is too much, even for a special two-part episode!

305
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,980
So this is the device that Zura was talking about?

306
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,020
Excellent. Our plan is on the verge of success.

307
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,740
No! Edo will...

308
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,760
Shinpachi!

309
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,690
You'll have to fight me.

310
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,840
You...

311
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,230
Three minutes until we reach the target!

312
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,820
M-My house...

313
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,730
What?

314
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,750
Katoken!

315
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,100
Dumbass! Why did you leave him alone?

316
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,600
Well, he looked really sick.

317
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,250
Go, Katoken! Stop them!

318
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,720
B-But...

319
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,250
I'll cut you down.

320
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,470
I-I...

321
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,880
Don't run away!

322
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,710
You have to change first, or nothing else will!

323
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,000
...Change...?

324
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,170
You can't run away!

325
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,650
Especially from those things you really want to forget!

326
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,980
Daddy...

327
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,440
I...

328
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,340
I...will change!

329
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,190
If I suppress my inner "self", my face will look just like Antonio Inoki's!

330
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,840
What?

331
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,240
How are you?

332
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,520
You're bluffing!

333
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,670
Keep my elbow to my side and just strike...

334
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,030

One year ago, I met this man.

387
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,070
He was too delicate to be a samurai

388
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,340
and his eyes were too honest for him to be a gangster.
