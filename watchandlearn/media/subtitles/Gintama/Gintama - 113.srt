No one tries to clean the toilets.

They dribble urine outside the urinals as
though that's how it's supposed to be.

They don't wash their hands.

germ-covered hands.

Yes. It's a suggestion by my squad

He requests that we at least
change the faucets

to spend on such useless projects.

spend cleaning toilets,

spend it cleaning the Anti-Foreigner
Faction in the city.

Begging the Vice-Chief's pardon,

117
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,540
but do you wash your hands
after doing your business?

118
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,140
Huh? Yeah, I wash them.

119
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,780
Then let me ask you: why
do you wash your hands?

120
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,600
Why do your hands become dirty
when you do your business?

121
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,980
You know damn well-I don't
feel right unless I wash them.

122
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,870
Don't try to hide it.

123
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,080
To be more precise,

124
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,760
it's because you touched something
that is certainly filthy, isn't that right?

125
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,010
What is it? What did you touch?
What is it that's filthy?

126
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,390
Well it's...

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,390
you know...that.

128
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,590
That's right

129
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,730
No matter how a man does it,

130
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,350
he has to touch that filthy something that

131
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,400
hangs between his legs when
he does his business!

132
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,540
In other words,

133
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,760
the act of washing one's hands
after doing one's business

134
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,410
is a way of resetting oneself
after touching that thing.

135
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,670
It is an important rite of purification
for going on with one's life!

136
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,070
However!

137
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,110
Are you aware that here at the
Shinsengumi Headquarters,

138
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,030
people think they're performing this
rite when in fact, they are not?!

139
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,170
All right.

140
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,650
Let's call the germs that
get on your hands

141
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,300
when you touch your thing, tamakin!

142

[Note: Tama (balls) + kin (germ).]

You do your business. And your
hands are covered with tamakin.

144
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,580
Hey, cut it out. Don't use
me as an example.

145
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,340
You're going to wash your
tamakin-covered hands,

146
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,310
so you turn the handle on the faucet.
You wash off the tamakin.

147
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,950
Indeed, your hands are clean
at this point.

148
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,790
However! However! Take a step back
and think about it.

149
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,890
Okay? What did you do just now to
wash off the tamakin, Vice-Chief?

150
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,820
Hey, you're getting a little too friendly.

151
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,840
That's right!

152
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,420
To turn on the water,

153
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,810
you turned the handle of the faucet
with your tamakin-covered hand!

154
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,460
Of course, a large number of tamakin
are now on the faucet!

155
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,800
Then, after washing off the tamakin,
Vice-Chief, what did you do?!

156
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
What did you do with those clean hands?

157
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,510
You turned the tamakin-covered handle
once more to turn off the water!

158
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,600
Vice-Chief, ultimately, you've
helped spread the tamakin!

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Don't make it sound so bad!

160
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,200
Why're you making it sound as though
I'm the only one who does it?!

161
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,920
If that's the case,

162
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,800
then all of you who use that faucet
are covered with tamakin, as well!

163
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,120
Too bad, Hijikata-san.

164
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,930
I don't wash my hands after
doing my business.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,490
I just leave the toilet.

166
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,320
You're directly spreading the tamakin!

167
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,540
Vice-Chief, do you understand now?

168
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,810
The way things are, the Shinsengumi
is covered with tamakin.

169
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
The only way to break through
this situation is to change

170
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,960
the faucets from handle-type
to sensor-type.

171
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,220
You think too much. You can't go about
your life if you worry about germs.

172
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,030
Utterly ridiculous!

173
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,380
Vice-Chief.

174
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,030
We're grilling corn on the cob.
Would you like to join us?

175
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,730
What the-!!

176
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,230
What is that?!

177
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,380
Did you see it, Vice-Chief?

178
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,550
Tamakin...

179
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,410
Tamakin?! You mean that?!

180
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,740
That can't be...it's everywhere...

181
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,840
It's...

182
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Hey, Toshi. What're you doing?

183
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,070
C'mon, let's eat. Sogo, Seizo-san,
you guys want to join us?

184
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,540
Hey! Kondo-san...Kondo-san's covered
in an enormous amount of tamakin!

185
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,130
It's probably because he touches
his thing an awful lot.

186
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,820
The eggs have completely hatched.

187
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,060
That's no longer Kondo-san. He's nothing
but a walking, talking tamakin.

188
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,300
How can we bring him back to normal?

189
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,980
A toilet revolution...it's the only way.

190

[Toilets]

191
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,640
That settles the installation
of sensor-type faucets.

192
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
However, there remains
a mountain of problems.

193
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,190
Look at this. We just cleaned it moments
ago, but look how bad it is.

194
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,020
I can understand a few stray drops,
but this completely missed the mark.

195
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,330
Seeing it again, it certainly
does look terrible.

196
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,740
It's probably the result of
using the toilet together.

197
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,690
When people go to the toilet in a group,

198
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,130
they talk and laugh and tend
to forget about what's below,

199
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,620
causing urine to fly in all directions.

200
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,060
Our first priority will be to establish
a "no group urination" rule.

201
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,390
Leave that to me. I'll add it to our rules.

202
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,010
However, even a single person
is still cause for worry.

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,470
I've got it!

204
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,770
What if we soil the urinal
before they use it?

205
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,840
Think about how you urinate
in a Western-style toilet.

206
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,470
If there's something stuck to the bowl...

207
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,580
you know how you unconsciously
aim at it to shoot it off?

208
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,180
We'll use that psychology and make
it so they'll aim into the urinal.

209
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,190
Hijikata-san, you've just casually
revealed an embarrassing habit.

210
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,160
Is that what you always do?

211
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,010
No, I don't do that. I heard
about it somewhere.

212
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,820
No, I think it's a great idea.

213
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,250
Okay, then...

214
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,230
How about this?

215
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,370
Huh? What is that, Sogo?

216
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,910
That's my mole!

217
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,260
I felt bad about what I did, so I
only pretended to flush it down.

218
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,850
I was hoping I'd find a good
use for it somewhere.

219
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,860
How is this a "good" use?!

220
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,200
You want someone to aim
his urine at my mole?

221
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,430
I see. Sorry about that.

222
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,520
Don't flush it down! You have no
respect for a person's body parts!

223
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:53,440
C'mon, never mind that.
Dirty it up a bit. Anything will do.

224
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,810
Oh...then I'll use this.

225
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,960
What's the meaning of that?!

226
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,780
It's the dirt of the Shinsengumi.

227
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,260
Dirty is what you are on the inside! Quit
monkeying around-take that off!

228
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,450
Someone's coming. Hide!

229
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,920
Do you think it's going to work?

230
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,090
Don't be silly! That's not going to work!

231
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,460
Okay, they left.

232
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,120
Oh...it didn't work.

233
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,400
You see.

234
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,340
They did a number two.

235
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,080
What happened?!

236
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,830
It worked too well.

237
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,070
It would seem their hatred of
the object was too great.

238
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,740
This photo has a hole poked through it.

239
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,630
What kind of urine does that?!
Do they hate me that much?!

240
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,020
We can't have them doing number twos when
we want them to clean up this place.

241
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,920
And it's no use if they don't see it as dirt.

242
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,330
What do you say we use
reverse psychology?

243
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,820
We don't make them urinate in the urinal.

244
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,180
We make it so that they can't
urinate anywhere else.

245
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,090
In other words,

246
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,660
we create a situation where they can't
ever dribble urine on the floor.

247
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,690
What kind of situation is that?!

248
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,600
Someone's coming.

249
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,060
Ah, I'm gonna pee my pants...

250
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,240
You were pretty good.

251
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,770
You weren't bad yourself.

252
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,220
I wonder how many years it's been
since I've seen the stars like this?

253
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,380
I'd forgotten the sky was this big.

254
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,010
It's kind of neat to do this sort
of thing every once in a while.

255
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,120
Who'd be able to urinate?!

256
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,080
No one would interrupt a friendly
moment between two guys.

257
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,450
That's no good! In fact, it's infuriating.

258
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,770
Are you two planning to repeat
that crummy skit of yours

259
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,430
every time someone comes to pee?!

260
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,270
Then...

261
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,310
What if we put holes in this plywood
sheet, so they can stick their...

262
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,830
What sort of perverted play is this?!

263
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,250
Listen, a lot of different guys are
going to stick their things in!

264
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,680
It's unsanitary!

265
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,330
They'll be fine with it.

266
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,620
I'll draw a woman's face here so
they won't be uncomfortable.

267
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,530
Hey! Now it's turning into something
totally different!

268
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,390
I told you, it's unsanitary!
For both body and mind!

269
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,940
Kumanaku, say something...

270
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,630
Can you make the hole
a little larger for me?

271
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,080
What're you adjusting the
size for?! Forget the ego!

272
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,590
The problem is not the
hole. It's the mouth!

273
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,810
Do you think we can broadcast this?!

274
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,600
I see. If that's the problem...

275
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,840
If we turn it around, no problem.

276
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,300
Hey, that doesn't solve the
sanitation issue at all!

277
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,470
Now, now...

278
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,560
Somebody's coming.

279
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,970
Hide.

[Two minutes later]

281
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,710
It's awfully quiet.

282
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,080
What's he doing?

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,930
[Five minutes later]

284
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,210
When's he going to leave? Take a peek.

285
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,830
...I'm...stuck.

286
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,840
I don't know why.

287
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,880
I don't know the reason,

288
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,520
but our Shinsengumi Headquarters was suddenly
taken over by mysterious germs.

289
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,240
Upon waking one morning,

290
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,780
we were attacked without
warning by the germs.

291
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,720
It happened, I believe,

292
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,310
several days after the Vice-Chief
began talking some nonsense

293
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,100
about a toilet revolution or something.

294
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Because of the excessiveness
of the revolution,

295
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,990
everyone became afraid
of going near the toilet.

296
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,060
But no one can stop their
bodily functions.

297
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,040
Headquarters became a horrible mess.

298
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,660
It was a lawless area, with no God
or Buddha. A wretched hell.

299
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,580
Perhaps that was to blame.

300
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,140
Wrath...

301
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,070
Yes, it was wrath...

302
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,620
the toilet god's wrath brought
down a hammer of retribution

303
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,430
upon us for desecrating the toilet.

304

Cut it down at its roots!

307
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,770
In other words, we have no choice
but to attack the germs' origins.

308
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,350
Origins?

309
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,070

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,140
My god!

315
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,270
Can't even tell where the urinals
and toilet bowls are...

316
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,770
What's that?!

317
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,160
The core! That's the tamakin!

318
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,890
You say it's the tamakin, but...

319
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,610
It's probably because he touches
his thing an awful lot.

320
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,550
The eggs have completely hatched.

321
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,730
That's no longer Kondo-san.

322
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,500
He's nothing but a walking,
talking tamakin.

323
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,940
Then that means it's...!

324
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,230
Kondo-san!

325
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,150
Two months later.

326
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,880
The tamakin grew at an incredible rate.

327
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,970
It swallowed Kabukicho

328
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,310
and eventually enveloped all of Edo.

329
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,340
[Shut Down]

330
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,770
A fierce battle of survival began between
the human race and tamakin.

331
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,880
[Shin]

332
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,290
That's...!

333

334
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,400
Kondoooo

335
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,300
ooohmu!

336
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,700
Kondo-san...?!

337
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,080
There's so many.

338
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,010
It's the worst possible scenario.

339
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,830
Kumanaku!

340
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,470
[Note: Parody of the costumes from Nausicaä
of the Valley of the Wind.]

341
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,470
I'm guessing that the cells
rapidly continued to divide.

342
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,700
The host's-our chief's-metabolism
couldn't keep up,

343
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,160
resulting in the host himself dividing.

344
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,850
This stampede is identical to
the run of the lemmings.

345
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,880
This stampede won't stop until
it destroys the entire world.

346
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,340
You idiot! Think of something!
This all started because you...

[Note: Parody of a costume from Nausicaä

348
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,680
Katakuriko Matsudaira, The God
of Destruction, has arrived!

349
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,130
Our targets are those god-knows-what
caterpillars! Forward!

350

Pops Matsudaira.

351
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,670
Fire cannons!

352
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,470
Pops!

353
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,480
Sogo...It's up to you and me-

354
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,020
Shinsengumi members from the
very beginning-to stop this.

355
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,070
Is that so? In that case,
I'll use my secret ability.

356
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,980
You see I am the descendent of the
most evil tribe ever to walk the Earth.

357

358
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,660
I think he's melting!

359
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,720
It's been getting hot recently.

360
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,060
That's irrelevant!

361
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,980
He did it! We might have a chance.

362
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,650
Okay, once more!

363
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,690
Hey! You're spent after just one shot?!
