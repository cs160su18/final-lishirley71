5
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,720
Listen up!

6
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,850
The purpose of today's special assignment

7
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,590
is to implore the citizens of Edo to be on the lookout for crimes...

8
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,590
and to restore the Shinsengumi's reputation, which, quite recently, has been severely tarnished.

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:01,120
So, pop idol Otsu-chan will be our "Chief For The Day" and help us improve our public image!

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,200
So listen up! Whatever you do today, just be on your best behavior!

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,070
And also respect Otsu-chan... I mean the Chief...and learn how to capture people's hearts!

12
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,010
It's really Otsu-chan!

13
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,140
Your autograph! Please give me your autograph!

14
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,310
Idiots!

15
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,570
We won't be able to control the citizens if we can't even control ourselves.

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,050
Sorry about that, Chief. I haven't trained them very well...

17
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,090
That's all right.

18
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,890
What's with your uniform?! You got her autograph!

19
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,770
I'll wear it forever. As long as my life lasts!

20
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,260
Well, it seems morale has suddenly gone up.

21
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,700
It isn't morale. They're just flipping out.

22
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,580
Terakado-san, this is today's schedule.

23
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,110
Oh, right.

24
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,260
All you have to do is stand there and smile, so take it easy.

25
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,480
Um...

26
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,180
If I'm going to do anything, I don't want to do it halfway.

27
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,130
My father always told me

28
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,090
that no matter what the job is, I should tackle it with everything I've got.

29
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,550
Well...but...

30
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,280
Even if it's just for a day, I want to do a good job as Chief,

31
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,570
so I've thought up various ideas to help improve the Shinsengumi's image.

32
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,600
No, that's all right. Just your being here...

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,930
Hey, you guys! That's enough!

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,310
You have a bad reputation because all you do is fight!

35
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,310
Settling everything with violence is as low as you can get!

36
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,270
As of right now, I'm banning violence for today.

37
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,980
Take off those swords on your waists!

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,340
Hey, does this little girl really think she's the boss?

39
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,670
Those guys can't be controlled by just anyone.

40
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,670
And besides, there's no way we could enforce anything without our weapons.

41
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,860
The sword is a samurai's soul.

42
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,620
We're sorry, Chief!

43
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,330
Should I change careers?

44
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,330
Toshi! Sogo! What're you doing?! Hurry up and drop your weapons!

45
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,810
Kondo-san, I think you've dropped your brain.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,870
We have to work at improving our image!

47
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,280
Do you think I called Otsu-chan over here for no reason?

48
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,080
No, I think you called her because you had lecherous motives.

49
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,630
Otsu-chan... I mean, the Chief...

50
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,080
was once hung out to dry because of a scandal and she hit rock bottom.

51
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,140
But despite that, she sang anywhere she could with a never-give-up attitude.

52
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,500
And when music producer Tsunpo recognized her talent,

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,570
they completely cleaned up her image.

54
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,100
Today, she's returned to be one of Edo's top pop idols.

55
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,070
She's a phoenix-like pop star!

56
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,280
I know people call you the 24-hour police thugs behind your backs.

57
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,550
Now that I'm Chief,

58
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,850
I will do my best to thoroughly improve your public image

59
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,310
using the show business strategies pounded into me by Tsunpo-san.

60
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,140
First, we must erase the brutal image that has followed you around!

61
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,320
So, I think we should start by changing this rule.

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,330
Rule: "Do not violate the Way of the Samurai.

63
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,150
Violators must commit seppuku."

64
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,830
It sounds cool, but it's a little scary.

65
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,960
So, from today on, we'll go with this. Pork ginger sauté.

66
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,350
Add something cute to the end of your sentences.

67
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,640
Violators must commit seppuku. Cloned human.

68
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,740
That wasn't cute. You left in the most dangerous part: seppuku.

69
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,630
I couldn't remove it without losing the samurai style. Camel hump.

70
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,520
No samurai style whatsoever is left- Moomin.

71
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,180
There you go. That's it.

72
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,450
Shut up!

73
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,280
There's nothing we can do about it, Hijikata-san.

74
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,060
Let's just grin and bear it today. Drink one-liter of soy sauce and die, Hijikata, you bastard.

75
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,530
When you say it, it sounds even more hateful.

76
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,310
Also, we can't erase the image that you're a bunch of grubby guys,

77
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,450
so I think you need a friendly mascot- Nori bento.

78
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,450
[Note: Nori bento = seaweed boxed lunch]

79
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,120
So, I came up with one. Domestic violence.

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,870
Over here, over here.

81
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,880
The Shinsengumi mascot: Makoto-chan.

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,490
That's not cute at all!! What's this got to do with the Shinsengumi?!

83
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,670
Why's he carrying a dead body?! Which one? Which one is Makoto-chan?!

84
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,360
The horse. Sweet bean jelly.

85
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,540
I've never seen a mascot with such dismal eyes!

86
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,650
Forget being cute, I see...

87
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,900
a symbol of tragedy!

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,010
Oh... I did it...

89
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,950
He said he did it! What? Is that what he did?

90
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,200
Toshi, these days just being cute isn't enough. Yogurt.

91
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,040
Take a good look. It's quite gro...cu...

92
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,250
What'd you do that for! Daffunda!

93
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,250
[Note: "Daffunda" was an expression used by comedian Ken Shimura in his short sketches.]

94
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,530
Oh stop it. Tenshindon.

95
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,530
[Note: Tenshindon is egg on rice. Like egg foo yung.]

96
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:24,360
They walk haughtily through the streets.

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,530
As they flaunt "justice."

98
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,660
Everything they say is for the sake of appearances.

99
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,370
But they close their mouths when it comes to the truth.

100
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,370
I gotta say, Chief, your popularity is just what I expected.

101
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,050
Everywhere you go it's packed with fools. Fall off a cliff and die, Hijikata.

102
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,220
But what is this song?

103
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,420
It sounds like she's mocking us. Get punched and kicked and die, Okita.

104
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,210
You're too self-conscious.

105
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,960
It sounds like a sweet love song to me. Die of gas poisoning and go to hell, Hijikata.

106
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,100
Thank you, everyone! Corn poop!

107
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,430
Corn poop!

108
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,840
Sounds like it'll make our image even worse. Fall off a cliff and die, Okita.

109
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,660
What if there actually is a terrorist incident?

110
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,680
We don't have our swords. Get splashed with boiling water and die, Hijikata

111
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,660
I don't care anymore. Moomin, kill Okita!

112
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,610
Die, Hijikata.

113
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,520
Die, Okita.

114
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,640
Die, Okita. Oops, I mean Hijikata.

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,820
Great job, Chief.

116
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,300
Thank you.

117
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,430
Wow. You're amazing, Chief.

118
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,270
I never realized how you could gather

119
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,940
so much attention with just some small twists. Bamboo shoots.

120
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,430
When it comes to a positive image, it's difficult to create, but easy to destroy.

121
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,650
You people had the worst possible image to begin with,

122
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,560
so we just had to start from scratch. Phantom azuki bean washer.

123
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,630
Hey, she says the worst things with the greatest of ease...

124
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,840
It's a sad story.

125
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,040
We work hard every day to protect the peace in Edo,

126
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,410
but we just seem to be running in circles.

127
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,130
What we aspire to be and the image people have of us are totally different. Limbo dance.

128
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,830
But you Shinsengumi guys are quite commendable.

129
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,130
Usually, people can't even take an honest look at how others see them.

130
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,660
But if you're too concerned with how others see you,

131
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,430
you'll be paralyzed. Slippery phantom.

132
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,640
What's with these conversations? It's kind of creepy...

133
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,410
I was the same way.

134
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,050
I was rocked by a scandal and became so concerned about how everyone saw me

135
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,110
that I became too afraid to even step outside. Badger's balls.

136
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,120
Did she just say "balls"? A pop idol said balls? Is she really a pop idol?

137
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,040
But it's not easy changing people's minds.

138
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,380
I just said, forget it.

139
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,730
I decided to become the best person I could be.

140
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,280
After that, everything seemed a lot brighter. Teriyaki burger.

141
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,280
But I think I was only able to come to that realization because of all the time

142
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,300
I had spent suffering under other people's image of me. Eel pie.

143
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,270
It's not good to be too concerned with how people see you...

144
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,780
But you shouldn't ignore them, either. It's difficult---the Cat Returns.

145
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,780
But I'm sure you all can do it. You're already suffering through it. Princess Mononoke.

146
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,520
Otsu-chan... You're a good woman. Daffunda.

147
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,410
You just said "Daffunda" twice.

148
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,340
The next time you say it, you'll have to commit seppuku. Camel hump.

149
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,540
Oh, you said that twice, as well, Otsu-chan. Elephant's trunk.

150
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,870
What? Then let's say it never happened.

151
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,100
It'll be our secret. Just between the two of us. Mouse tail.

152
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,940
I feel like knocking them out, but...

153
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,880
You bastard! You were fooling around with Otsu-chan!

154
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,930
Mako-chan's...!

155
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,450
There's another Mako-chan inside Mako-chan!

156
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,360
Huh? Where'd the top half go?

157
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,240
Oh... I did it...

158
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,250
I totally did it... I did it.

159
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,200
I thought it was a boar. Now I've done it.

160
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,710
Sir, I don't know what happened, but what's done is done.

161
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,560
Drink and forget about it.

162
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,010
I shot that arrow on a reflex. Now I've done it...

163
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,550
Quit saying you did it!

164
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,680
What're you doing?! You're the mascot.

165
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,380
What's the mascot doing here drinking?

166
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:18,670
Now I've done it... I never imagined a person would appear deep in the forest.

167
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,350
Hey! It sounds like a frightening incident is about to come to light...

168
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,770
Makoto-chan!

169
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,000
Makoto-chan, over here, quickly!

170
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,010
A group of children are leaving the temple school!

171
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,020
This is your chance! Children are pure, so it's easy to instill a good image!

172
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,640
And if they tell their parents, your reputation will grow in no time!

173
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,200
Children like cute things...

174
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,850
Time to make your appearance, Makoto-chan!

175
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,730
Wait! Do you know how heavy a past he's shouldering?

176
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,560
Hey! You're upside-down! Mako-chan! That's the wrong way!

177
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,930
That's nothing but a complete monster!

178
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,790
Look out!

179
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,600
Forward! Keep going forward! Oh no! He dropped the dead body!

180
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,850
Never mind! Never mind the dead body! Just go away! You'll just scare them!

181
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,570
I said to ignore the dead body!

182
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,860
I hate leaving school as a group.

183
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,310
Can't be helped. Not with that happening a lot lately. That's scary.

184
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,860
Ouch...

185
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,500
Hey, were we a success?

186
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,940
I wouldn't know. I'm totally in the dark.

187
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,440
Dead body! Well? Did we succeed, dead body?

188
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,170
Quit playing dead!

189
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,710
Hey, what're you guys doing?!

190
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,400
I thought something was odd.

191
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,230
So it was you guys after all! What's the big idea?!

192
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,130
No! You've got the wrong idea! Otsu-chan asked us to...

193
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,000
Shut up! You're always interfering! What's your game?!

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,070
No, it's true. Otsu-chan asked us to...!

195
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,600
14:17: You're under arrest for obstruction of justice.

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,170
What? Are you serious?

197
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,840
You can't do that! "Obstruction of justice"? Just what did we do?!

198
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,350
Shut up! You interfered with the parade!

199
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,750
Listen to me. Like we said, Otsu-chan asked us to...

200
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,360
We'd never voluntarily help you guys!

201
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Help, you say? You guys were nothing, but interference!

202
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,520
She said she wanted our help because she was going to be Chief for a day.

203
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,310
Otsu-chan hired us personally.

204
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,750
She's a fine girl. She hired us with her own money just for this day.

205
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,040
You guys are trampling on her good will.

206
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,380
You're the guys who trampled on it!

207
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,370
Okay, never mind that. Let us see Otsu-chan!

208
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,250
We're not getting anywhere this way!

209
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,940
He's right. Let us see the Chief! Today, you're nothing but a powerless gorilla!

210
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,100
A powerless gorilla doesn't exist. A gorilla's grip is nothing to sneeze at!

211
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,510
Tsk...

212
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,170
Hey Sogo, where's our Chief for a day?

213
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,530
Well... We haven't seen her at all for a while.

214
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,980
Where could she have gone?

215
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,290
Think like her.

216
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,200
When a girl disappears without telling anyone,

217
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,940
it usually has to do with number two.

218
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,340
Let it go. That's why you guys can't get girlfriends.

219
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,150
I see. Now I know why you're not popular.

220
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,550
Don't say such rude things!

221
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,040
Otsu-chan doesn't fart and she doesn't poop!

222
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,670
Everything comes out as cute little eggs! Like a quail's.

223
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,480
Do you really think of that as innocent?! It's just obscene!

224
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,860
Pop idols fart and they poop, too! Look reality in the face, you idiot!

225
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,310
Then are you saying Sis farts, too?!

226
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,690
Of course she does! I accept that!

227
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,280
But in Otae-san's case, it's a pink plume.

228
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,850
Hello.

229
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,960
You're the one who can't see reality!

230
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,950
What is it, Yamazaki? I'm busy right now. I'm hanging up.

231
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,500
Was that Yamazaki? Wasn't he working on the female serial kidnappings?

232
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,810
He wanted Otsu-chan's autograph.

233
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,600
[Otsu]

234
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,020
Don't worry. I wrote it for him...

235
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,620
More importantly, where could that girl have gone?

236
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,600
Maybe Otsu-chan was kidnapped while we weren't looking?

237
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,100
Strange how those incidents all happened within the Shinsengumi's jurisdiction.

238
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,590
Don't be silly.

239
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,100
If something happened right in front of our eyes,

240
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,380
the Shinsengumi would be finished for sure.

241
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,210
She's probably peeing or something.

242
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,920
You're no different than Kondo-san. That's why you're not popular with women.

243
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,700
Then what about you?

244
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,620
That day...

245
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,320
Shall we do a group social party next time? We'll settle it once and for all...

246
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,500
Vice-Chief, we found her. There!

247
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,950
People, do you believe the Shinsengumi is capable of protecting the peace in Edo?

248
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:30,010
No! They're just weak, lazy people who waste your tax money!

249
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,980
As proof, we easily abducted their Chief for a day!

250
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:44,080
These girls and Tsu Terakado are decisive proof of their incompetence!

251
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,130
This world is totally rotten! Let us all put a change to that!

252
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,270
[Note: Iboji is a play on the homonym that means "hemmorhoids"]

253
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,340
Currently, the radical group entrenched at Iboji Temple...

254
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:59,780
[Are the Anti-foreigner Faction terrorists behind the serial kidnappings of women?]

255
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,700
is an Anti-foreigner Faction ronin group calling itself the "Tengu Faction."

256
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,160
It has just been revealed that the recent serial kidnappings of women were their doing.

257
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,280
Furthermore, they have barricaded themselves in the pagoda with the Shinsengumi Chief for a day,

258
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,800
popular pop idol Tsu Terakado-san, as their hostage!

259
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,160
In their manifesto, they are demanding the release of their Anti-foreigner Faction comrades

260
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,640
who were arrested by the Shinsengumi and the dissolution of the Shinsengumi.

261
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,740
They claim they will kill all the hostages if their demands are not met!

262
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,710
How the Shinsengumi will respond to this situation is being closely monitored.

263
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,150
Here they come. The Shinsengumi has arrived!

264
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,710
How will you take responsibility for this incident?

265
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,140
Please tell us!

266
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,080
Kondo-san!

267
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,220
Otsu-chan was right there with you when this happened, wasn't she?

268
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,860
Didn't you see anything?

269
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,650
They're demanding the dissolution of the Shinsengumi. What will you do?

270
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:49,130
Now I've done it... I've done it. I never thought we'd be arrested.

271
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,360
Who are you? How are connected to the Shinsengumi?

272
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,180
It was a false arrest. That's what it was.

273
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,870
False arrest?! By the Shinsengumi?!

274
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,800
Won't you please tell us the details of what happened?!

275
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,180
It was more torture than an interrogation...

276
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,280
Don't complicate the situation!

277
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,630
Cut it out, you guys! If you hadn't shown up, this would never have happened...

278
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,780
Take a look, viewers. He's like a thug!

279
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,280
Toshi, stop it. If our reputation gets any worse, we'll be...

280
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,280
We can't do anything with this many people from of the media here.

281
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,760
Those guys are out to completely ruin us.

282
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,510
Everyone!

283
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,770
So the Shinsengumi are here! I hope you have prepared for dissolution.

284
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,990
What? What did you just say?

285
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,760
I'm sorry. Speak louder, please!

286
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,260
Everyone!

287
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,270
So the Shinsengumi are here! I hope you have pre...

288
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,780
Don't make me repeat myself! It's embarrassing!

289
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,910
It says: "We can't hear you. Please write it down."

290
00:16:51,740 --> 00:17:01,230
[Your writing's too small, can't read it.]

291
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,710
Listen up! Try to buy as much time as you can.

292
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,940
Units 2 and 3, use the opportunity to flank them.

293
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,850
Are you guys mocking us?!

294
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,230
Act like you can't hear them.

295
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,520
"Regarding the hostages' release, we are discussing it with our superiors.

296
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,080
But it will take time. Please wait." That's what it says.

297
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,510
Hmph...

298
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,740
They want us to believe them?

299
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,080
"We want proof. Proof that you've become our loyal dog.

300
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,890
Turn around three times and bark."

301
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,600
Those bastards...

302
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,350
It says, "Hijikata only."

303
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,460
Don't lie! You clearly tacked that on just now!

304
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,340
You have no choice, Toshi. Do it for Otsu-chan.

305
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,230
Yeah, you have no choice, Toshi.

306
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,260
I don't want you calling me Toshi.

307
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,030
Oh yes, he did it!

308
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,280
Toshiro Hijikata, the man feared as the demon vice-chief!

309
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,010
His attempt to make himself look good made it all the more embarrassing!

310
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,590
Hijikata-san, I made a mistake.

311
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,450
It actually read, "We're hungry, so prepare some curry."

312
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,870
What kind of mistake was that?!

313

[Is hot curry okay? Or mild curry?]

314
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,860
The two sentences are totally different!

315
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,390
Chief! That doesn't matter at all!

316
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,770
What a sight to behold!

317
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,160
The Shinsengumi, feared by the Anti-foregner ronin, are making curry!

318
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,530
They're completely at the terrorist's beck and call!

319
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,030
Everyone...

320
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,010
This is interesting. Maybe we can have some fun before our meal.

321

[Do the robot dance.]

322
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,550
Shit. They're getting carried away. It says to do the robot dance. Okita only.

323
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,280
Seriously? I have no choice.

324
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,100
Rocket Punch!

325
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,590
They said "dance"! That's a killing technique!

326
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,030
It's a dance that begins with a Rocket Punch.

327
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,770
He's pretty good... What's with this guy? He has no weaknesses!

328
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,330
Mimic someone. Open to all.

329
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,840
I have no choice. I'll take this one.

330
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,500
I'll mimic Okita!

331
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,600
Mimicking a fractured skull!

332
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,810
Hey, you... Seriously, come on, let me hit you just once, okay?

333
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,900
I won't hurt, so please?

334
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,030
Nope.

335
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,360
Damn rotten kid!

336
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,420
Uh-oh, there's dissension in the ranks!

337
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,960
How the Shinsengumi has fallen!

338
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,420
There's practically nothing left of it!

339
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,560
Chief! Our image is getting worse and worse!

340
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,980
Chief!

341
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,340
The Chief ran away to the land of curry!

342
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,170
Want seconds, Mako-chan?

343
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,270
Now they've done it. Those guys really did it...

344
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,420
Can't do anything about what's already done, Mako-chan...

345
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,740
Mako-chan, you can go home. We'll take care of it from here.

346
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,020
We can't do that. I'm the image mascot... Your image mascot.

347
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,600
Otsu-chan paid us in advance, so we have to see the job though.

348
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,360
What is an image mascot? Is that the image we present?

349
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,790
Like this?

350
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,120
Like how?

351
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,000
Stupid, dangerous, protectors of the peace in Edo.

352
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,260
I only see the stupid part of it...

353
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,770
Well, time to get going... Hey, ready the curry.

354
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,570
Hey, where're you going, Mako-chan?

355
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,880
Like I said. Mako-chan is your image mascot.

Cut it out! You know we can't do that!

360
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,390
Stop it, please. That's enough...

361
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,770
If you can't do it, then this woman dies in Kondo's place.

362

Hey there.

365

I've brought your curry.

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,880
What are you...?

367
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,810
I was hired part-time to be their mascot. How did I get mixed up in all of this?

368
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,400
We're having fun right now, so just go over there. Leave the curry there...

Chief! What're you doing?

373
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,910
Stop horsing around!

374
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,580
Otsu-chan! I'm sorry!

375
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:55,520
After all you did to help us, this is who we are!

376
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,390
We struggled to change, but we're still the same!

377

We're still the same, crude bunch of guys that people hate!

378
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,420
It's a crudeness we can't get rid of in just a day!

379
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,850
But! Like you said,

380
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,650
there are things we noticed as we struggled and looked at ourselves!

381
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,650
We don't care how much people hate us, or how much they laugh at us!

382
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,180
However!

383
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,150
We absolutely do not want to become shameless men
