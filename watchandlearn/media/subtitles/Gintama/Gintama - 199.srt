2
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,610
Remember!

3
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,990
Was the woman you loved meant to
stand in the rain under a dark sky?

4
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,380
Seimei-san!

5
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,300
What?!

6
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,870
Who are you?

7
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,970
Just a fan.

8
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,920
["That's How I Wish To Be,
Beautiful And Strong."]

9
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,310
Gin-chan!

10
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,250
It's still not enough!

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,260
Give me more until it's
all hard and stiff!

12
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,280
What's this?!

13
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,340
They're channeling magic
into his blade...

14
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,850
That will have no effect on me!

15
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,540
Die!

16
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,180
You've got it wrong, Doman.

17
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,140
This should be...

18
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,000
You're amazing, Seimei-kun.

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,810
You know so many spells that I don't.

20
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,820
Can't control the body...

21
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,130
The grown-ups spend
all their time fighting,

22
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,980
but I'm sure that we can
be friends, Seimei-kun!

23
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,490
Yeah. When we grow up, we
will protect Edo together.

24
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,800
We're unbeatable if we join forces, Doman.

25
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,520
It's a promise, Seimei-kun.

26
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,040
Yeah...

27
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,240
Let's get strong together, okay?

28
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,470
What are these memories?!

29
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,380
It's too bad.

30
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,800
I thought we could be friends.

31
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,070
These are... These are...!

32
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,550
I felt the same way...

33
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,750
Doman!

34
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,320
Doman...

35
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,510
Can it be? Are you...?

36
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,630
Are you restraining Antenmaru?!

37
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,520
Seimei...

38
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,800
I refuse to listen to you...

39
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,740
Sacrifice your life to end
this once and for all?

40
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,410
I refuse to let you have all the glory.

41
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,510
Allow me this final moment.

42
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,630
Lord Doman.

43
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,460
Quickly...

44
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,880
Finish me off while you can...

45
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,080
I won't let that happen, Doman!

46
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,570
A lesser being could never hold me back!

47
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,150
Do it!

48
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,060
The time has come for the
Ketsuno clan and Shirino clan

49
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,120
to join together after a
thousand years of strife!

50
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,230
Let us show him our clan's
might to vanquish evil!

51
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,890
Break free of our accursed fate!

52
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,110
Lord Doman!

53
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,780
That's...

54
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,880
Their power is gathering
into Gin-san's blade!

55
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,680
Doman!

56
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
Seimei...

57
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,960
I've figured out how to make up with you.

58
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,510
Protect Edo with me...

59
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,380
We've had incessant rain
for the past few days,

60
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,250
but early this morning, the wind picked
up and we now have a storm!

61
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,910
Battering rain and wind that make
it difficult to stand up straight!

62
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,010
The door went flying!

63
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,260
Catherine-san, it's dangerous
to go outside.

64
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,110
Tama!

65
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,410
Otose-san! Tama got...!

66
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,580
Look at this! The bridge has been
swept away by the torrent!

67
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,500
At this rate,

68
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,810
it's only a matter of time before
the rain floods the entire city!

69
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,000
The heavy clouds above Edo are

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,410
a mysterious phenomena that cannot be
picked up by our weather satellites!

71
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,900
What are those clouds?!

72
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,460
What's going to happen to Edo?!

73
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,330
Please, making such a big
fuss over a hurricane.

74
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,060
Isn't it your job to report the weather?

75
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,410
These fools will only make people panic.

76
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,410
Otose-san, help!

77
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,820
Isn't there a reporter with some nerve to...

78
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,800
Good morning.

79
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,700
I can feel your raw emotion...

80
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,190
Big enough to reach anyone anywhere...

81
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,320
Guaranteed...

82
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,090
Strong enough to cut through

83
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,030
these smothering dark clouds!

84
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,680
Stop interfering, Doman!

85
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,330
Begone!

86
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,860
Your clan has been
cursed by darkness!

87
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,810
You can never clear away these clouds!

88
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,180
The Mikado are fated to suffer
an eternal rain of hatred!

89
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,000
How is everybody doing after
the extended period of rain?

90
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,800
Are you feeling down because
of the gloomy weather?

91
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,220
Lost your cheer?

92
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,490
The skies above Edo may be rough at the
moment, but you don't need to worry.

93
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,070
Rain must eventually end.

94
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,250
Clouds must eventually part.

95
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
So cheer up.

96
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,600
Let us all wish together.

97
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,570
Our hopes will reach...

98
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,070
I just know it...

99
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,640
The sun will shine...

100
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,070
Along with our hearts.

101
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,870
Here we go!

102
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,420
Namaste.

103
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:35,230
Tomorrow will be sunny!

104
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,670
Ah, I finally remembered...

105
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,500
What I always wanted
to see, to possess...

106
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,160
But it would fade when
I tried to draw it close...

107
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,410
Never meant to be by my side...

108
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,500
Now here is the forecast for today.

109
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Today's weather is...

110
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,150
Sunny!

111
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,770
It can only be seen when
standing in the sunlight...

112
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,270
Ah...

113
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,920
Still the same as back then.

114
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,710
What a great smile...

115
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,960
Wow, they've almost rebuilt the place while
Gin-san was healing his xxxxicles.

116
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,830
A considerable job for both
Onmyoji and shikigami.

117
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,980
Nobody will be able to return to protecting
Edo for the time being.

118
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,280
Oh, then the Bakufu didn't
get mad at you?

119
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,600
Someone mentioned how you'd get in trouble
for recalling the shikigami around Edo.

120
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,100
The situation was dire.

121
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,900
If we hadn't dealt with Antenmaru,
Edo would have been destroyed.

122
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,370
So you weren't fired.
That's good news.

123
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,580
But what about the Shirino clan, the
ones who summoned Antenmaru?

124
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,020
Will they be punished?

125
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,610
Punished?

126
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,630
Why would that be necessary?

127
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,420
Nobody can be blamed
for Antenmaru's revival.

128
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,740
The seal on him had weakened
after a thousand years.

129
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,150
The Ketsuno clan and Shirino
clan cooperated to exorcise it.

130
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,000
Am I wrong?

131
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,470
Seimei-san...

132
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,160
Thanks to a certain someone going on a
rampage, he not only wrecked our homes,

133
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,760
but utterly destroyed the huge wall that separated
the Ketsuno and Shirino for a thousand years.

134
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,920
Honestly, how is he going to take
responsibility for his actions?

135
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,690
Marrying Christel and taking over the family
won't be anywhere near enough.

136
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,320
Gin-san would love to hear that.

137
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,120
Hey, you gonna force her into another political
marriage and repeat the whole tragic mess?

138
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,900
That sponge is worthless.

139
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,250
I was only joking.

140
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,110
But I believe he will return
home for the time being.

141
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,000
The entire clan will be holding
a feast in his honor.

142
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,670
Speaking of which, where is he?

143
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,100
His xxxxicles haven't been healed yet?

144
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,890
Hey!

145
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,070
The entire clan holding a feast...

146
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,390
I wish we had a chance to
share a glass with him.

147
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,830
I wish we could have showed
him this sky.

148
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,850
Oh?

149
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,440
And who might you be talking about?

150
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,290
Where are you going?

151
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,620
We can't hold a feast without
the guest of honor.

152
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,090
Guest of honor?

153
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,140
Are you stupid?

154
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,120
I said that I'm just a fan.

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,880
And if I stick around, Ms. Ketsuno
will hear about what happened.

156
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,770
You don't want Ms. Ketsuno to find out
about this huge fight over her, do you?

157
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:57,110
You came with me so you could settle the
matter without her finding out, right?

158
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,610
So you were planning to work for
free this entire time?

159
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,850
You knew that Lady Christel would never
learn of what happened, and still...?

160
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,240
Don't be ridiculous.

161
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,310
When have I ever worked for free?

162
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,320
Get this signed for me and send it back.

163
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,380
I promise to send it back.
