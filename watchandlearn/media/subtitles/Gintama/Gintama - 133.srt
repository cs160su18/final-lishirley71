[Buwahahaha, a request from your Excellency. Turn on the room lights and keep your distance from the TV when watching the show.]

3
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,200
Why? Why must this happen to me?

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,140
Did I do something wrong?

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,390
I'm forced to work in some inn for Stands. I'm told I'm useless and I'm tired,

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,170
but I can't sleep because of them playing UNO every single night.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,590
If that weren't bad enough, I've been living on rice crackers and peanuts!

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,140
I can't take it anymore.  I can't stay quiet.

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,230
I'm going to do it. "His Excellency" and crap don't matter anymore.

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,410
I'm going to crush this hot spring inn!

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,930
Brief Trio, you've double-crossed me...

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:46,220
If you want to defeat me, you need the help of the most powerful Stand.

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:53,560
But that's impossible. There isn't anyone in Senbokyo who will help you.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,790
I'm going to have you work here until you die.

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,270
The most powerful Stand. The most powerful ally.

16
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,830
Such a person...

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,770
Huh? What are you doing here?

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,250
Are you awake?

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,290
You stink. What is that smell?

20
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,380
They're in front of me!

21
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,090
Stay in here for a while to cool down, Rei.

22
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,470
I can't believe what you did. I never thought you'd double-cross me.

23
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,080
I didn't double-cross you.

24
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,300
Don't get carried away!

25
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,440
Who do you think made you stay here?

26
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,350
I wasn't working here because I wanted to.

27
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,730
Okami, you're the one who started all of this...

28
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,430
Hush!

29
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,740
We've been together for a long time, so you're getting off easily.

30
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,430
Otherwise, I would have killed you off and your little soul, too!

31
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,770
You should be thankful I had mercy on you!

32
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,140
This is wrong.

33
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,760
What?

34
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,220
I said, this is wrong. You used to be...

35
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,050
Cut it out now.

36
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,470
If you don't, I won't be able to forgive you.

37
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,750
Okami, you and this place have changed.

38
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,670
Nothing has changed.

39
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,780
In fact, we purposely tried not to change.

40
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
It's useless!

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,800
Even if you confine me in here, you can't stop him!

42
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,810
Gin... Gin will do something to save this inn!

43
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,970
[Seal]

44
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,310
Sorry to say this, Rei...

45
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,660
...he's become...

46
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,920
...a pet dog without fangs.

47
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,000
["Gin and His Excellency's Good-for-nothings."]

48
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,810
[Banquet Hall]

49
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,940
Way to go, Taishogun!

50
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,390
It's as if you were drinking in the whole country! We admire you!

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,260
Hey! Bring more sake! We need more!

52
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,220
Lord Ieyasu, have another shot.

53
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,530
Thank you, but have some yourself, Sir Nobunaga.

54
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,950
Let me pour some for you.

55
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,620
No, I'll pour more for you.

56
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,160
No, no. Let me do it.

57
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,310
Hey, bring more food and sake!

58
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,780
Boy, we're so busy.

59
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,020
Indeed. We need all the help we can get.

60
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,520
How're my young people doing?

61
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,780
Have they've been somewhat helpful?

62
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,930
I did ask you to send a lively guy.

63
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,640
But I don't remember asking for a mad dog that bites its owner, Otose.

64
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,330
Oh, is he a little wilder than you expected?

65
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,930
But I thought you needed a bulldog, not a calm little lap dog.

66
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,160
Maybe. But he continually bit me severely.

67
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,010
So, I'll only pay you half of the referral fee.

68
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,880
That's not the way I remember it!

69
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,980
That's your fault!

70
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,760
Although we were shorthanded, I sent them all to you.

71
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,800
You need to pay as we agreed.

72
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,840
You sent me a defective worker, and I disciplined him.

73
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,670
I'd say you should pay me instead.

74
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
"Disciplined him?"

75
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,680
Right! I punished him a bit, and then he became completely obedient.

76
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,890
He seems to like my place.

77
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,500
And he said he didn't want to go back to you. What should I do?

78
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,000
Wait. I told you that you could have them for only ten days.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,810
But that's what he wants. I can't do anything about it.

80
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,820
Oiwa, have you...

81
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,520
...fallen for him?

82
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,660
Otose, I can't hide anything from you, can I?

83
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,970
Where did you find that man?

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,740
He's allied himself with my most trusted worker in a short period.

85
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,000
And then he plotted to revolt against me. No ordinary man can achieve such a thing.

86
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,560
Right now he's a useless good-for-nothing.

87
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,940
But with a bit of training, he'll become a fearsome monster.

88
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,850
I can't think of anyone better to take over for me.

89
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,350
Otose...

90
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,070
Back then,

91
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,310
you stole away your husband-to-be.

92
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,080
But this time, I get to take the man.

93
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,910
He's my dog now.

94
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,980
That man will have to work the rest of his life in this inn.

95
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,440
That helps me.

96
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,190
As long as you send the woman and child back to me, it's fine.

97
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,240
You can do whatever you want to him.

98
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,800
If I can get rid of that lousy slacker who doesn't pay his rent,

99
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
then there's nothing happier than this.

100
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,970
But let me point out one thing. That man is fierce.

101
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
I already disciplined him.

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,060
Even if he wanted to bite me, he doesn't have fangs anymore.

103
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,580
Oiwa, it doesn't matter how many fangs you broke.

104
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:19,120
You can discipline a beast, but he's not just a beast. He's worse.

105
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,680
He's a wild animal.

106
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,000
Okami! Gin broke out of the punishment room and escaped!

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,520
That's what I told you. You'd better be careful.

108
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,930
Find him!

109
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,120
It would have been impossible for him to go down the mountain!

110
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,520
He must be somewhere in this inn!

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Look everywhere!

112
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,030
Gin, how did he manage to slip out of the punishment room?!

113
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,970
I trapped Rei in the spell bind cell.

114
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,680
And the others are supposed to be possessed by Stands, playing UNO.

115
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,640
He couldn't have had any help. So how did he do it?!

116
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,940
This is...

117
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,170
Don't tell me...

118
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,780
Oh, here we go, here, here.

119
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,640
Here we go, here, here!

120
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,640
This is... Why are they here?!

121
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,720
They're supposed to be possessed by Stands, playing UNO!

122
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,170
No, they're Stands?!

123
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,420
It can't be! How could they be Stands when they're not even dead?!

124
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,280
Can it be, that they helped Gin?!

125
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,560
They're living ghosts.

126
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:37,550
Being possessed by a Stand means to have a foreign spirit enter your body.

127
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,300
And because of it,

128
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,180
their original Stands rejected themselves from the body, escaping as living ghosts.

129
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,650
No.

130
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,200
Even if this place is one of the foremost spiritual sites in Japan,

131
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,810
that can't be the only reason for them to become Stands.

132
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,480
Don't tell me,

133
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,630
they went out of their way to become Stands because they wanted to help him?!

134
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,010
It can't be!

135
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,560
Oh, how fun this is!

136
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,510
This is the most fun party I've ever been to since I was born.

137
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,110
What are you talking about?

138
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,640
It's not since you were born. Don't you mean since you've died?

139
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,580
Shoot, you're right!

140
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,260
What?!

141
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,680
Lord Ieyasu has disappeared!

142
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,310
And the other guests are disappearing!

143
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,300
It can't be! That man found out how to defeat the Stands?!

144
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,550
That's right.

145
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,550
You don't defeat Stands by holding them down by physical force,

146
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,400
or to trick them by using your head.

147
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Defeating Stands means

148
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,180
sending them to heaven.

149
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
The Stands wander this world because of their regrets.

150
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,810
Only when they feel satisfied and happy can they go into heaven.

151
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,770
Yes. You don't need muscle and intelligence to defeat Stands.

152
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,380
All you need is...

153
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,010
[Sympathy]
[Consideration]
[Kindness]

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,440
sympathy, consideration or kindness.

155
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,800
The kind of things you learn in class become the ultimate weapons!

156
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,100
[Ask not until we have won the war.]

157
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,600
Everyone!

158
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,610
I won't forget any of you after you enter the afterlife!

159
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,950
May you rest in peace!

160
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm going to sing a song.

I am a thousand winds

173
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,720
Ahh! My guests are going to heaven!

174
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,770
Stop them! Somebody! Stop them!

175
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,140
[I am a thousand winds that blow.]

176
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,470
Brief Trio, go stop them! Or else all of our guests will disappear!

177
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,050
Please wait! Sir Mitsuhide has already made a stairway to heaven!

178
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:24,400
that blow,

179
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,400
What the hell are you doing?!

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,940
Come on, Mitsuhide!

181
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,610
Stop! Stop feeding me those heartwarming words.

182
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,280
Or I'm gonna come... I'm gonna come...

183
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Just go now!

184
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,150
I am a thousand winds

185
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,800
Damn it! Where did they go?

186
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,200
I hear "A Thousand Winds" from all sides.

187
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,110
I don't think I can hold it anymore.

188
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,100
Sir Mitsuhide, think of when I killed you!

189
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,180
You hate me don't you? You hate me!

190
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Sorry, but I have something to tell you before I go.

191
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,540
Will you listen to me?

192
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,890
My lord, I'm sorry about Hononji Temple.

193
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,780
Stop! Shoot!

194
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,600
Stop saying, "I have something to say before I go!"

195
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,980
Oh shit, oh shit! I'm close to tears. You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?!

196
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,770
My lord! Hold on!

197
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,010
Hideyoshi!

198
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,400
I have one thing to say before I go.

199
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,770
Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear it! I don't!

200
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,000
Please return "Armageddon" to the Tsutaya video rental store for me.

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,760
Apologize! Say you're sorry for calling me a monkey!

202
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,840
Sir Mitsuhide!

203
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,210
Sir Mitsuhide went to heaven from hearing "Armageddon"! What's going on?!

204
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,920
Hey!

205
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,390
Oh, I'm sorry. I've confused you with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

206
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,390
Ahh!

207
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,320
Jean-Claude Van Damme! He's so cool!

208
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,270
Calm down, monkey! You don't look like him at all!

209
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,530
You're completely Asian!

210
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,170
No, not you. I was referring to you, Mr. Nobunaga.

211
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,360
Ahh! He's awesome! Jean-Claude!

212
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,860
My lord! Please calm down. I'm Jean-Claude!

213
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,250
Kagura, that's enough. Let's go.

214
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,260
Should I finish it?

215
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,390
Oh?

216
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,920
You looked like a really simple guy at first glance,

217
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,890
but you're much better looking without glasses.

218
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,760
Arghhh!

219
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,710
Shin!

220
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,690
They got me! They got me, but I feel kinda happy!

221
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,680
I did it!

222
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,640
Good job, my lord!

223
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,100
Ahhh! Don't say good job!

224
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,470
M-M-My lord!

225
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,310
No! Hold on! That's enough! It's over! Hey!

226
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,920
Let's go.

227
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,050
Oh? Did anyone ever tell you that you looked like a celebrity?

228
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,940
Um, who was it? Mi Ito...

229
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Wow, sis, his words didn't move you a bit!

230
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,850
Why should they? It's the truth.

231
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,000
I am a thousand...

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,110
It's useless.

233
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,180
It won't work on my husband.

234
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,440
Is that so?

235
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,390
Actually to tell you the truth, except for the main bars, I only vaguely know this song.

236
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,750
You sure have done it.

237
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,930
Just what I'd expect from the man I've set my sight on.

238
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,140
But you did a bit too much.

239
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,280
Heh. What's wrong with sending dead people to heaven?

240
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,140
Dead people go to the afterlife. It's their natural providence.

241
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,770
Yet you keep them here for no reason.

242
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,890
What do you want to do with them, anyway, old hag?

243
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:07,570
I don't know what the deal is here, but let's stop licking on each other's wounds.

244
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,950
I'll send all of you to the afterlife.

245
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,450
Let's just see who will be sent to the afterlife.

246
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,720
Gin, I'll show you what a real Stand user is...

247
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,800
...in the worst way possible!

248
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,680
The most powerful Stand, Tagosaku, has finally shown up!

249
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,340
I can feel it even before the battle! This evil aura I feel...

250
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,330
He's totally different from the other Stands!

251
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,460
I mean, I see something like "Gogogogo"!

252
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,890
That's the same "Gogogogo" I see in that manga, right?

253
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,070
Yes...

254
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,890
My husband is not just any Stand.

255
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,520
You can't just sing and send him to heaven like everyone else.

256
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,390
He's completely different from other Stands.

257
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,660
Because he has an obsession with this world? Or a grudge?

258
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,760
No, it's because of the bond between two people.

259
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,120
For example, a lawyer and defendant, a coach and player,

260
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,490
or Guncannon and Gundam, or Tonkatsu and cabbage, or Mana and Kana!

261
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,640
Hey! The last couple of examples fall short, don't they?!

262
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,550
Humph. It means our bond is something that cannot be severed so easily.

263
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,350
Keep that kind of sappy talk to yourself, you old hag!

264
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:48,560
What? Don't you have a sweetheart? How pathetic!

265
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,670
Oh, leave me alone, you bitch!

266
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,940
I...

267
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,570
Don't take your time if you don't have any!

268
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,280
Shut up! Don't make me miserable!

269
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,050
I tend to drag stuff like this out! It really hurts me, you know!

270
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,930
Anyway, it'll be over soon.

271
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,090
No matter when or what it is, Tagosaku will protect me.

272
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,660
Ever since that time...

273
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,580
Yes...

274
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,810
He has always protected me.

275
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,660
Always...

276
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,960
Is she taking the Stand into her own body?

277
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,140
You have it all wrong.

278
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,110
A Stand user is not just about controlling the Stands as you command.

279
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,470
Being able to take in the Stand within your own body,

280
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,060
yet still retaining your own consciousness,

281
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,270
and controlling that immense power.

282
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,930
That's a true Stand user.

283
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,960
Gin, can you possibly do this?

284
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,770
The old lady's body is transforming into someone else.

285
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,680
This is...a true Stand user?!

286
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,950
But you're just His Excellency!

287
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,730
I'll turn you into a wax dummy, too!

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,060
D-Don't underestimate me, you old hag!

289
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,390
Is that it? We're just getting started here.

290
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,850
Don't tell me you're down already.

291
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,850
Just as I thought, you still have the energy left to move around.

292
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,980
So,

293
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,970
this will be the final blow!

294
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,220
Even this isn't enough to atone your sins for wrecking my inn!

295
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,390
An ignorant brat like you talking like you know it all!

296
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:18,760
It's providence that a dead person goes to the next world. Yes, that's right!

297
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,790
But not everyone can go to heaven.

298
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,720
Some people can't go there!

299
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,380
There're people who can't stop thinking about this world.

300
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,220
Or there're people who have deep scars that have yet to heal.

301
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,430
This is the only place for people like them!

302
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,220
You...

303
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,510
You have no right to take it from them!

304
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,680
If that's true,

305
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,590
you don't have the right to keep them here, either, do you?

306
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,750
What keeps them here is not their failure to go to heaven.

307
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,590
Okami, it's because of you!

308
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,220
N-No way.

309
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,570
It can't be!

310
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,560
This is...

311
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,940
This is...
