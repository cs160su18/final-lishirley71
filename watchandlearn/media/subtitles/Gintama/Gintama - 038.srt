00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,440
[Today's episode is a double-feature showcasing the "Kabukicho Snow Festival" and "Fireworks In Winter"!!]

3
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,080
[We also have a new ending song, so stay tuned!]

4
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,240
Huh? What happened? The sky is all white.

5
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,470
Huh? I'm the one all white...

6
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,410
Huh? Why am I sleeping in a place like this?

7
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,940
Huh? Has something like this happened before? Huh?

8
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,740
["Only Children Play in the Snow"]

9
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm not sure if there's an abnormal climate system this winter or what, but...

10
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,230
When it's raining, you wash yourself in an outdoor tub!

11
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,270
If it's raining spears, you'd do a bamboo dance!

12
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,620
We, as Edoites, believe that whatever happens, we might as well enjoy it!

13
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,030
So...

14
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,480
The First Chiki Chiki Kabukicho Snow Festival will commence!

15
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,120
Gin-san!

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,550
I brought some snow.

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,020
Oh, leave it there.

18
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,900
Wow, everyone is making great sculptures.

19
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,350
They're all pretty risque snow statues, though. Well, that's Kabukicho, for you.

20
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,870
We, of the Odd Jobs, are...

21
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,340
Well, this looks good... And I'll put the column in the middle...

22
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,680
Our show will be taken off the air!

23
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,200
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,520
Don't you know how hard I worked to make that ball on the left?!

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,840
What about you?!

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,120
Don't you know how pissed off the producer will be if you do something like that?!

27
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,950
Gin-chan, I made the column.

28
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,450
Whoa! What are you holding, Kagura-chan?!

29
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,020
What, Shinpachi?!

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,650
I don't know what you think this is, but...

31
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,200
This is the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon.

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,970
You said Armstrong twice! There's no way such an obscene cannon exists!

33
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,480
You're in early adolescence and you always have dirty thoughts.

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,710
So whenever you see a pole and couple of balls, you immediately imagine something nasty.

35
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,060
You're really disgusting. Don't talk to me for a while.

36
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,800
Then, what is it, huh?

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,320
Oh, you guys are here, too?

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,160
Oh, Hasegawa-san.

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,090
Please stop them. Those two are making something really...

40
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,370
Hey, isn't that a Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon?

41
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,370
It's got a very high-quality finish.

42
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,950
What?! How do you know?! Does it really exist? Seriously?

43
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,410
Am I the only one who doesn't know anything about it?!

44
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,760
It was the Dog Star clan's ultimate weapon.

45
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,220
They used it to blow up Edo Castle Tower and force Japan to open up the country.

46
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,710
What? Our country was beaten with this ugly cannon?

47
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,580
Anyway, what are you doing here?

48
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,050
Well, I've created my own sculpture for the contest.

49
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,720
I heard the winner gets a big cash prize.

50
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,720
Wow!

51
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,510
What's this?!

52
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm not sure what it is, but it looks great!

53
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,150
Well, it's nothing really.

54
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,730
I tend to get immersed in anything I do, so I couldn't stop... I call it "Flight."

55
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,910
It's fantastic! Are you the model for this, Hasegawa-san?

56
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,210
Huh? Well, I put a lot of my heart and soul into it, so it ended up looking like me.

57
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,550
This is too buff to be you. Let me scrape some off around here.

58
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,990
Hey, what are you doing?! Give me a break! That's the only thing holding it up.

59
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,990
Is this bit true to life too?

60
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,600
I wonder if that part is like DORK's, too.

61
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,990
No! You're not supposed to point out that part!

62
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,350
Hey, what dirty things are you showing to our Kagura-chan?!

63
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,280
Just a minute!

64
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,830
It's art! You see things like this in art textbooks all the time!

65
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,050
Bastard! Are you trying to get Gin Tama canceled?!

66
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,150
Hey! Watch where you throw that snowball!

67
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,010
Take that!

68
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,490
Whoa! My Dandy Outstanding Refined Knob. In short, DORK!

69
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,320
It's stuck!

70
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,200
Hey! How could you stick that dirty thing onto our masterpiece?!

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,770
They're coming! Do something!

72
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,840
[Hey, Lady. Pant pant.]

73
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,840
[How you doing? Pant pant.]

74
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,840
[Flight (crossed out)]

75
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,840
[You're pretty. Pant pant.]

76
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,120
This is great work.

77
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,580
Oh, really?

78
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,080
Hey, you two were so callous! I bet you did that on purpose.

79
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,780
No, I didn't mean it.

80
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,090
But if we had left it as it was, I'm sure the PTA would've complained.

81
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,010
Yours is a hundred times worse.

82
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,440
Hey, I just came up with a great idea. Let's add some wings. Wings.

83
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,060
Gin-chan, that sounds great! How did you come up with such a great idea?

84
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,020
Well, I don't know, but it just came to me.

85
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,210
Oh? You guys are here, too?

86
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,110
Katsura-san...

87
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,510
Oh? This is the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon.

88
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,390
It has a very high-quality finish.

89
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,910
And, how do you know?

90
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,490
Another name for it is "Running Thunder."

91
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,970
It caused "The Seven Days of Fire" during the Balkans Campaign.

92
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,760
That's not the story I heard.

93
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,280
What are you doing here?

94
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm participating just for fun.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,040
Wow! Great! It's like an amusement park!

96
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,140
Something like this should be fun for children. I hope you guys like it.

97
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,640
Hey, that's not the right way to play with it.

98
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
You mean this isn't for rock climbing?

99
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,130
No, this is a slide.

100
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,450
Don't slide with those on!

101
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,330
Hey, Zura, where're the stairs?

102
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:55,160
What are you guys, mountain goats?! And you were just on the stairs, fool!

103
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,410
Geez, the slide is all scratched up. I'll smooth it out.

104
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,280
You bastards!

105
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,200
I know! You're trying to ruin my work so that you can win the grand prize!

106
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,980
I won't let you win that easily!

107
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,660
Hey, isn't it amazing?

108
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,600
You must be a genius. What made you think of attaching a slide to this?

109
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,700
I don't know, but it just came to me. It was perspiration, uh-huh.

110
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,220
You mean, inspiration.

111
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,250
Oh, hi, Gin-san. What a surprise to see you here.

112
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,060
I swear I had no idea you were here. It's not like I was following you or anything. It's just...

113
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,350
Nobody asked you...

114
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:44,280
Huh? This is a Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon. It's got a very high-quality finish.

115
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,740
How do you even know that? You can't even see it's original shape anymore.

116
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,030
During the interstellar war between the planets Tuezzhan and Casshern,

117
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,770
this "Method Cannon" ultimately led the Tuezzhan to victory,

118
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,800
and has been long since abandoned in a storehouse.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,460
I don't care! That story's crap!

120
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,830
Are you making a sculpture, too?

121
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,260
Well, it's nothing really...

122
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,670
Oh, really? I see something that has your name all over it.

123
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,690
Don't get me wrong. Th-That's not Gin-san.

124
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,810
Um... I'm not violating Shueisha's or any publisher's copyrights or anything.

125
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,150
Its legs are far too long. Gin-chan's are shorter.

126
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,080
It's a glorification of him.

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,510
Well, that's about right. Great. It looks exactly like me.

128
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,590
I bet this will win the grand prize. I can't possibly destroy it.

129
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,480
Eh? Really? Are you giving me a compliment?

130
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,970
Well, I just said what I thought.

131
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,970
Why are his arms positioned out like that?

132
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,670
Oh, that is...

133
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:45,440
For this...and now it's complete.

134
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,800
What are you doing? Gin-san's arms! Fix them quickly! Hurry!

135
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,450
S-Sorry! Oh, my glasses...

136
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,880
I'll put them right back on!

137
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,120
What...

138
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,390
...are you doing, you dirty old geezer!

139
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,900
Why me?!

140
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,970
How strange. I thought you really were touching me, Gin-san. Sorry.

141
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,590
Sis, what are you doing here?

142
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,870
Well, the store I work at is entered in the competition.

143
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,170
Oh?

144
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,000
This is a Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,280
It has a very high-quality finish, too.

146
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,520
No! It looks nothing like it did before!

147
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,340
It looks so stupid. And there's nothing we can do with this Armstrong.

148
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,800
What? What the heck is an Armstrong Cannon?!

149
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,340
By the way, do you want to see our sculpture, Shin-chan?

150
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,750
We worked really hard on it.

151
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,610
See? Isn't it great?

152
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,130
What kind of work did the Odd Jobs do?

153
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,390
Huh? Well... Um...

154
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,970
I'm too embarrassed to say. What did we do?!

155
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,230
What is a Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon, anyway?

156
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,470
That's just porn.

157
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,530
Ah. The truth at last.

158
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,540
There's no way we'd win the grand prize, or even a prize for participating.

159
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,980
Let's go home, before we publicly humiliate ourselves.

160
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,430
Huh? Where are you going?

161
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,370
Don't you want to stay just a little longer to enjoy our snow statue?

162
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,420
What's that?! There's something weird on the snow statue!

163
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,710
Who cares about the grand prize!!

164
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,860
If I can't have it, no one can!!

165
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,830
It's all gonna melt, anyway.

166
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,500
Into oblivion!!

167
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,340
There's the pervert!!

168
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:34,180
It's futile! Even if we made a new slide, they'd just destroy it again!

169
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,350
I don't want the slide anymore! I wish all the slides in the world would collapse!

170
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,730
Oh, my! Everybody is fighting! What a mess!

171
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,860
What should we do, Otae? We'd better give up on winning.

172
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,920
Otae?

173
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,460
Hey, what are you doing?

174
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,840
Give me a break! No way will I give up! I'll win!

175
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,700
We promised to share the 100 cups of Bäagen-Dash!

176
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,680
Bäagen-Dash? The winner gets 100 cups of ice cream?

177
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,690
Hey, you've got to be kidding.

178
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,690
I worked so hard on a cold day because I thought we would get a cash prize.

179
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,260
Damn you, granny! You tricked me!

180
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,510
How dare you treat us like fools!

181
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:39,940
Otose-san, what's everybody doing? Is this a snowball fight competition?

182
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,320
Nope...

183
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,090
It's a festival.

184
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,680
You see that?! You see that?! I made those fireworks!!

185
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,230
It's a tiny bit lopsided...

186
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,870
Quit nitpicking!

187
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,100
Fireworks sparkling in the summer sky...

188
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,850
Like a flower that blooms and disappears in an instant.

189
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,080
But then... aren't we like that, too?

190
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,120
["Eating Ice Cream in Winter Is Awesome"]

191
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,290
Hey, hey, hey! What's this?!

192
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,240
This looks like snails. Is this some kind of punishment?

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,630
This may be...escargot or whatever you call it. It's a delicacy...I think. And very expensive.

194
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,850
Really?

195
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,170
Hey! That means this job's gonna be great!

196
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,300
I mean, if they start feeding us all this fancy food...

197
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,760
Idiot! Don't flip out too much.

198
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,910
They're testing us. To see if we're classy enough.

199
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,280
Look at the butler. He's smirking at us, isn't he?

200
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,450
You're right.

201
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,510
What? But... what are we supposed to do with this snail thing?

202
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,660
It's a plate! I think we put food on top like this then eat it.

203
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,610
Plate... But it's already on the plate.

204
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,680
We put a coffee cup on the plate. It's like a saucer, right? It's classy.

205
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,170
You guys are real hicks. Watch how I use it.

206
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,270
Excuse me.

207
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,780
More water, please.

208
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,370
I see. We use it to call the butler. That's why it's disk-shaped.

209
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,370
Can I have some chopsticks, please?

210
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,880
I don't think that's right.

211
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,520
Yes, it is. Because he stopped smirking. Wait? Is he crying?

212
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,650
Who's that guy? What? Some mollusk demon?

213
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,340
He's got a snail on his head.

214
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,320
Huh? Is that what we're supposed to do with it? Wear it?

215
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,620
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Odd Jobs. My mother is feeling ill and I...

216
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,210
What are you guys doing?!

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,590
I'm sorry. We're not used to this kind of thing...

218
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:04,020
That's all right. By the way, I'm glad to see you're getting along so well with my father.

219
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,390
Huh? Father?

220
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,420
Yes. That's right, he's my father.

221
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,570
The reason I called you over here is to take care of him.

222
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,000
You escargot old fart! Quit poaching my...

223
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,240
Who's an egg, eh?!

224
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:26,000
Sorry, my father hasn't been himself for some time now...

225
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,120
When he was younger, he was the greatest pyrotechnist in Edo. A master of fireworks!

226
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,880
But after he retired to take care of my mother,

227
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,990
who had become ill, something strange came over him.

228
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,660
[Note: word play on Gundam robots]

229
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,660
Junk Board Wandam. You're hairy today.

230
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,910
Hmm... He's Janno Kuso Gundam. It's a pretty name.

231
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,910
[Note: Kuso means crap]

232
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,820
[Note: Mamire means covered, so JUMP covered in crap.]

233
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,820
No, no. JUMP Kuso Mamire.

234
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,220
He sometimes wanders around at night and leaves home for a couple of days.

235
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,460
Hmm...Kuso mamire. It's a pretty name.

236
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,380
He's getting to be a handful...

237
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,730
Right. It's Michael J. Dogs.

238
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,330
They seem to be getting along well.

239
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,150
Kinda sad though. Old men... they get senile so quick, y'know?

240
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,270
Old ladies do fine after their husbands die.

241
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:14,390
But if a man's wife dies first, he usually just comes apart.

242
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,260
But his wife isn't dead yet.

243
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,580
She grew ill three years ago, so she's been bedridden.

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He stopped making fireworks to take care of her,

245
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,710
and, as a result, now he's behaving like that.

246
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,470
I bet he loved fireworks.

247
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,340
Seeing him in this light, I feel really sorry for the old man.

248
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,250
Old fart! What are you doing?!

249
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,800
He said he's going to meet his lover.

250
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,520
No way! He's already got one! Get him down before he escapes!

251
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,420
Get out of the way!

252
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,670
There!

253
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,140
You've gotta be more careful.

254
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,590
Hey, wasn't that a bit much?

255
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,070
I thought we were supposed to take care of him... not kill him.

256
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,210
Ah! He hasn't given up yet!

257
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,450
What?!

258
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,820
Why the heck is he so energetic? I thought this guy was old!

259
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,380
Hey! You're destroying the house!!

260
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,350
There!

261
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,440
Father, please stop this.

262
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,720
Mom is really sick! Can't you tell the good from the bad in these situations?!

263
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm sorry. We got carried away, too.

264
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Don't worry about it. You fought well.

265
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,450
Will you shut up, old fart!

266
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,470
From now on, Father, Mom is going to the hospital.

267
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,460
She's gotten a lot worse.

268
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,210
We can't take care of her at home anymore.

269
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,570
Then he won't be with his wife at all.

270
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,930
Father...

271
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,210
Don't you have anything to say?

272
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm going out to see my lover.

273
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,750
Good grief... I wonder if he even remembers mother at all.

274
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,390
Excuse me.

275
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,490
Please let him be.

276
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,570
I'm the one who made him this way.

277
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,740
I took away his fireworks... So please...

278
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,400
Let him make his own choices.

279
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,870
He's done enough for me.

280
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:50,700
He gave up the fireworks career he loved and worked very hard to take care of me.

281
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:57,440
But I can't stand to see him miserable because he can't do what he loves anymore.

282
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:07,200
I don't mind if he forgets about me... His mind was filled with fireworks from the start anyways.

283
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,700
There is no place for me in his life now.

284
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,740
And that's the man I fell in love with.

285
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,550
Mom...

286
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,900
Hmm, so this is the place he hides his lover.

287
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,310
That's right.

288
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,670
She's quite a special woman. We had better not interrupt them, Sakata-san.

289
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:50,570
Butler... So how do you come to be here?

290
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,870
Hey, hey! Isn't the old man just a bit too energetic?

291
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,880
What kind of position is he trying?

292
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,380
Well, that was a failure!

293
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,520
There...

294
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,260
Fireworks... Just as I thought...

295
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,180
How long have you known about this, Butler?

296
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,430
Quite a long time...

297
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:26,570
I heard that he left the house for a couple of days, but it was to come here, huh?

298
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,810
What a man! He forgets most things, but not his fireworks.

299
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,940
Fireworks are his life. They are part of his soul.

300
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,060
Even as his mind deteriorates, his great skills do not.

301
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,230
I feel sorry for his wife in saying this, but Master is an artisan.

302
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,260
And it's always made him less of a family man...

303
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,960
Please...leave him alone. Let him die as an artist.

304
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,240
You're saying that he's forgotten his wife, but the great skills he learned still burn strong?

305
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,810
That's a sad story.

306
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,390
I think humans are better than that.

307
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:10,720
Even if you lose your memory, you still retain it in your heart.

308
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,050
You never lose the memories in your head, they are still deeply entrenched in your heart.

309
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,700
That's what I believe.

310
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,070
Hey! Did you see that? Did you?

311
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,570
Shut up! Of course I saw it!

312
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,330
Why do I have to watch fireworks on such a cold day?!

313
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,810
Fireworks in winter are special and so dazzling!

314
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,560
Just watch this, all right?

315
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,510
I don't care about your new fireworks...

316
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,810
why do I have to come and watch your test fireworks?

317
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,770
I'm sure he was trying to say "Come be my bride,"

318
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,800
but he misspelled a word and it said "Come be my mound."

319
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,790
My goodness! Father hasn't changed a bit.

320
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,240
So true...

321
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,070
Aren't you cold, Mom?

322
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,550
I'm all right.

323
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:18,680
Right... that was 58 years ago today... I wonder if he still remembers...

324
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,270
Well, I don't suppose he could...

325
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,380
Matsu! Every year this date, I'll light up the sky for you!

326
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:35,570
Such a liar. That was the only time he ever did it.

327
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,280
Matsu, you said that people and fireworks

328
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,470
bloom like beautiful flowers for an instant and then fade away.

329
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,540
That may be true.

330
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,310
But Matsu, even if it's only for a moment, I want you to bloom by my side.

331
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,160
And when you fade away...do so at my side.

332
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,860
In return, I will...

333
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,000
...make beautiful flowers bloom by your side again and again.

334
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,600
Hey, Mom, look over there! Fireworks! At this time of the year!

335
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,390
It's so beautiful... Someone set off fireworks in winter.

336
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,730
There's a person who knows the very best.

337
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,110
Yes indeed.

338
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,160
It's a tiny bit lopsided, but... it's so beautiful.

339
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,620
Gin-chan! Look! Look!

340
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,440
Wow!! So beautiful!

341
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,480
Are there any fireworks festivals scheduled today?

342
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,990
Hey, are you watching?

343
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:20,840

I'm a Ramen Hunter, who travels to all the ramen shops in Japan.

346
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,310
I've fallen in love with your ramen.

347
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,520
Please teach me how to make ramen under your tutelage.
