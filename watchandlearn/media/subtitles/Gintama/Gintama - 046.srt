00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,300
Dear Kagura-chan:

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,950
How have you been?

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,030
All my hair follicles have died, but otherwise, I'm okay.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,850
As usual, I'm flying through the stars chasing Aliens.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:21,380
[Note: Earth Federation is a GUNDAM parody]

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,780
Lately, I've been mixed up in a battle

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,380
between the Earth Federation and The Principality on a planet somewhere.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,330
You're no ordinary guy, I take it. Are you a new type?

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,040
[Note: A parody of GUNDAM's zuchou vs. zentou type]

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,040
Until a while back, I was a haired-type, but now I'm a skin-type.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,840
No, that's not what I meant...

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,250
Anyway, now that I'm here, The Principality will win.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,900
Listen up! As of today, I will be in command of the Federated Army!

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,360
Everyone will shave their heads! Grow long hair and I will whack your ass!

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,110
More importantly, are you enjoying yourself, Kagura-chan?

17
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,360
Is that silver-haired guy bullying you,

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,330
or that four-eyed guy looking at you with those lecherous eyes you only see on adolescents?

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,280
My daughter is studying abroad on Earth.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,020
Seriously? You must be worried.

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,030
If anything is wrong, just let me know. Daddy will come and kill them all.

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,680
Good-bye. I'll write again.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,580
P.S.: I forget to say one thing.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,660
It's about that big dog you're keeping... You should really dump it before it turns into a monster.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,490
You're too late...baldy.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,710
And besides, no matter what anyone says, I'm never leaving you.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,230
Right, Sadaharu?

28
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,020
[Thank you to Sasaki-kun, Sekiba-kun, Nakajima-kun and Arai-kun of Sendai for the photo. That's a near perfect ice rendition of the Neo-Armstrong cannon.]

29
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,030
[But don't expect a gift; the world isn't that generous. You can have the gift of a "memory in your hearts" because we showed it on TV.]

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,130
So you see, the game scheduled for the dome was cancelled.

31
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,000
And to pay off all the damage we had to sell all our shrine property.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,450
Oh my!

33
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,070
I can't believe we have to go through all this just because of a dog.

34
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,230
And now, my younger sister and I are back to living in an apartment.

35
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,970
That's why men are just like dogs.

36
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,760
You dump 'em without a second thought, but they eventually come back to bite you.

37
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,280
Yeah, but at least dogs are smarter.

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,060
Ane-san, you've been requested. Table 3.

39
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,380
Coming.

40
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,700
Is it Mr. Kikuya again? That lech really likes you.

41
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,020
Like I said, they always come back.

42
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,070
They're really stupid. They get so worked up just because I'm a miko.

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,080
Nurses, miko, and flight attendants... The insane fantasies they have about women.

44
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,700
If they only knew that being a woman meant spending you life battling through piles of crap.

45
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,960
["Adults Only. We Wouldn't Want Anyone Immature in Here..."]

46
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,480
Boss, it's me, Ane. I'm so glad you came to s-

47
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,950
Ane-chan's here, Boss Kikuya.

48
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,050
What the hell are you doing?!

49
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,690
I was filling in for you 'til you showed up, Ane-chan.

50
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,260
But the jerk grabbed my butt. I was startled, and...

51
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,780
I'm the one who's startled! What're you doing to my customer?!

52
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry. He's not my customer, so I figured it's okay.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,240
You know damn well it isn't!

54
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,800
It's my way of welcoming a customer.

55
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,060
Look, just because that gorilla, who's always stalking you, doesn't mind being beaten up,

56
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,310
that doesn't mean you can treat anyone else that way!

57
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,720
Who're you calling a stalker gorilla! That's rude, you!

58
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,140
Otae-san, tell her off.

59
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,180
All right...get lost, gorilla.

60
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,030
No, that's not what I meant.

61
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,560
If you don't want to hear it, get out of here, gorilla.

62
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,300
No, that's not what I meant.

63
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,840
In fact, do the world a favor and get out of everywhere, gorilla.

64
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,300
No, that's not what I meant.

65
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,390
Just a minute, calm down, Ane. You're shocking the other customers.

66
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,430
Otae definitely went too far, but Mr. Kikuya is also at fault.

67
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,060
He keeps trying to turn this place into an all-you-can-grope buffet.

68
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,560
The other hostesses don't like him, either.

69
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,440
Your butt?

70
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,100
What's the big deal about getting your butt groped?

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,330
Do you know why there are two halves to your butt?

72
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,100
It's so that you won't mind if someone touches one half.

73
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,320
No, I don't think so.

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,590
If he touches your left cheek, let him touch your right!

75
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,010
Everyone knows that you're supposed to turn the other cheek!

76
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,300
Ridiculous! Our butt cheeks are vestiges of when we were all angels. They were once wings.

77
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,800
Now that's ridiculous!

78
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,870
What's with that? You being romantic? Like we were some kind of magic girl?

79
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,770
Yeah! Boobs used to be wings!

80
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,970
You got it wrong, Pal. They're left over from when we used to be living arsenals.

81
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,340
They were missiles.

82
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,930
Just what do you think humans used to be?

83
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:30,670
Okay, I'm not running a Touchy Pub here. But it's not an S&M bar, either, okay.

84
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,330
This isn't the place for enjoying sadistic shows.

85
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,650
Yes, you're right.

86
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,830
"Yes, you're right"?! What is this, the Kazuyoshi Morita hour?

87
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:41,440
[Note: A play off Kazuyoshi Morita who is Tamori, the basis for the Tamo-san in this series]

88
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes, you're right.

89
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,700
You two make me so mad...

90
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,250
So, Otae-chan,

91
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,570
I did ask for you to do a little bouncer duty on our worst drunks,

92
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,520
but I think you've gone too far with the stick.

93
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,900
[Note: A play on the word, bou = stick/rod and youjinbou＝bouncer/bodyguard]

94
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,360
I don't have a stick, I have a hole.

95
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,900
No, that’s not the issue here. Women shouldn’t say such things.

96
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,020
And as for you, Ane-chan, I realize you need money,

97
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,360
but your methods are a bit unscrupulous.

98
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,880
I’ve received many complaints from customers

99
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,410
that you dumped them after they’d given you every cent in their wallets.

100
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:19,550
I haven’t dumped them. I recycle the men who can save up enough money to crawl back to me.

101
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,290
I never heard of such a nasty recycling that was so harsh on the Earth.

102
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,110
Well, the two of you are the top girls here. I’d really like to keep you both…

103
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:40,080
but this business is not going to survive with two nuclear warheads here at the same time.

104
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,320
That’s why I need one of you to quit by the end of this month.

105
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,620
The one who’ll remain is…

106
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,230
Well, it’s just about the day when we tally monthly sales,

107
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,390
so I think the one who brings in more sales will stay.

108
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,930
He can’t be serious.

109
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,170
At a time when I’m already struggling to make a living and have to work even harder.

110
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,000
Damn that hateful woman.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,690
Who knows how many of my customers have been her victim.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,400
She’s never sold as many drinks as I have. And yet everyone adores her.

113
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,230
I’ve never liked that about her.

114
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,710
This is the perfect chance to drive her out of the bar!

115
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,030
Ane-chan.

116
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,900
I’ve gotten out of hand. I’m sorry. It seems I got us into it this whole mess.

117
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,810
I see what you’re doing.

118
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,610
I’m not blaming you. Let’s both try our best tomorrow.

119
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,920
I’m not letting you give me a false sense of security.

120
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,300
About our contest… I’ll forfeit.

121
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,080
I heard from everyone.

122
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,400
Ane-chan, they said you had to abandon the shrine you were living in and how it’s been really difficult .

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,820
And on top of that, you’re looking after your introverted younger sister.

124
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,160
I…can’t fight against you, Ane-chan.

125
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I know. I know that you work harder than anyone, Ane-chan.

126
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,640
Hang in there. I’m rooting for you.

127
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,930
What just happened?

128
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,160
That caught me totally off guard. That woman doesn’t make any sense. But…

129
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,660
I think I understand why everyone likes her so much.

130
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,540
Welcome. Two?

131
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,430
This the place? You’re sure this is the right place?

132
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,060
Hey, hey. Isn’t this place expensive? You sure it’s okay?

133
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,240
You’re from the Odd Jobs!

134
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,300
The miko hussy. You’re working here, too?!

135
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,800
Who’re you calling a hussy? What’re you doing here?!

136
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,190
Huh? I know someone here.

137
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,330
Sir, shall I call a particular girl?

138
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,810
Call Otae-chan.

139
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,610
O…!

140
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,110
Gin-san, Hasegawa-san. Right this way.

141
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,620
That bitch! She called her customers here!

142
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,620
Hot, hot, hot!

143
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,200
It’s been so long time since I’ve been in a place like this.

144
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,080
Hey, you’re gonna give us a deal, right?

145
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,240
We haven’t got much money.

146
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,910
Ane-chan says she’s really struggling to pay back what she borrowed.

147
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,100
I…can’t compete with Ane-chan.

148
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,010
Or so I want you to believe.

149
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:04,140
I couldn’t care less what happens to you. I have my own oath to restore my father’s dojo.

150
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,790
She tricked me! How could I have missed that?!

151
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,470
That bitch!

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,510
Let’s see some big money!

308
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,060
She’s right. She’s right.

309
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,190
If you need one, buy it used! I bought mine from an infomercial!

310
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,780
What? You said you bought it from a wizard.

311
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,290
I lied!

312
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,520
That’s awful.

313
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,190
I went to the main store, and anguished and anguished before…

314
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,600
You sell your shades.

315
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,570
What…

316
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,760
I said, go sell your shades.

317
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,110
And buy me a drink!

318
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,750
They’re expensive, aren’t they?

319
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,950
Get going!

320
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,310
That’s what you get for trying to act cool when you’re dirt broke!

321
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:48,130
Look at me! I live simply, so I’ve got nothing to lose.

322
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,530
You, go borrow money.

323
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,320
I’m saying, guys who don’t have any money need to go borrow some!

324
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,180
That’s why I said you punks are a hundred years too young to be playing at night.

325
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,180
Kids who don’t know when to quit can’t survive in this town.

326
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,580
My wallet’s empty, so…

327
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,410
Ane-chan, the bill please.

328
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,810
What’re you talking about?

329
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,170
Your wallet may be empty, but your bank account isn’t, is it?

330
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,930
Hurry and make a withdrawal. Or I’ll tell your wife everything.

331
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,680
Yes, you both were fantastic!

332
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,420
Ane-chan, Otae-chan. I have to say you both win the competition!

333
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,370
That was a great match.

334
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,400
From now on, let’s work together for the sake of the club!

335

00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,890
[Ah…]

343
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:43,810
[The morning sun is blinding again today]

344
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,980
Hey, What’s with the cheesy lyrics over our heads?

345
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,010
Don’t try to trick me. That’s not going to settle anything!

346
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:26,940
[Preview]

347
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,410
Wow! A monstrous guy has moved in!

348
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,740
“My neighbor Hedoro,” he looks so scary!

349
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,650
A florist by day, but he must be an alien conqueror by night!

350
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,810
The next episode… “Do Cherries Come from Cherry Trees?”

351
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,780
[Hedoro’s house shows up next door. Are those demon flowers for world conquest?]

352
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,990
[What is the fate of the Odd Jobs? Who must circulate the Neighborhood Notebook?]
