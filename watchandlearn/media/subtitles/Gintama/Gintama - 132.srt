[Buwahahaha, a request from your Excellency. Turn on the room lights and keep your distance from the TV when watching the show.]

3
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,700
All right. Congratulations. You've passed the job interview.

["Briefs Will Unavoidably Get Skidmarks"]

5
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,360
You have 40 seconds to get ready!

6
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,300
I hate dawdlers! I'm busy, too, you know!

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,160
What? What is this?

8
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,580
Looks like Otose has sent over someone quite spirited.

9
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,580
Huh?

10
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,050
Those girls weren't any good, but the kid with the glasses wasn't too bad.

11
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,110
He could see spirits, but you can't handle this job if you're susceptible to spiritual possession.

12
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,560
What job are you talking about?

13
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,880
Okami, a group has arrived.

14
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,390
Rei, this is Gin, the new guy. Pound the basics into him.

15
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,110
Gin, don't use your real name here.

16
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,330
Your name is the chain that links you to your body.

17
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,430
If they find out your name, you'll be dragged to the other world.

18
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,900
I've already been dragged into a strange world.

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,030
What is this? A different anime?

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,570
Take this too. As long as you have this, most spirits will listen to you.

21
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,020
[Persimmons and Peanuts]

22
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't overfeed them! If you understand, then go. I hate dawdlers!

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,010
Let's go, Gin. This way.

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,050
Don't talk to me so casually! What are you?!

25
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm Rei. Don't get in my way.

26
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,250
Don't talk about spirits. You're a Stand!

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
Can you really handle this?

28
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,720
We're going to have to do business with spirits...I mean, Stands.

29
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,610
With Stands? What do you mean?

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,980
You were sent here by the Okami's friend to work at this inn, right?

31
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,340
The old hag?

32
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,970
Yes.

33
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:17,080
But you need special abilities to work here, so Mrs. Oiwa was testing your aptitude.

34
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,140
Ghost...Stands come here for the hot springs.

35
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,280
She was testing to see whether you could handle working at this Stand hot spring.

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,620
Gin...you were chosen.

37
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,060
A s-s-s-s-s-Stand hot-spring?!

38
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,520
Yes.

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,620
This area is strongly magnetized, making it easy for Stands to materialize themselves.

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,710
It's what you would call a spiritual hot spot where Stands would all gather around.

41
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,180
That old hag!

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,690
I thought that it was strange for her to let us go to a hot spring. She sold me out!

43
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,020
To a Stand hot spring!

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,550
We usually get by with Mrs. Oiwa and several of us assistants,

45
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,910
but around this time, a lot of Stands come and we're busy.

46
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,780
We get people like you with an aptitude for Stands.

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,880
Wait!

48
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,200
I have an aptitude for Stands?!

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,460
That's impossible!

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,740
I almost took a crap three times just talking to you.

51
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,590
Oh no. Again!

52
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,160
You don't understand.

53
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,560
The fact that you're talking to me shows that you have an aptitude.

54
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,770
You just feel like taking a crap because you're a loser--no, you're just crappy.

55
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,300
No way. I don't care!

56
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,470
Why do I have to be manipulated by those old hags? I'm going home!

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,860
To where?

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,740
We closed off the mountain path by dropping a boulder on it.

59
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,590
And besides, if you run away...

60
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,040
I myself have "UNO."

61
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,970
Your friends will have to play UNO forever as "His Excellency."

62
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,480
Y-You bastards!

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,550
Rei, could you help me for a moment?

64
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,950
Another one!

65
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,790
Get used to it already.

66
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,880
Quickly, Rei, that customer is at it again.

67
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,080
Gin, take care of it.

68
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,890
What is that? Who is that Stand?

69
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,910
He's just been hitting that wall. He's creating poltergeists.

70
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,460
I'm so pissed off at Mitsuhide... I really can't believe that it's Mitsuhide.

71
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,710
Who is Mitsuhide? Who is that drunk?

72
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,870
Nobunaga.

73
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,420
Nobunaga?! That's Nobunaga Oda?!

74
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,390
Why is he only wearing briefs?! They're hanging loose on him, too.

75
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,990
He likes to adopt western mannerisms.

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,790
Why does he have to wear briefs of all things?!

77
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,960
There are lots of other types of western clothes he can wear.

78
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,440
There are a lot better things.

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,950
I mean come on, seriously.

80
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,910
Most people wouldn't betray me there.

81
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,370
It was right before I took control of the whole country that I grasp the situation.

82
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,950
Hey, he's totally dwelling on what happened at Honnoji Temple.

83
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,200
It happens every time he comes here. Gin, do something about it.

84
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,270
What can I do about that drunk?

85
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,500
Just do something! Old people like talking to young people.

86
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,400
You should do it.

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,910
Hey, I hear something coming from the room next door, too.

88
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,860
What is this?

89
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,050
Hey, there's someone else pounding on the walls.

90
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,180
What's going on? Is it some sort of fad?

91
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,260
Who is that? Cut it out.

92
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:19,070
I mean, come on... I took down that demon Nobunaga, so let's end it there!

93
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,980
It's all right for me to be at the top, right?

94
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,900
But nooo, he just had to start making a huge fuss about it... that damn Hideyoshi.

95
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,490
It's Mitsuhide! That's definitely Mitsuhide Akechi!

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,080
This is bad, isn't it?! Two guys who shouldn't meet are in neighboring rooms.

97
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,370
Think about where you put people!

98
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,680
And why is he in briefs, too?!

99
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,870
He was Nobunaga's subordinate so he was going along.

100
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,360
Naturally, Mitsuhide has tight briefs. They're clean.

101
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Now's not the time to be talking about that!

102
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,550
Something terrible will happen if they meet.

103
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,910
Huh? I hear something coming from the next room.

104
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,450
Again?! Oh, this is really bad. It's got to be him.

105
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,770
He's got to be Hideyoshi.

106
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,620
I'm going to kill that barber.

107
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,370
Who is he?!

108
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,430
And who's this barber he wants to kill?

109
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,850
Hideyoshi has to be here!

110
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,540
No matter how I think of it,

111
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,180
this is the time when Hideyoshi has to come out and badmouth Nobunaga!

112
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,820
A three-way standoff should form!

113
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,170
That's Xavier.

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,490
He's the person who introduced Christianity to Japan.

115
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,200
But his hair style was never popular.

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,430
How could it be?!

117
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,630
For what kind of pathetic reason is he staying here?!

118
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,580
Don't blame things on your barber!

119
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,040
Umm, excuse me.

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,350
Umm, I'm the person staying across from your room.

121
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,510
But your thumping is really noisy.

122
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,630
I can't sleep. Could you please keep it quiet?

123
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,110
Ah! He's Hideyoshi, isn't he?

124
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,900
And anyway, Nobunaga is really annoying.

125
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,630
Don't call me a monkey. You look like a catfish you know.

126
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,250
You're right! How did you know?

127
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,160
That's because his underwear is dirty! It has crap on it!

128
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,280
Hideyoshi seems like he'd have a lot on them!

129
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,430
Yeah!

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,060
Now's not the time to be analyzing this--! If the Brief Trio meet...

131
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,090
Huh? It's been a while. You two came, too?

132
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,360
Yeah. I haven't seen you in a while.

133
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,290
That's true. How long has it been?

134
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,690
Oh, they're acting unexpectedly normal.

135
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,700
Yep...

136
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,770
Mitsuhide, the last time we met was Honnoji Temple, right?

137
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,180
Really?

138
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,720
I don't really remember.

139
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,240
This is bad. Nobunaga is jumping into matters.

140
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,220
You don't remember? That thing happened?

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,210
What? You really don't remember?

142
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,150
I don't remember. I was immediately killed afterwards by Sir Hideyoshi.

143
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,560
Oh, really? I did that? I don't remember either.

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,630
Besides, Mitsuhide, the fact that you said "afterwards" means that you do remember

145
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,710
Honnoji Temple.

146
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,130
By "afterwards" I meant that thing. I meant after you told me to attack Mohri.

147
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,500
My memory is vague after that.

148
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,040
Hey, what's with this lousy conversation?

149
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,650
But Mr. Mitsuhide, you said that you were also killed.

150
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,510
That means that you knew that Nobunaga was killed.

151
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,420
Anyway, you totally killed him. I know you did.

152
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,410
Hold on one second, Monkey.

153
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,510
What? Did you just refer to me as just plain Nobunaga?

154
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,710
He did. He's always badmouthing him and it slipped out.

155
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,800
I did, didn't I? Huh? Is there anything wrong with that?

156
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,460
He's lashing back. He's pretty annoying.

157
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,520
My lord, you died, so you may not know this, but I did take control of the whole nation.

158
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,790
That's what happened, so don't call me a monkey, you know?

159
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,590
Oh? You took control of the nation. That's pretty impressive...for a monkey.

160
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,020
Huh? I'm kind of offended by that. There's no problem in me doing that.

161
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,590
You only took control of the country because you snatched it away from me.

162
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,250
You're the one who snatched it away, weren't you?

163
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,810
Besides, it wouldn't have been possible without me.

164
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,320
You want to fight?

165
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,160
Bring it on. I can take you down in one hit.

166
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,480
Anyway, I've already killed you.

167
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,080
But I killed you.

168
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,480
All right, stop right there. Hold on! Calm down.

169
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,810
Come in.

170
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,560
Welcome to Senbokyo.

171
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,850
I came again. I couldn't pass on this year as well.

172
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,650
Right this way.

173
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,890
Gin, carry the guest's bags.

174
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,790
Huh?! Oh, okay.

175
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,980
Thank you. Here.

176
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,930
The year is a waste if I don't get to this hot spring.

177
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,630
Hot springs really bring you back to life.

178
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,870
You're already dead.

179
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,970
Oh no! That's right.

180
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,880
You really like jokes about ghosts, don't you?

181
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,710
The hot spring is open at all hours of the day. You can go in whenever you like.

182
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,830
I can't wait to stretch out my arms and legs in the hot water.

183
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,340
Oh no! That's right.

184
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,740
You really like jokes about ghosts, don't you?

185
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,670
This is your room. Enjoy your stay.

186
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,070
Oh? Gin--?! What are you doing? Bring the guest's bags right now.

187
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,880
Oh, sorry. Here are your bags. Please enjoy your stay.

188
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,200
This isn't mine, is it?

189
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,790
Hey, you there!

190
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

191
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,460
Could you help me wash myself?

192
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,700
All right. Right away.

193
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,360
My back is so itchy.

194
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,640
Umm, excuse me, but where is your back?

195
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,130
What are you talking about? My back is my back.

196
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,390
Yes. Your back is your back, isn't it?

197
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,940
Huh? Did you hear something strange?

198
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,030
Not at all. I haven't done anything.

199
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,620
Oh! Do you suppose it could be that thing?

200
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,880
I might have hummed a little jazz tune!

201
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,810
Oh? You like jazz?

202
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,920
You've got good taste.

203
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,560
Anyway, get the upper right a little.

204
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,230
Upper right?! What part is the upper right?!

205
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,200
Son, imagine a drum set.

206
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,090
Imagine you're hitting the cymbols.

207
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,300
I don't know Jazz.

208
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,080
Is it this area?

209
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,330
How rude! What are you touching? That's my "C"...

210
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,490
Huh? Huh? What? Huh? "C?!" It's on the side of your face!

211
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,840
Why would you have a "C" on the side of your face?

212
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,760
You're quite the wild performer.

213
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,100
You looked like you were going for the cymbals, but you went for the "C" instead.

214
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,850
I've never seen such an extempore performance.

215
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,680
I'm going back to my room. I want to put this feeling to music.

216
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,100
Wait a second!

217
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,960
Your body's all like this! It's jazzed up.

218
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,180
Yes. It's jazzed up. That's why I want to write it down.

219
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,470
Hold on! Hold on!

220
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,320
It looks like you weren't what I expected you would be like.

221
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,020
Complaints have been pouring in. How will you clear this up, Gin?

222
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:35,320
Well, I think I tried pretty hard. I don't like Stands, but I even washed their backs.

223
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,190
Let me go already.

224
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,600
Don't be such a spoiled brat!

225
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,110
When you work, you're judged by your results!

226
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,520
If your hard work doesn't produce any results, there's no point, you good-for-nothing!

227
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,140
Who the hell do you think you are, talking so big to me, you Peanut Bastard!

228
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,330
I'm not scared anymore!

229
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,940
After working here, I've gotten used to Stands. I'm not afraid of you anymore.

230
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,490
I'm sorry for getting carried away!

231
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,450
Just leave it at that, dear. We need the help. He's better than nothing.

232
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,390
You don't have to deal with guests anymore, Gin.

233
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,640
Go to the back and do some routine chores.

234
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,220
We have an important guest tomorrow.

235
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,630
The Light of the East, the former Great Gongen,

236
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,660
Prince Ieyasu Tokugawa, is coming to our hot spring.

237
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,500
The rating of this hot spring will drop if someone like you were to appear before him.

238
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,000
You stay quiet.

239
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,480
I have "UNO."

240
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,930
Not good enough. I have a "draw four."

241
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,630
I also have a "draw four."

242
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,940
I never expected you to have such a trick up your sleeve.

243
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,340
Why?

244
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,270
Why must this happen to me? Did I do something wrong?!

245
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,430
I'm forced to work in some inn for Stands, I'm told I'm useless,

246
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,560
and I'm tired, but I can't sleep because of them playing UNO every single night.

247
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,890
If that weren't bad enough, I've been living on Kaki-pea.

248
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,740
This treatment...

249
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,350
I can't take it anymore. I can't stay quiet.

250
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,240
I'm going to do it. "His Excellency" and crap don't matter anymore.

251
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,790
I'm going to crush this hot spring inn!

252
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,990
That look.

253
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,580
I've been waiting for that look.

254
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,500
Rei...

255
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,340
When we first met,

256
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,940
I knew that you were the man who would start a revolution at this hot spring inn.

257
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,530
We Stands are worked off like a horse for small wages while the Okami gets rich.

258
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,550
I'm sick of doing things her way.

259
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,290
Gin, from what I can see,

260
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,170
you have the potential of a Stand user to rivals that of the Okami.

261
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:49,410
I'll become your Stand. So let's start a revolution at this hot spring inn.

262
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,240
Can we win against the Okami's Stand?

263
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,180
Tagosaku is the strongest Stand in Senbokyo.

264
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,550
He's the Okami's husband who passed away ten years ago.

265
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,170
Even after he passed away, he formed a team with the Okami and they've controlled Senbokyo.

266
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,120
The ordinary Stands and I can't take them on even if we grouped together.

267
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,650
But we need evil spirits to fight evil spirits.

268
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,280
Awaken.

269
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,860
Heroic spirits who have left their mark on history...

270
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,650
Now is the time to awaken.

271
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,390
Turn your desire for revenge into a blade and rise up now.

272
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,400
Brief Trio.

273
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,170
Good morning, Nobunaga, Mitsuhide, and Hideyoshi.

274
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,920
Who the hell are you?

275
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,540
Ieyasu is here.

276
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,280
Listen, Nobunaga...

277
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,390
Hideyoshi, Mitsuhide...

278
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,350
Do exactly what I told you to do yesterday.

279
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,150
Play a lot of nasty tricks on Ieyasu and ruin his welcome.

280
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,040
The rating of this inn will crash into the ground and the inn will be destroyed.

281
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,920
You got that?

282
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,900
Hey, are you listening? Hey!

283
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,510
You want to fight?

284
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,770
What did you say?

285
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,050
Come to the bathrooms later.

286
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,140
Let's do it right now.

287
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,370
Right here.

288
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,270
Hey! I told you not to fight anymore!

289
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,580
Come on. I'll give you some peanuts.

290
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,250
I know that a lot happened in your pasts,

291
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,560
but you can't move forward if you keep looking back.

292
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,210
Forget everything for today.

293
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,040
Let's forget all about Honnoji Temple.

294
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,280
Just focus on Ieyasu.

295
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,530
He took control of the nation after you guys weren't around,

296
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,060
even though he was the least remarkable of any of you.

297
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,830
Your true enemy is Ieyasu! Okay?!

298
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,900
All right! Then let's do this. Let's all apologize to each other.

299
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,280
Let's call it all even. Okay?

300
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,740
Come on. Okay?

301
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,240
My lord...I'm sorry for betraying you.

302
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,010
That's good! Good job, Mitsuhide!

303
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,750
The one who apologized first is the most admirable!

304
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,490
And you forgive them, Nobunaga.

305
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,140
It's all right. It didn't really bother me.

306
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,780
That's good! You did well, too, Nobunaga!

307
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,890
It's pretty hard to forgive the person who killed you.

308
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,490
Hey, what are you doing, Hideyoshi?

309
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,050
Hurry up and apologize to Mitsuhide!

310
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,330
I don't want to. I didn't do anything wrong.

311
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,750
I just killed Sir Akechi to avenge my lord.

312
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,050
What's wrong with this guy? He's really annoying.

313
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,830
Grasp the situation. You even have crap on your underwear!

314
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,550
Fine. Then I take back my forgiveness.

315
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,620
Look at that, Hideyoshi!  This is your fault.

316
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,500
You even have skidmarks on your underwear.

317
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,900
I don't want to.

318
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,260
Then apologize to me for calling me a monkey.

319
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,030
What's wrong with calling a monkey a monkey, Monkey?

320
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,610
Aw, Nobunaga, you mustn't lay hands on him. Or your feet.

321
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,210
I told you to stop.

322
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,870
Here. Some peanuts.

323
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,540
It looks like it'll be difficult for them to make up.

324
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,700
Oh well. They'll come around.

325
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,910
Anyway, keep watch over the bath.

326
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,340
Everyone becomes defenseless in the bath.

327
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,380
A surprise attack, huh? It reminds me of Honnoji Temple.

328
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,230
No, Okehazama.

329
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:29,050
Anyway, you really aren't sorry, are you? "It reminds me of Honnoji Temple". I don't want to remember that.

330
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,700
Shh... Be quiet!

331
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,640
Hey, someone's come.

332
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,430
It's Ieyasu! That's Ieyasu. There's no mistake.

333
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,270
Look at that.

334
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,720
As expected, the underwear of the guy who took control of the nation is really something else.

335
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,630
He's wearing boxers. His underwear is one grade higher than yours, fashion-wise!

336
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,070
On that note, your underwear is dirty. It's no wonder you couldn't control the nation.

337
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,810
I took control of the nation.

338
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,740
There's nothing for you to take.

339
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,230
Clean the crap off of your butt before you take control of the nation, stupid.

340
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,550
Gin, there he goes. What should we do?

341
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,740
Hideyoshi.

342
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,490
Yes?

343
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,970
Switch your crappy underwear with the boxers that Ieyasu took off.

344
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,030
Are you serious? I don't want the underwear that an old guy like that wore.

345
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,430
The guy who'll wear your underwear will hate it ten thousand times more.

346
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:14,040
Wait. It's not fair for only Hideyoshi to get boxers. I'll go.

347
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,790
What are you doing?! We don't need your somewhat clean underwear.

348
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,740
No, I will...

349
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,060
No, I will...

350
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,020
No, I will...

351
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,790
You're fighting over some old guy's underwear. That's gross!

352
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,370
Gin, Ieyasu has gone into the tub.

353
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,330
All right! Charge. Go fart in the tub.

354
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,650
Are you serious? Give us a break.

355
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,100
I got some nice boxers. Do I have to get them soiled already?

356
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,580
They're already soiled.

357
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,550
There's a streak of crap on it. How dirty is your butt anyway?

358
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,010
Hello. The water's nice, isn't it?

359
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,410
It sure is.

360
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,310
Listen. Do it together when I count to five.

361
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,110
Do it with the expectation to bear fruit. Got it?

362
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,420
Five...

363
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,810
Four...

364
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,970
Three...

365
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,730
Two...

366
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,420
One.

367
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,990
I-Impossible... This is...

368
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,110
Brief Trio, you've double-crossed me...

369
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,660
Gin!

370
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,780
Rei, it's not good to have extravagant delusions and swindle men.

371
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,940
Do you want the man you love to die instantly?

372
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,490
Too bad, boy.

373
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,620
The Brief Trio have been under my control for quite some time now.

374
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,660
Don't think I'm your ordinary Stand user. If you make enemies with me...

375
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,730
You're pretty much fighting this whole village.

376
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,230
If you want to defeat me, you need the help of the most powerful Stand.

377
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,940
But that's impossible.

378
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,260
There isn't anyone in Senbokyo who will help you.

379
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,180
I'm going to have you work here until you die.

380
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,440
The most powerful Stand. The most powerful ally.

381
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,630
Such a person...

382
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,150
Huh? What are you doing here?

383
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,000
Are you awake?

384
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,950
You stink. What is that smell? A fart?

385
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,830
They're right before me.

386
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,010
[To be continued]

387
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,870
[Next week, Gintoki...]

388
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,310
[...counterattacks!!]

389
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,180
The next episode: "Gin and His Excellency's Good-for-nothings."

390
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,760
[Gin's requiem reverberates throughout the demonic inn where spirits gather!]

391
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,970
[And finally, a direct confrontation with Tagosaku, the most powerful Stand?!]
