If a samurai is a dog, then a Shinobi is a cat.

9
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,980
A dog is loyal to his master.

10
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,770
They're loyal, faithful, and have a sense of duty.

11
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,230
A dog will sacrifice his life for the sake of his master.

12
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,450
He takes pride in living an honorable life.

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,260
However...if he loses his master, he also loses his path in life.

14
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,710
Cats are different.

15
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,800
As long as it's kept fed, a cat will call anyone master.

16
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,990
Ours is neither a beautiful nor ugly life. In it...

17
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,930
we are only attached to our skills as Shinobi.

I know I asked for Porraginol. But this one's the cream!

Really, even Shinobi are jerks.

96

After living in the regular world away from the secluded world of the Shinobi for so long...

97

I'm painfully aware of just how terrible the Shinobi world was.

You knew I was coming yet you didn't run away.

107

I'm very commited when it comes to completing a job.

113
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,420
I have the power of divination and can foresee many things.

114
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,620
But I cannot predict what will be in the next issue of JUMP.

115
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,240
Oh, really?

116

[Note: A manga serialized in SHONEN JUMP.]

117
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,420
I didn't foresee this. I didn't see that Maison de Penguin would end.

118
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,620
Is that what you meant?

This is so much fun.

120
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,220
Say, can you bring me another one next time?

121
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,020
I'm rarely allowed to go out, so I can't go buy it.

122
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,770
The next time I come, it will be to kidnap you.

123
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,440
Let's see. I'd like a Shojo manga next time.

124
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,440
[Note: Shojo manga is manga created for the young girl audience.]

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,350
Shojo manga have been pretty extreme lately, so the nannies only let me read JUMP.

126
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,440
You're not gonna run away?

127
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,950
It's useless to run away, right?

128
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,940
I don't need clairvoyance to see what's coming next.

129
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,840
To see what lies in my future.

130
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,760
No matter where I go, I cannot escape.

131
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,390
I've grown accustomed to being used, as well as foreseeing it.

132
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,280
Wherever I go, the same future awaits me.

133
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,340
This power...I wish I never had it.

134
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,000
Okuni-sama!

135
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,740
Okuni-sama!

136
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,230
Oh, it's my nannies. You'd better go.

137
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,810
It'll be troublesome if they see you.

138
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,090
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

139
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,320
Oh wait...

140
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,710
It's a promise. Next time bring me a Shojo manga.

141
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,180
And so, I've been sensing an unknown shadow near Okuni-sama lately.

142
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,180
I think it's highly unlikely, but there's a possibility that it's an assassin.

143
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,300
And you want to hire the Odd Jobs as her bodyguards?

144
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,990
Precisely.

145
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,610
Sure, if you're gonna pay us,

146
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,020
we'll do anything whether it's babysitting a kid or taking care of the elderly.

147
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,990
But just who is this Okuni-sama?

148
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,670
Okuni-sama is a special child who can foresee the future.

149
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,670
Seriously?

150
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,840
She can predict the future? Then let's ask her to foretell our future!

151
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,820
We just want you to guard her!

152
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,850
I do not need to be protected!

153
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,090
Okuni-sama!

154
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,690
How can you say you don't need any protection?!

155
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,360
We are only thinking of your safety!

156
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,260
She's...?

157
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,740
She's still so young. She's probably never even fallen in love.

158
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,380
Neither have you.

159
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,860
Misfortune will befall them if they get involved with me.

160
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,440
What are you saying?!

161
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,890
Now hurry and return to your room.

162
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,000
Hold it!

163
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,760
If you can really foretell the future, predict something right now!

164
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,050
You are right. You there, with the glasses, watch your head.

165
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,420
Huh? Me?

166
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,070
Whoa!!

167
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,430
She was right!

168
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,090
What was that?! You just hit me because of what she said, didn't you, Kagura?!

169
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,510
I'm serious this time.

170
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,750
Okuni-sama, what must I do to acquire hoards of money?

171
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,500
Do not worry. You will get it immediately.

172
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,650
Immediately...?

173
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,270
Stop your foolishness!

174
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,270
And start guarding Okuni-sama 24 hours a day!

175
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,240
Here...

176
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,560
For your services.

177
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,680
No kidding!

178
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,180
Remember that I told you.

179
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,690
Nothing good comes from getting close to me!

180
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,950
Oh, sorry.

181
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,240
You're too close to me!

182
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,230
No, since we don't know what might happen.

183
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,800
We will protect you wherever you go!

184
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I'm going to the toilet. Let me at least go there alone!

185
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,730
Okuni-sama is heading for the toilet. Over!

186
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,010
Roger! She will arrive at the toilet in twenty seconds. Over!

187
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,450
Meaningless dispatches. This is so unnecessary.

188
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,730
Okuni-sama just made a retort. Over.

189
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,050
Roger. She will look exasperated from now on. Over.

190
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,170
It's not necessary to report every little thing.

191
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,590
Before she could look exasperated, she made another retort. Over.

192
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,100
Goodness, I can't endure this!

193
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,870
All green. Please make your way to the toilet.

194
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,260
What kind of trap can be set in a toilet?

195
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,650
Well, just when you're relieved, it goes kaboom.

196
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,180
And when you do a number two, it goes kaboom once again!

197
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,220
No, a little girl would never go kaboom.

198
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,660
How about bakyuun then?

199
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,410
What kind of doo-doo is that?!

200
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,790
Oh no, you've made me say "doo-doo"!

201
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,810
Okuni-sama, your dinner is ready.

202
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,320
Please eat your fill.

203
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,420
Not you three!!

204
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,560
No, we're just testing it for poison! This is part of our job.

205
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,690
He's right! We're just taste-testing it, that's all!

206
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,430
Seconds on this!

207
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,790
You're eating it all up!

208
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,960
And you're asking for seconds!

209
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,670
What're you saying?! The poison might not be limited to what's here!

210
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,720
Don't use soy sauce!

211
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,910
It's an insult to the chef!

212
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,250
Who cares about the chef?! The taste is too bland, stupid!

213
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,080
A deep-fried dish without soy sauce on it is like

214
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,240
Machiko Sensei without her skirt flipping up, stupid!

215
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,450
[Note: Machiko Sensei is an anime about a young, pretty teacher who wears a red mini-skirt; with lots of panty shots.]

216
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,850
Times have changed, idiot!

217
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,450
Consider what it would mean for the TV station, you idiot!

218
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,910
What's wrong with panties?! We've done our share of revealing too!

219
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,670
What are you talking about?!

220
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,200
Zenzo, you must've left a scent behind. Now that kid has bodyguards.

221
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,940
Humph, not to worry. We're proceeding tonight, as scheduled.

222
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,440
Gin-chan, I'm so sleepy.

223
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,760
Too bad, Kagura-chan. This is work.

224
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,470
Still...

225
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,410
That girl reads the same issue of JUMP over and over again.

226
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,060
Listen, Shinpachi...

227
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,450
JUMP is a magazine you must read over and over again...

228
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,950
because you can't control yourself.

229
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,950
No kidding?

230
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,980
That's just like grown-up love where you have a wife,

231
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,610
but keep meeting your lover over and over again.

232
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,250
No. That's Shonen JUMP, so it's totally different from grown-up love.

233
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,890
Well, it can't be much fun reading it when you already know the ending.

234
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,980
Still, for some unknown reason, it's fun.

235
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,610
That's why it's easy to read it over and over again.

236
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,880
It's like doing bad on a test, but you can't wait until you get the test back.

237
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,450
You know...like when you mess up a math problem,

238
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,590
but wonder if maybe you got it right, after all.

239
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,320
Huh? Maybe that's not right.

240
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,320
Hey, don't go to sleep.

241
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,280
I understand.

242
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,150
Huh? You agree?

243
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,950
I mean the teacher might have made a mistake while grading.

244
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,360
Even if I know how things end, if I can enjoy the journey there, I should be happy.

245
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,950
Oh, that's what you meant?

246
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,300
And besides, manga endings are always pretty obvious.

247
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,600
Sort of like "our battle is just beginning."

248
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,610
It's never the way I hope it would end.

249
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,900
However, that doesn't make me sad. It's just like living.

250
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,620
Living, eh?

251
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,660
You're right. Manga endings might always be the same.

252
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,970
Don't you agree?

253
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,820
However...

254
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:32,280
When it comes to life, neither you nor I are mere readers. We're the writers.

255
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,760
We can change...

256
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,070
the ending.

257
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,890
Crap, I'm such a worthless guy.

258
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,360
This power...I wish I never had it.

259
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,330
It's not that I don't think it's tragic.

260
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,800
It's not as though I don't want to help her.

261
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,100
However, when my body moves faster than my thoughts...

262
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,260
When my emotions disappear...

263
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,080
and my body becomes a mere tool with which to carry out a job...

264
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,020
When my body melds into the darkness...

265
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,870
I feel truly alive.

266
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,270
I am a cat to the core.

267
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,210
Impressive.

268
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,360
No wonder he was once the leader of the Oniwabanshu.

269
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,450
He singlehandedly took control of the mansion.

270
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,020
There's no need for us to get involved.

271
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,260
No...

272
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,960
Okuni-sama!

273
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,710
Intruders in the mansion!

274
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,770
I know.

275
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,610
Huh?!

276
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,290
Gin-san!

277
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,980
No problem. If they come here, we'll fight them.

278
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,930
Newspapermen or dairymen, we'll take care of them.

279
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,220
Oh... You're very confident.

280
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,090
Hey, hey, what brings you here at this hour?!

281
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,590
Are you laundry men?

282
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:21,200
[Note: Refers to the "Kato-chan Ken-chan Gokigen TV" which featured funny home videos similar to America's Funniest Home Videos.]

283
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,950
Want me to call you Ken-chan?

284
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:21,200
That girl is Okuni the Clairvoyant. She is coming with us!

285
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,690
Okuni-sama!

286
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,160
Huh? You came to collect her? So you just barge into someone's house like this?

287
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,700
[Note: Refers to NHK - national television station bill collectors who make home visits to collect fees.]

288
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,070
I didn't pay.

289
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,950
But I don't watch your programs.

290
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,700
If you won't listen, then we'll just use force. Get them!

291
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,150
Take me where you will. I'm prepared.

292
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,140
First, I want to ask you a question.

293
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,240
Your power of clairvoyance... I want you to foretell something for me.

294
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,880
There!!

295
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,890
Zenzo-dono, she is the clairvoyant...

296
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,120
What...is this?!

297
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,740
What are the odds of me winning if I betray those guys and come over to your side?

298
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,130
St...

299
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,630
Stop. Or you'll die!!

300
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,370
Sounds good. That'll make fighting them more worthwhile.

301
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,990
You traitor!

302
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,090
Never mind me. Make your escape!

303
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,050
Escape? Where? Are there some things you can't see?

304
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,150
Zenzo, you haven't changed at all.

305
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,040
You are a pitiful man who cannot live unless it's amidst death.

306
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,970
I know what you're like.

307
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,490
And I know to be cautious when dealing with an extremely sharp sword.

308
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,240
Sorry, Saizo. Cats are fickle creatures.

309
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,980
Zenzo, you're not a cat. You're a cat monster!

310
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,500
As expected from someone who injects medicine up his butt everyday.

311
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,210
Your aim is perfect.

312
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,220
I don't inject it! I use suppositories!

313
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,950
Whatever, whether it swells or bursts, you still have hemorrhoids!

314
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,570
And depending on the location and condition, the pain and the treatment differ, you idiot!

315
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,930
Besides, what're we talking about?!

316
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,930
I know you've suffered a lot from the pain of hemorrhoids. Of course, you know the treatment!

317
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,480
Is that all I am to you?! Hemorrhoids?!

318
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,840
Damn right!

319
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,970
Did you see that? Our attack will surge forth upon you like an overflowing toilet.

320
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,950
Get away from my ass!

321
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,910
This is it, Zenzo.

322
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,620
Ah...

323
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,040
Give it up. You can't change this ending.

324
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:32,870
When it comes to life, neither you nor I are mere readers. We're the writers.

325
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,780
We can change the ending.

326
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,620
I don't know about that.

327
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,600
However, I'm happy if the action is hot like in JUMP.

328
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,020
You fool! Pray that the netherworld has bidets!

329
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,620
You idiot...

330
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,530
I told you...

331
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:21,610
You can't change what I see... There's no ending you can change!

332
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,840
There is.

333
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,410
Wha... N-No way...

334
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,780
...H-How...?

335
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,010
Sorry. It got cut.

336
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,270
[Note: This manga, Ribbon, is a very famous Shojo manga magazine.]

337
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,970
You won't be able to read it anymore.

338
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,510
I'll say it over and over again. A Shinobi is a cat.

339
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,350
As long as he's fed, he'll follow anyone.

340
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,690
And he'll do rotten things without a care in the world.

341
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,690
Some may say we've sold out our honor.

342
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,770
But we adhere to certain rules others can't understand.

343
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,420
And so, the cat will be out on the prowl again tonight.

344
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:22,070
[Preview]

345
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,900
What? An undercover report on Zura?!

346
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,070
How dare you leave me, the star, out of this?!

347
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,790
Fine, I'm not an Announcer Hananoana fan anyway. I'm a Ketsuunoana fan.

348
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,790
[Note: Word play on ketsunoana (the female announcer) which means asshole.]

349
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,810
The next episode... "Eating Nmaibo Can Make You Full in No Time!"

350
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,810
[Note: Spoof of Japanese snack "Umai Bo." A popular stick snack that comes in many different flavors.]

351
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,680
[Huh? Isn't Katsura growing his hair really fast? Some people think he's wearing a wig.]

352
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,060
[You'll lose your hair if you keep worrying about small things like that. By the way, his nickname is Zura, not Tsura.]

353
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,060
[Note: A word play. Refers to the Japanese alphabet sounds "Zu" and "Tsu" which often sound similar. And Zura means wig.]
