[This episode comes from an end-of-the-year
Christmas story that ran in JUMP over New Years.]

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,030
[The dream of the girl Kagura was playing came true.
He was the real Santa Claus!!]

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,820
The very first very merry contest to determine
who the real Santa Claus is!

5
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,380
Who's up first?

6
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,670
I'll go.

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,420
I promise to become Otae-san's Santa.

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,610
Okay, stand by then.

9
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,260
Boss lady, can you play
the part of mother?

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,230
Then I'm playing the father?

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,010
This is a little embarrassing.

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,650
I'll never accept Hasegawa-san
as my brother-in-law!

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll do it then.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,650
No, I will.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,280
You're supposed to be Santas!

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,450
And what am I playing?

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,450
["Everybody's a Santa"]

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,000
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Christmas!

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,040
All done!

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,500
Mommy, I'm done decorating
the Christmas tree.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,740
How wonderful!

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,220
It was worth the effort!

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,900
This is a common household that
you could find in any country.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,440
How is this a common household?!

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,170
And why am I the tree?!

26
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,980
We were having another common
and peaceful Christmas.

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,290
What are you two standing like
a freeze-frame shot for?!

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,070
It's annoying!

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,570
I couldn't move if I wanted to!

30
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,460
Mommy, I'm sure that Santa
will come this year!

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,410
He might not come to visit a little girl who sneaks
a bite of a meat pie that's for the party.

32
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,400
Geez, Mommy!

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,660
It was only a joke.

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,880
I'll keep it a secret from Santa.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
This is annoying!

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,850
Oh, come on!

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,060
Stop pretending to be all American!

38
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,720
Oh, you're so hopeless.

39
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,680
Go to sleep and wait for Santa!

40
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,170
You can't blame her!

41
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,180
Since Mommy's meat pie
is the best in Texas!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,530
We're in Texas?!

43
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,520
I'd love to let Santa try some!

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,420
Oops, if he puts on any weight,
his reindeer will complain to us!

45
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,100
Her daddy's annoying too!

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,230
The whole family's being
witty and annoying!

47
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,670
Look, Mommy!

48
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,620
There's a cockroach eating
your meat pie!

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,960
Oh no!

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,580
He's a cockroach?!

51
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,440
What sort of witty cockroach is this?!

52
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,430
Wasn't he supposed to be the father?!

53
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,020
Must be the head of all
those cockroaches!

54
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,170
The cockroach daddy?!

55
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,370
Why is he even here then?!

56
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,290
Where's the real daddy then?!

57
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,640
Let us offer this pie to Daddy.

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,190
Why is there a Buddhist altar in Texas?

59
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,460
Daddy loved his meat pies!

60
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm sure he'll appreciate this!

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,480
How could he?!

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,530
It's a cockroach pie now!

63
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,000
My daddy was a hero in Petnam.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,400
On Christmas Day five years ago, I didn't
receive the present I asked for.

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,060
Instead, I received notice that Daddy
had been killed in action.

66
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,420
Say, this is starting to sound
unnecessarily depressing.

67
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,490
In the middle of battle, something
fell from Daddy's pocket.

68
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,550
He returned for it, only
to be riddled by bullets.

69
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,340
Daddy's corpse was beyond recognition,
from all the pie...

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,210
That was just a pie-throwing contest!

71
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,390
How was he killed in action?!

72
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,400
What kind of hero was your daddy?!

73
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,970
Daddy's pie-covered hand was clutching his
present for me, the meat pie I'd asked for.

74
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,810
Another pie?!

75
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,740
Isn't that enough?!

76
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,580
If you think that mentioning meat pies makes you
sound American, you're completely wrong!

77
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,790
This will be the fifth Christmas since.

78
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,120
I still haven't gotten my chance
to eat that meat pie.

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,460
Of course you can't!

80
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,480
It's all looking like the Sea of
Corruption from "Nausicaa"!

81
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,960
I knew the truth all along.

82
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,650
It won't matter if Santa comes,

83
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,460
I can no longer have what I want.

84
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,950
What the hell do you want here?!

85
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,830
What present is Santa supposed
to bring you?!

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,530
The next morning, the
girl woke up to find...

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,550
That her meat pie, a memento
of her father, had been eaten.

88
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,690
Oh my god!

89
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,140
How awful!

90
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,400
We've been visited by a thief, not Santa!

91
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,150
The worst possible morning.

92
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,150
Wow, I don't believe this!

93
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,590
Jesus Christ!

94
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,600
The worst possible Christmas.

95
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,500
Goddamn it!

96
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,900
But oddly enough, she felt at peace.

97
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,410
I don't believe it!

98
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,410
Like a curse had been lifted from her.

99
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,410
Like her father had given
her a push to move on.

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,600
God must have eaten the pie for her.

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,920
The girl chuckled as she pictured
God getting an upset stomach.

102
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,740
But it hadn't been eaten
by God or even a thief.

103
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,170
["Merry Christmas"]

104
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,280
Santa Claus?

105
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,390
The hell?!

106
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,090
How is that a present?!

107
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,830
You don't understand the agony I endured
to release her from her suffering?

108
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,090
You released a whole lotta crap
in the toilet, that's what you did!

109
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,740
That was me leaving a calling
card like in Cat's Eye.

110
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,260
[Note: From the manga series "Cat's Eye."]

111
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,260
We don't want a cat's crap!

112
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,860
What's the judge's opinion?!

113
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,820
6 points!

114
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,920
30 points!

115
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,640
Death?!

116
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,770
Otae-san, what's with that?!

117
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,350
Until death do us part, right?!

118
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,740
That must be it, right?!

119
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,450
Kagura-chan, why did you give
a relatively high score?

120
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,450
The lead heroine performed admirably.

121
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,450
I'm interested in seeing
her perform more.

122
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,320
That was you!

123
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,350
Hasegawa-san, isn't the highest
possible score a 10?

124
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,650
Why did you give him a 30?

125
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,680
If there's one cockroach around,
there's thirty more hiding.

126
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,780
Is that some kind of warning?!

127
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,090
Who needs thirty old men!

128
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,020
Okay, I'll go next.

129
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,050
We'll need you to stand by again.

130
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,230
Say...

131
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,380
Can I get a better role this time?

132
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,460
Would you like a pachi?

133
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,290
Please, just one is enough.

134
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,110
Would you like a pachi?

135
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,820
I'm just a common little pachi girl
that you could find in any city.

136
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,100
The hell is a little pachi girl?!

137
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,830
Today is Christmas Eve.

138
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,120
Everyone walking around
town looks so happy,

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,540
but I'm selling pachi here, as always.

140
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,600
I have to in order to stay alive.

141
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,690
Could you explain what
you mean by a pachi?!

142
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,810
Would you like a pachi?

143
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,480
No thanks.

144
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,860
Would you like a pachi?

145
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,000
That stuff is worthless.

146
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,940
And once again, I wasn't able
to sell any pachi today.

147
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,300
This is kinda depressing!

148
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,430
Not to mention Sis is
playing every other part!

149
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,500
I won't be able to go home now.

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,220
If I go home, he'll just...

151
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,020
I said that I won't let you in until
you've sold all those pachi!

152
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,810
Go make me more beer money!

153
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,330
Useless girl!

154
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,620
I see, your worthless old man
is working you to the bone.

155
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,260
You won't be able to go home then.

156
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,610
No more...

157
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,430
I don't want to go back to
a roach-infested house!

158
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,840
Again?!

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,210
It's cold...

160
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,390
I desperately tried to sell pachi as
I slowly freeze in this weather,

161
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,240
but my body would no longer move.

162
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,390
Which one of us looks colder here, huh?!

163

To keep myself from drifting off,
I decided to use one pachi.

It's wrong to use merchandise,

forgive me this one sin.

keep yourself warm?

Okay, sure.

all warm and fuzzy.

doing something so cold-blooded?!

And then something odd happened.

177

Every time I used a pachi, all kinds of dinner
dishes appeared on a Christmas table.

It may have been a hallucination.

I kept using pachi.

with two or three of them.

At this rate...

322
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,930
I would like to introduce the
new transfer student.

323
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,810
I'm Santa. Nice to meet...

324
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,270
Ah!

325
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,860
You're the guy from earlier!

326
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,410
That event won't happen!

327
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,570
What's with the parade of cliches?!

328
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm the only transfer student they need!

329
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,940
Don't give me that crap!

330
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,550
I'm the transfer student!

331
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,610
Okay, I'd like to introduce some new friends
who are going to be joining us.

332
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,630
I'm Gin-Santa.

333
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm Ol'Santa.

334
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,530
Damn, couldn't lose him.

335
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,310
Oh well.

336
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,720
At least I wasn't late...

337
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,950
I'm Kondo-Santa.

338
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,630
I'm Kyu-chanta.

339
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,070
I'm Sa-chan.

340
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,920
Everybody get along.

341
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,440
How many transfer students are there?!

342
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,640
And one of them is completely sticky!

343
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,710
Pleasure.

344
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,240
Hey, is there anybody you like?

345
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,900
This classmate is also sticky!

346
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,600
What's wrong with Class 3-G?!

347
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,140
Bastards...

348
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,810
They still haven't given
up on being Santa?

349
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,650
But it's too late!

350
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,270
I've already met Kagura once.

351
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,130
We're already tied together by destiny.

352
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,990
Young girls are suckers for destiny.

353
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,140
Oh! It's you!

354
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,090
See?

355
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,650
You've showed yourself
again, damn cockroach!

356
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,520
Him?!

357
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,180
He introduced the transfer students,
but he's still a cockroach?!

358
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,490
He's been bugging me
since I was in Texas.

359
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,560
Such a drag...

360
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,490
Texas?!

361
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,110
These stories are tied together?!

362
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,680
Didn't you die once?!

363
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,300
Oh, he followed you all the way to Japan.

364
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,350
What a tough cockroach.

365
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,570
What is this?

366
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,170
I'm losing to a cockroach?

367
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,760
The cockroach is the one that's
being reunited by destiny?

368
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,560
He may have been watching
over you this entire time.

369
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,200
Stop that, Tae. It's not like that.

370
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,690
That's just ridiculous.

371
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,830
He couldn't have been protecting me.

372
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,750
Wait, what is this?

373
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,620
He would always show up dirty,

374
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,480
and I would hit him with my slipper.

375
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,940
Where is this going?

376
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,610
But he would always show up on
the nights when I felt lonely.

377
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,480
Those Christmas nights when I was sad.

378
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,780
He may have come to keep
me from being alone...

379
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,180
No, that can't be it!

380
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,240
Next thing I knew, I found myself always
staring at the cockroach's brilliance.

381
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,010
Listen up.

382
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,900
If there's one cockroach
around, there's thirty.

383
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,320
Why is a cockroach teaching class?!

384
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,950
And after school...

385
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,140
Bye, Mr. Cockroach!

386
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,450
Stay away from roach motels.

387
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,220
The hell is Mr. Cockroach
supposed to mean?!

388
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,880
I can't tell if that's a slander like Porky
Gorilla or a term of endearment!

389
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,880
[Note: Butagorilla (Porky Gorilla) is a character
from the manga "Kiteretsu Daihyakka"]

390
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,260
My chest hurts...

391
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,800
So tight...

392
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,210
I'm about to throw up...

393
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,100
Many people throw up after
seeing a cockroach!

394
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,690
This is...love!

395
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,020
The hell are you talking about?!

396
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,810
Student and cockroach...

397
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,920
I knew this love would never work.

398
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,990
But I wanted to tell him my feelings.

399
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,980
Tell the cockroach how I feel...

400
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,110
Say, everybody know what you're
doing for Christmas Eve?

401
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,380
Not really.

402
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,680
[Note: Japanese talk show that
airs at the end of year.]

403
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,070
Watch Santa Akashiya and go to sleep.

404
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,680
The Santas have lost interest!

405
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,900
A Santa watching Santa Akashiya?!

406
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,190
I'm spending Christmas
Eve with Otae-san.

407
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,630
What a coincidence. So am I.

408
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,990
Right? Gotta spend Christmas
with Otae-san.

409
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,980
What did you two reappear for, anyway?!

410
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,860
What about you, Kagura-chan?

411
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,870
Nothing really.

412
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,590
Why am I the only one
who got skipped over?!

413
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,650
Is that a present for someone?

414
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,880
Oh, making us jealous, huh?

415
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,370
Who's it for?

416
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:17,040
You've got it wrong! I was
going to wear it myself.

417
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,900
Oh, you should do that part like this.

418
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,130
You're amazing, Otae-chan!

419
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,790
You can knit.

420
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,190
I'm so bad at this...

421
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,230
I happen to be making something
myself right now.

422
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,590
What?! Otae-san is knitting something?!

423
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,490
Knitting what?! For who?!

424
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,780
There's something coming
out of her bag.

425
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,470
Ah!

426
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,400
You're wrong! This is, um...

427
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,450
That was when I saw something
I wasn't supposed to.

428
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,700
There were large initials
stitched on there...

429
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,750
"G."

430
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,440
[Note: "G" is the initial for
cockroach (gokiburi) in Japanese.]

431
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,990
Why?!

432
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,440
Why would Sis also fall for Roach Guy?!

433
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,370
Otae-chan, have you felt this
way since we were in Texas?

434
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,660
Tae-chan, who is this "G."?!

435
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,220
It stands for Gorilla, right?!

436
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,330
That'd be me, right?!

437
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,760
You trying to lay hands on my
Gin-san?! Ain't happening!

438
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,940
One of you couldn't be any more wrong!

439
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,220
Damn it!

440
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,440
I can't take any more of this crap!

441
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,480
Sorry, but I agree!

442
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,860
Christmas can go to hell!

443
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,040
The Santas just rejected Christmas!

444
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,130
Did I do something...wrong?

445
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,460
You didn't do anything wrong.

446
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,080
Nobody's wrong here.

447
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,430
What is this?!

448
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,280
And what role are you guys playing?!

449
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,060
You're Santas, right?

450
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,260
You're really Santas, right?!

451
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,330
I became scared...

452
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,580
I had a feeling that something would
change if I told G. how I felt...

453
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,770
If that were to destroy this
irreplaceable friendship...

454
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,940
Otae-chan, I...

455
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,580
On Christmas Eve...

456
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,260
they're cleaning the whole school.

457
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,360
There won't be a single
cockroach left alive.

458
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,360
So, since this is the end...

459
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,170
We both have to try our best.

460
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,120
Otae-chan...

461
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,960
No matter what happens,
I will always be...

462
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,610
...your friend.

463
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,970
Same here.

464
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,900
They're both stubborn fools.

465
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,660
It won't be the same after
you've fought over a man.

466
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,150
Humans only maintain relationships
that bring benefits.

467
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,910
The same goes for Santa.

468
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,320
If nobody believes in us,
we can't help them dream.

469
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,600
There is no real Santa in this world.

470
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,190
Done pretending to be Santa, huh?

471
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,990
Where are you two going?!

472
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,930
Sure, we're nothing like Santa.

473
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,080
But it's too early to say that
Santa doesn't exist.

474
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,000
We're off to see...

475
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,010
The real Santa and his
indiscriminate love.

476
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:14,100
After that, we spent sleepless nights knitting
away in preparation for Christmas Eve.

477
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,510
Because we're friends, I can't lose.

478
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,890
Because we're friends,
I have to do my best.

479
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,020
But the harder I tried, the more
the threads would fray.

480
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,370
We weren't making any progress.

481
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,950
And it was the morning
of Christmas Eve.

482
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,920
Oh no! I fell asleep!

483
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,000
What do I do? I'm only half-done...

484
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,010
There we found a finished knitting...

485
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,780
Half of it was roughly done
and unattractive,

486
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,690
but it looked very warm...

487
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,690
[Merry Christmas]

488
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,130
It's all clean now.

489
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,850
We'll feel clean as we
greet the new year!

490
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,470
Oh yeah. Where are Kagura-chan
and Otae-chan?

491
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,350
No idea. I think they're absent today.

492
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,950
[Year-3 Class-G]

493
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,380
Ew! A cockroach!

494
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,000
Why are you here?

495
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,680
What about the mittens?

496
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,560
And what about your
scarf, Kagura-chan?

497
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,500
I went back to sleep and when
I woke up, it was noon.

498
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,800
What a coincidence. Same here.

499
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,090
And I just realized that G. doesn't
have to mean Cockroach.

500
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,710
To my girlfriend.

501
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,320
That was impressive.

502
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,350
You didn't seek anything
in return for your efforts

503
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,550
while salvaging the friendship.

504
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,770
You win.

505
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,490
You're the real...

506
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,380
No.

507
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,010
We aren't Santas.

508
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,300
They're the real Santas.

509
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,610
The hell was that?!

510
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,530
How is this a contest for
deciding who's Santa?!

511
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,080
You're stealing all the glory!

512
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,170
[I'm Santa]

513
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,990
When we all love and
support one another,

516
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,920
everybody's a Santa.

517
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,960
Shut up!

518
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,240
You're all frickin' cockroaches!

519
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,160
No more of this!

520
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm leaving!

521
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,030
A complete waste of time.

522
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,190
Hey, wait up!

523
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,660
Hold on a sec!

524
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,210
Gin-chan.

525
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,490
Everybody.

526
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,030
And Pappy.

527
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,960
Happy Merry Last Episode.
