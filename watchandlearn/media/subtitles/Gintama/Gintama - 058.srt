00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,120
A moth flew in the darkness... The moth...

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,430
Did nothing but fly in complete darkness.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,530
Scared of the dark and searching for light, it flew on...

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,010
When the moth found a light, it flew around and around it...

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,370
But...

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:39,010
By that time, the moth could no longer pull itself away from the light even if it wanted to.

8
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,830
I wish you all the best of luck.

9
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,070
There's no need to worry, senpai.

10
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,550
If anything happens, I'll be the one to deal with it.

11
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,810
Let's go.

12
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,430
It's time to...begin our legend.

13
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,790
[Tetsuya Murata is this episode's client. He runs a swordsmith business with his younger sister, Tetsuko.]

14
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,660
[His father was, Jintetsu, Edo's best swordsmith. Benizakura, his infamous creation, has gone missing...]

15
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,940
Excuse me a moment.

16
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm looking for Kotaro Katsura-dono.

17
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,040
You've got the wrong guy.

18
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,620
No need to worry.

19
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,130
I'm not one of those Bakufu government dogs or anything.

20
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,960
You're a dog, but more like the bloodthirsty, rabid kind.

21
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,740
I've heard there's been a Tsujigiri roaming the streets lately.

22
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,250
[Note: A Tsujigiri is someone who kills innocent people randomly in order to test a new sword or skill.]

23
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,250
You should be careful who you try to bite.

24
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,430
Unfortunately, my partner and I thirst for the blood of strong men like you.

25
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,770
Will you fight me?

26
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,450
Shit! That sword...

27
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,500
Oh, my... Is that all you've got?

28
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,380
["Croquette Sandwiches Are Always the Most Popular Food Sold at the Stalls"]

29
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,080
Hey, what's all the hubbub?

30
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
It seems another corpse popped up.

31
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,550
Oh, that Tsujigiri again? How many people has he killed now?

32
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,780
I've heard that... He only goes after ronin.

33
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,140
It's so scary that I can't go out on the town at night.

34
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,870
Well, that just means... You'll have to stay home and take care of your wife.

35
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,300
Here's your tea.

36
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,900
Umm... What brings you here today?

37
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,970
What is this? Why has she come here? She's creepy.

38
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,560
She's been silent this whole time. Is she mad?

39
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,040
Is she mad about something? Did I do something bad to her?

40
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,800
Is she angry? She's smiling, isn't she?

41
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,080
Shinpachi, she doesn't like your tea.

42
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,700
Our guest is a coffee person, not a tea person, uh-huh.

43
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,210
You're a tea server. You should be able to figure out which one she is.

44
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:06,670
[NOTE: The "pachi" in "Shinpachi" means "eight" in Japanese. "Ichi" means "one" in Japanese.]

45
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,640
That's why you're Shinpachi, not Shinichi. What is a "pachi"?

46
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,670
There's no way I can tell that just by looking at her!

47
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,500
I noticed it right away. Take a look at our guest.

48
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,330
Her mouth looks like a coffee bean.

49
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,530
You don't have very good observational skills.

50
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,760
Here's your coffee.

51
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,740
Hey! What is that?!

52
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,850
Nothing's changed at all!!

53
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,590
You said her mouth looked like a coffee bean!!

54
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,140
I did not. I was talking about the side-view of a dorayaki.

55
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:32,960
[NOTE: Dorayaki is a Japanese sweet that consists of two pancake-like patties with sweet red bean paste in between.]

56
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,960
Really, could you cut it out already?

57
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,460
Why does it have to be so tense in my own home?

58
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,950
I feel like I'd get sucked in if I stared into those eyes.

59
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,850
Oh. Hello. This is the Odd Jobs.

60
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,940
Shinpachi, we've got to use our last resort. Let's use it.

61
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,260
Huh? But that's Gin-san's. He'll get mad.

62
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,920
It's all right. He's got to be weaned off of it by now.

63
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,540
He has no parents.

64
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,040
We need to raise him into...a proper adult.

65
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,840
Hey, I'm going out for a bit.

66
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,260
Oh! Hey, where are you going?!

67
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,180
Work. Take care of our guest.

68
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,840
Liar!! You're just trying to escape!!

69
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,100
Have some strawberry milk.

70
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,140
Elizabeth, samurai should eat plain and simple things.

71
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,150
If you consume strawberry milk, parfaits, and other soft and sweet foods,

72
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,010
then your body as well as your heart will become corrupt.

73
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,390
It cried!! We did it!! Does she like it that much?!

74
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,670
Good job. Well done, Shinpachi!

75
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,360
Huh? Did we really do it?

76
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,460
Umm... Excuse me. I'm from the Odd Jobs.

77
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,700
Umm... Excuse me. I'm from the Odd Jobs!

78
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,940
Excuse me. I'm the Odd Jobs guy!

79
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,830
Excuse me. I'm the Odd Jobs guy!

80
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,550
Huh?! What'd you say?!

81
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,120
I'm the Odd Jobs guy! We talked on the phone!!

82
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,140
I told you I don't need a newspaper!!

83
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,000
Stupid, stupid piece of crap! You can't hear me anyway.

84
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,030
I've done a terrible thing!!

85
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,360
I'm all sweaty from working, so my hand slipped. I'm sorry!

86
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,050
It's all right.

87
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,060
They definitely heard me.

88
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,820
I haven't told you yet...

89
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,670
We siblings are swordsmiths!

90
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm Tetsuya, the older brother!

91
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,340
And this is...

92
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,230
Hey, at least greet him, Tetsuko!

93
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,460
If you don't say your name, Sakata-san won't know what to call you, Tetsuko!!

94
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,580
Big Brother, you already told him my name. And loudly.

95
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,190
Sorry, Sakata-san, she's a shy beast!

96
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,200
Anyway, it must be pretty tough being a sword smith when swords have been outlawed.

97
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,520
Anyway, the job I want you to do is...

98
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,540
Hey, you're ignoring me? Maybe he didn't hear me...

99
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,960
Actually, someone stole Benizakura, the masterpiece

100
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,950
that the late head...in other words, my father, created!

101
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,180
Oh?! And what is Benizakura?

102
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,000
I want you to find it.

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,790
What?! He can't hear me again?!

104
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,120
Benizakura is a sword forged by my father, Jintetsu,

105
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,430
who was considered the greatest swordsmith in Edo.

106
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,420
It was said to be his greatest creation.

107
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:45,070
Its blade could split boulders and gleams pale crimson in the moonlight.

108
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,790
It's as mysterious and beautiful as cherry blossoms at night.

109
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,820
A truly splendid sword that has no equal.

110
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,460
Is that so?! That's amazing!

111
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,710
So do you have any idea who stole it?

112
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,490
But the Benizakura is a thing no human should ever touch.

113
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,150
Sir?! Listen to what other people have to say!!

114
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,190
Where are you looking? Are you looking at me?!

115
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,930
It all started when my father mysteriously died one month after forging the Benizakura.

116
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,330
Ever since then, misfortune has befallen

117
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,170
everyone who became involved with the Benizakura!

118
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,300
It's... It's a demon sword that consumes people's souls!

119
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:26,330
Come on. Give me a break. That means misfortune might fall on me too!!

120
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,550
Sakata-san.

121
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:33,120
Please find the Benizakura before it causes any more tragedy!

122
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,780
Listen to me!! He hasn't heard a single thing I've said!!

123
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,660
When you talk to my brother...

124
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,880
You've got to get close to his ear and speak from your diaphragm.

125
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,060
Huh? Really?!

126
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,320
Sir!! Excuse me!!

127
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,570
Shut up!!

128
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,590
So you're saying you found that here?

129
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,490
That bloody thing.

130
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,470
Furthermore, you haven't seen Katsura-san for several days?

131
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,380
Why didn't you tell us about this earlier, Elizabeth?

132
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,920
[A Tsujigiri has been roaming the streets lately... Do you suppose that...]

133
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,480
Elizabeth, you know better than anyone

134
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,030
that Katsura-san isn't the sort of person who would lose to some Tsujigiri.

135
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,270
But looking at this, it's obvious something happened to him.

136
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,270
If we don't find him quickly, something terrible might happen.

137
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,700
Katsura-san...

138
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,840
[It may already be too late...]

139
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,520
You idiot!!

140
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,010
[Gah!!]

141
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,390
If you don't believe in Katsura-san, then who will?!

142
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,420
When you were captured by that evil magistrate,

143
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,150
Katsura-san never gave up on you, no matter what!

144
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,040
Right now, what is it you must do, Elizabeth?!

145
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,200
What must you do for Katsura-san?!

146
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,330
Tell me!!

147
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,150
Say it! Say it!!

148
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,890
That hurts.

149
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,270
That hurts. Let go of me. Or I'll rip your guts out.

150
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,750
Sorry!!

151
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,230
Shinpachi, I'm going to look around with Sadaharu.

152
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,290
You look for the Tsujigiri with Lizzie!!

153
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,080
A demon sword? There's no way there'd be one in a recycle shop.

154
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,080
[Recycled Goods Shop
Earth Defense Army Base]

155
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,950
Well, nowadays you can buy demon swords by mail order.

156
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,080
