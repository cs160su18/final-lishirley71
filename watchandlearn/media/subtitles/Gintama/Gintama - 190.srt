00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,720
Happy New Year!

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,780
[Note: Scheduled for a 4/24 release date in Japan.]

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,780
With our movie coming up during
Golden Week this year...

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,380
We'll be working even harder!

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,920
So when you watch Gintama this year...

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,500
Make sure the room is well-lit and
don't sit too close to the TV!

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,000
What is this?

9
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,850
Have you ever seen cats mate?

10
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,650
When I was little, I innocently told Sis
to "carry me like the cats are doing"

11
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,930
which made for a traumatizing,
awkward moment.

12
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,630
Sounds more puma than trauma.

13
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,290
Nah, I'd say margay.

14
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,750
So did you know?

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,720
Male cats have a thorn
down there. A thorn.

16
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,480
Man, that's crazy stuff.

17
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,810
Seriously, if I'm reincarnated,
I'd better not be a cat.

18
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,130
Like you have any other use for it
besides peeing while standing.

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,780
Huh?

20
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,580
The cats are running away...

21
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,080
That's...

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,020
Ragged ears...

23
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,630
And its size...

24
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,950
Hoichi!

25
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,880
The boss cat of Kabukicho, Hoichi!

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,850
Our target has arrived!

27
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,620
Don't rush me...!

28
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,520
Look, you've made me
get it on my hands...

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,850
Pachi-boy, it's going for bait.

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,810
Damn misbehaving cat!

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,900
Ah! It got us!

32
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,430
Gin-san! Hurry after Hoichi!

33
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,220
Can you hear me?!

34
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,610
Gin-san!

35
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,020
Hey, get a hold of yourself.

36
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,040
A new face, huh?

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,960
Why are cats talking?

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,590
Am I dreaming?

39
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,410
I'm all dizzy.

40
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,870
If you don't feel well, get a drink of water.

41
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,800
I'll do that.

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,500
Hey, where's the water?

43
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,940
Right over there.

44
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,470
Huh?

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,420
Are you toying with me?

46
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,900
Drink that dirty water?

47
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,790
Don't assume I'm like you strays...

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,530
Huh?

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,160
What is this...?

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,660
Only trying to help.

51
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,790
Some attitude.

52
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,910
What's with him?

53
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,410
Why do I have to be such an ugly cat?!

54
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:53,420
["When Looking for Something,
Try Using its Perspective."]

55
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,920
That's odd. Where did Gin-san go?

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,200
He's probably off balling or ballsing.

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
You're still chasing that cat?

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,240
You can't even catch a cat?

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,090
That makes you less useful
than a plastic bottle.

60
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,310
What was that?!

61
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,380
Want me to tell you how useful plastic
bottles can be, you damn cat burglar?!

62
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,800
That's wrong! You're using it wrong!

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,610
Still, the cats in this town have
a tendency to misbehave.

64
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,720
They've been growing in numbers,
and I've heard about pets being injured,

65
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,010
parrots being eaten,
and fish being stolen.

66
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,990
So neighborhood association people are taking
steps to prevent any more strays...

67
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,730
Hand over your balls.

68
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,000
Neutering?

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,420
Yes.

70
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,700
They're catching strays in Kabukicho
and neutering them.

71
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,340
But the members aren't
able to handle Hoichi.

72
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,660
Sheesh, you were the ones who
left the cats to become strays.

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,100
The world would be better off if
we started neutering humans.

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,860
Could you hold off on the Human Memberality
Project until I've actually gotten to use mine?

75
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,030
But we can't ignore it.

76
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,860
The king of Kabukicho strays, Hoichi.

77
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,900
Violent and wily...

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
I've heard that it's bitten
large dogs to death

79
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,540
and injured children...

80
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,600
Did you see it happen?

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,910
No, but I'm sure of it after seeing
how he moved today.

82
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,910
You sure about that?

83
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,080
I don't think he's as bad as everyone
makes him out to be.

84
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,430
There it is!

85
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,260
Damn misbehaving cat!

86
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,310
Hand over your balls!

87
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,320
I-it's Hoichi!

88
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,130
Whatcha doing, kid?

89
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,010
You wanna lose your balls?

90
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,710
Wait up!

91
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,150
You're a vagabond?

92
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,470
Kid, I'll tell you the rules here.

93
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,820
There are no good cats here.

94
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,800
Ask for help and nobody will even budge.

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,320
But you saved me.

96
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,890
Every cat that's lost its
balls becomes soft.

97
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,440
It wouldn't be any fun
to fight a weakling!

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,550
Hoichi's beating up on another newbie.

99
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,190
If he doesn't put up a fight,
he'll be chased out of town.

100
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,280
I wonder if the vagabond
will be able to stay.

101
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,460
What kinda moves were those?

102
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,380
You wanna die?

103
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,460
Wait! I was just turned into a cat!

104
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,220
My synchronization ratio isn't
enough to control it, believe it!

105
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,500
A pussy like you can't
survive in this town!

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,440
Scram!

107
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,700
H-He's standing!

108
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,530
He's standing upright!

109
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,410
Teach me the rules of this town?

110
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,000
My history in this town...

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
And my history of eating left over food...

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,930
...dwarfs yours!

113
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,970
What's your name?

114
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,410
Gintoki Sakata...

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,270
Too long.

116
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,650
Gin will do.

117
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,230
Make sure you don't get your balls taken.

118
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,790
H-Hey!

119
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,510
Hold on...

120
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,230
Amazing! You're amazing!

121
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,370
That made Hoichi look bad!

122
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,910
Gin, you have a chance of defeating
Hoichi and taking over as boss!

123
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,160
We're sick of his oppression!

124
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,130
Why are you all celebrating?!

125
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,710
Stop it!

126
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,440
What are you doing?!

127
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,200
Don't sniff my ass!

128
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,420
Huh? What's that?

129
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,690
What? Arms crossed?

130
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,860
I'll get to the point.

131
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,200
You aren't a cat, are you?

132
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,150
I don't wanna hear that from someone
walking on two legs!

133
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,930
Did you do something here?

134
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,930
Huh?

135
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,000
What if I did?

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,640
The owner of this property is a kind
person who feeds the stray cats.

137
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,820
The cats gather here for that reason.

138
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:39,170
This grave was made by the kind owner
in memory of the strays who have died.

139
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,860
Hundreds of cat souls rest
beneath this ground.

140
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,070
I'll ask you again.

141
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,860
Did you do something?

142
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,500
I took a piss...

143
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,470
Hey! So I ended up like this
because of a cat curse?!

144
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,020
That's impossible!

145
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,460
The impossible has already
happened to us.

146
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,550
Us?

147
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,410
Don't tell me that you
also took a piss here.

148
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,400
Not a piss, a dump.

149
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,320
You're Zura?!

150
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,350
You took a dump out here?!

151
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,390
Could you consider the image
you're supposed to have?!

152
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,640
Seriously, man. You have no fear.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,040
A warrior must be prepared to do his
business in any place at any time.

154
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,650
Anyone who takes a dump on a grave
can't be considered a warrior!

155
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,090
I was drawn in by the sweet scent of paws,
but I didn't expect a trap...

156
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,840
You brought this on yourself!

157
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,510
But as a result, I was able to evade
the Shinsengumi's pursuit.

158
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,960
A fortunate turn of events,
or as they say, shit happens.

159
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,600
Hey! Someone shove a stick
of dynamite up his ass!

160
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,110
Why did this happen?!

161
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,310
I should have ignored Katsura!

162
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,860
If I look like this,
Otae-san and Toshi and Sogo

163
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,580
won't realize it's me!

164
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,390
Why a gorilla?!

165
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,220
Kondo, you were also cursed?

166
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,790
What?! You can recognize me?!

167
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,200
That voice...!

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,090
I'm so glad to have a buddy!

169
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,660
I don't care if you're Katsura!

170
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,210
I see!

171
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,040
You were also bitten by a weird gorilla...

172
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,020
No! You're the only one who was involved
in a Spider-Man-esque incident!

173
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,220
The owner's a kind person.

174
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,880
There's probably a stray gorilla around...

175
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,180
What the hell is a stray gorilla?!
I've never seen one before!

176
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,370
What do we do?

177
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,240
How do we return to normal?!

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,880
And I had to be stuck with
these useless idiots!

179
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,590
We were cursed for disturbing
the grave. If we restore it...

180
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,660
Restore it?

181
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,050
What, are you going to shove
your own dump back in there?!

182
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,160
For now, let's dig up the dump I buried.

183
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,910
Screw that!

184
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,890
It's your own dump!

185
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,490
You take responsibility!

186
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,710
If I return to normal, I won't
give you any help.

187
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,970
I feel sick...

188
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,400
Why are you adding more?!

189
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,350
Sh-Shoot!

190
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,800
My feline instincts...

191
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,890
I didn't expect my cat
synchronization ratio to rise meow.

192
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,530
Don't meow!

193
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,090
It appears that my transformation
into a cat is advancing meow.

194
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,740
Hey, stop it.

195
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,290
That meow really pisses
me off! It isn't cute!

196
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,740
You're a hopeless bunch.

197
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,410
I'll handle this.

198
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,010
Philippines bananas and
Taiwan bananas!

199
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,080
Which do you want?!

200
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,540
Make up your mind by the time I return!

201
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,030
It doesn't look like he's ever turning back.

202
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,650
There now.

203
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,800
Come here, kitties.

204
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
Eat your fill.

205
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,590
What's wrong?

206
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,180
Are you sleepy?

207
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,660
There, sleep tight.

208
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,260
We appreciate your cooperation.

209
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,270
They really take to you.

210
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,480
I feel sorry for them, but this
is for their own safety.

211
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,950
Please be gentle with them.

212
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,350
Don't worry.

213
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,070
We'll release them once
they're neutered.

214
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,420
So they successfully brought
the owner to their side...

215
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,340
Drugging our food...

216
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,390
Damn cowardly humans...

217
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,660
You're also a human.

218
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,620
I'll never trust humans again!

219
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,170
Humans around the world
are after our bananas!

220
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,940
I'll hunt their bananas first, then!

221
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,760
Nobody's after your dirty banana!

222
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,030
Man...

223
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,000
Why are they collecting cat balls?

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,020
Are they trying to summon
Shenlong or something?

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,330
[Note: The wish-granting dragon
from the manga Dragon Ball.]

226
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,330
I haven't had anything to eat for a day.

227
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,840
My tail is starting to look
like a frankfurter.

228
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,130
We'll have to forget about returning to normal
for now and focus on securing food meow.

229
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,280
Hey, I told you to stop meowing.

230
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,270
How are we supposed
to secure food baboo?

231
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,070
Hey, cut that out already.

232
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,550
Hunt down some mice

233
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,520
or beg humans for food meow.

234
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,370
Th-That's not funny baboo!

235
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,500
How could a samurai behave like that?!

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,110
I'd rather die than be domesticated baboo!

237
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,170
Then die.

238
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,840
Ho-Hoichi!

239
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,250
Your pride won't do you any good when
you're trying to make it in this place.

240
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,110
The only pride you need here
is the pride to survive.

241
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,610
If you have the guts to live, follow me.

242
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,780
Hey, where are you going?

243
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,530
Is it safe to wander around here?

244
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,970
Does he intend to teach us how to hunt?

245
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,200
Why would he do that?

246
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,020
He's a violent bastard that attacked
me the second I turned into a cat.

247
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,770
I received the same treatment,
but something about it bothered me.

248
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,130
I don't believe he was entirely serious.

249
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,180
Fact is, every newbie has been attacked,

250
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,120
but none have been seriously injured.

251
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,390
He stops once you've shown you're
brave enough to stand firm...

252
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,690
Ooh! It's a parade of cats!

253
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,550
Oh? Why if it isn't Hoichi?

254
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,740
What? Are you going somewhere
with your friends?

255
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,260
Oryo, you know him?

256
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,830
It's a stray that often
comes here for food.

257
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,010
Wh-What the hell?!

258
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,480
They love him?!

259
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,570
When he's old?!

260
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,070
When he's so ugly?!

261
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,560
Listen up, fellas.

262
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,100
You have to be selective
when begging for food.

263
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,880
Young girls make great targets.

264
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,240
They gush over anything cute,

265
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,840
and they think of themselves as cute
when they fawn over animals.

266
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,230
Lonely-looking young men will also work.

267
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,100
As well as curious, snot-nosed kids.

268
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,590
Once you find a target, suck up.

269
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,560
Act cute.

270
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,970
Got it?

271
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,810
It's all in how you act.

272
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,360
Aim for the ugly-cute.

273
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,340
Ugly cute?!

274
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,360
Such a mythical style actually
exists in the animal world?!

275
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,670
I'll do it! I'll give it a shot!

276
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,910
This may be where I truly belong!

277
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,460
Well?

278
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,630
Ugly-cute? Gross-cute?

279
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,620
Ugly-gross.

280
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,880
You have no chance.

281
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,740
Your ugly factor is too strong.

282
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,140
Any half-assed measures
will only make it worse.

283
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,000
Only piss people off.

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,860
What was that?!

285
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,170
Don't mess with gorillas!

286
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,620
Do you know the gorilla's
scientific name?!

287
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,090
It's "Gorilla gorilla gorilla"!

288
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,680
It's gorilla all the way!

289
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,440
A reincarnation ring of gorilla!

290
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,470
Please help me!

291
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,620
Calm down, Gorilla gorilla gorilla.

292
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,530
We'll be shot down if we act individually.

293
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,320
Have you heard of the
show "Shimura Zoo"?

294
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,180
The one with a chimpanzee
walking a dog around.

295
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,940
We'll go with the gorilla-cat version.

296
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,110
Operation Gorilla Shimura Guerrilla.

297
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,240
I see!

298
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,370
[Note: Veteran Japanese Comedian,
also the host of "Shimura Zoo".]

299
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,370
Then call Ken Shimura here at once!

300
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,280
Got it! I'm off to Higashimurayama!

301
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,990
[Note: Ken Shimura once covered a song
based on the city of Higashimurayama.]

302
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,990
Hey! This has nothing to
do with that Shimura!

303
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,260
The audience will be moved when they see
Shimura, Emperor of the Skit, laugh and cry!

304
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,310
That would be Operation Shimura
Lachryma Ooh-La-La!

305
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,440
Hey, here comes the next sucker.

306
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,030
What?

307
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,250
That's right.

308
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,850
And Gin-san hasn't returned yet.

309
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,190
Knowing him, he's probably
off somewhere hammered.

310
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,500
There's no need to worry.

311
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,120
A-A different Shimura showed up!

312
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,380
This is bad.

313
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,820
Hey, Gorilla Shimura Godzilla is here.

314
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,950
Let's pull back!

315
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,010
No! Otae-san might be
able to recognize us!

316
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,030
Hey, stupid!

317
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,730
The leash from Operation
Shimura is still...!

318
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,600
Otae-san! It's me! Me!

319
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,010
Kondo!

320
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,610
My, what is that?

321
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,880
Cats are walking a gorilla!

322
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,490
Stupid-cute!

323
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,040
Usually, gorillas are smarter than cats.

324
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,190
A gorilla would walk a cat.

325
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,080
But this gorilla is amazing!

326
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,280
Amazingly stupid!

327
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,870
Stupid-cute!

328
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,510
St-Stupid-cute?

329
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,890
What is this?

330
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,420
How stupid is he?

331
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,940
Did he run away from a mental zoo?

332
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,010
There, there.

333
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,380
Otae-san...

334
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,770
That Otae-san...

335
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,380
...is petting my head!

336
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,860
I'm so glad I was born a gorilla!

337
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,790
Uh, you aren't a gorilla.

338
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,720
There isn't time to celebrate.

339
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,800
Beg for food.

340
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,010
Who needs food?!

341
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,110
This memory will last me a lifetime!

342
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,970
Shut up!

343
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,690
Just get us food!

344
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,200
Kyu-chan, it looks like they're hungry.

345
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,420
Do you have anything?

346
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,040
Unfortunately, right now...

347
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,780
I only have a boneless ham on me.

348
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,360
That'll do! We don't need anything else!

349
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,740
Give! Give to us!

350
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,060
And why is she walking around
with a huge chunk of meat?!

351
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,940
Is she headed for Castlevania?!

352
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,740
I see, you only have a boneless ham.

353
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,250
Guess we can't do anything then.

354
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,050
Sorry, I only have a boneless
ham on me.

355
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,930
I'll bring something better next time.

356
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,270
Huh?!

357
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,540
Hey, wait!

358
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,910
I said that it'll do!

359
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,440
Where are you going to use
that ham if not here?!

360
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,170
Kyu-chan, we should get going.

361
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,690
Sorry about bothering you to fix my TV.

362
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,570
It's nothing.

363
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,450
I just have to give it a good smack
with this boneless ham.

364
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,700
Do you really have to use
a boneless ham for that?!

365
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,740
Sorry.

366
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,220
A boneless ham has too much
salt so it wouldn't be healthy.

367
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,720
It's okay! Don't worry about that!

368
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,170
Instead, here's something I made.

369
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,800
This looks 100 times more unhealthy!

370
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,990
Goddamn it!

371
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,240
The woman dangled a ham before us
before leaving us with this dark matter!

372
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,000
Left us with this huge piece of shit!

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,370
Operation Shimura with the shitmura.

374
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,610
Hey, bring the leash!

375
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,270
We'll turn this guy into ham!

376
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,160
There! Take that!

377
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,330
Wait, look over there!

378
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,950
S-Sorry...

379
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,950
Keep this a secret from Otae-chan.

380
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,270
K-Kyubei-kun...

381
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,620
Did you change your mind
and bring the ham...?

382
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,020
She took the dark matter with her!

383
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,580
She's eating it?!

384
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,440
She's gonna eat it?!

385
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,690
She really loves Otae, huh?!

386
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,200
Unbelievable...

387
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,030
All this effort and we still
can't secure food...

388
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,010
This is the world of stray
cats in Kabukicho...?

389
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,050
Don't start sobbing after failing one hunt.

390
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,650
Tail up and stare straight ahead.

391
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,740
Look.

392
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,370
Isn't that Sogo?!

393
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,210
Is he looking for me?

394
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,870
Sorry about making you worry!

395
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,430
Ah, he looked over here.

396
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,500
He keeps glancing over here.

397
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,180
He blushed?

398
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,170
Huh? What?

399
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,130
He likes cats?

400
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,230
Does he like cats?

401
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,840
No, he likes gorillas.

402
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
The sight of a gorilla must have
reminded him of how I'm missing.

403
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,880
Ah. Isn't that a sausage?

404
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,150
Shinsengumi sausage!

405
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,260
My favorite Shinsengumi sausage!

406
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,440
No, that isn't your sausage!

407
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,810
It's my favorite Shinsengumi sausage!

408
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,380
Bastard! How can you say that when
you're in the Anti-Foreigner Faction?!

409
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,060
That sausage is only for
Shinsengumi members!

410
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,940
Fool! You are no longer a member
of the Shinsengumi!

411
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,730
You're just a Gorilla gorilla gorilla!

412
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,910
Don't use the scientific name!

413
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,560
Want me to kill you?!

414
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,030
Bastard! Why are you
begging by yourself?!

415
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,320
I'm the one who gets to beg!

416
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,350
Hey! Are you really in the
Anti-Foreigner Faction?!

417
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,020
Shut up!

418
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,090
I am now Katsura katsura katsura!

419
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,950
No, you're Katsura!

420
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,810
Let me go!

421
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,100
The sausage is mine!

422
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,120
No, it's mine!

423
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,360
Huh? What are you doing?

424
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,380
Hey, would you also consider the thing
hanging from his crotch a sausage?

425
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,860
What are you talking about?

426
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,850
That's clearly a sausage!

427
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,840
Damn kid!

428
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,230
I'll neuter you!

429
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,980
Wait! There's another target over there!

430
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,720
Th-That's!

431
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,990
I-Isn't that Toshi?!

432
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,170
He keeps glancing over here.

433
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,660
What? It's creeping me out.

434
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,690
He pulled something out.

435
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,220
Kondo-san, Kondo-san.

436
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,240
Can I ask you something?

437
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,100
What?

438
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,360
What's he doing?

439
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,500
What is that?

440
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,290
Huh?

441
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,220
Does he want to be killed?

442
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,850
Huh? I don't want that crap!

443
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,290
Do you want us to kill you?!

444
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,320
Why are you showing
it off?! Pisses me off!

445
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,440
He thinks we want some?! Pisses me off!

446
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,490
Toshi! Please stop!

447
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,120
It's embarrassing!

448
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,730
Embarrassing for me, too!

449
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,520
I can't take this anymore!

450
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,610
Ah! Wait!

451
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,580
Huh? What are you doing?

452
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,650
What the hell are you doing?!

453
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,070
I'll kill you! I'll definitely kill you!

454
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,150
Forgive him!

455
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,350
He's not used to this!

456
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,960
He's not used to this kind of thing!

457
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,070
He thinks that everyone in the
world loves mayonnaise!

458
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,100
Calm down and move
on to the next target!

459

Okay? Let's move on!

460
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,260
Hey.

461
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,050
Just kidding.

462
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,020
Keep it a secret.

463
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,990
Let's hunt him.

464
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,120
Nothing to show for a whole day of work.

So much for that. I'll show you
