To celebrate the Gintama anime becoming a movie
and breaking roughly one million in DVD sales,

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,730
we held the second character
popularity poll.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,740
However, a bloody ranking battle has waged
by those unsatisfied with the results.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,540
Who will be in 1st place
at the end of this battle?!

I look away for a second
and this happens.

8
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,810
There's a traitor among us.

9
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,380
Well then...

10
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,150
Who might it be, Shinpachi-kun?

11
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,390
I-It wasn't us!

12
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,940
Hasegawa-san was ranked
lower than us!

13
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,840
So why would we need
to lower his rank?!

14
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,540
That assumption may be a mistake.

15
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,740
If the perpetrator's goal
isn't to raise his rank,

16
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,320
but to take out people he doesn't like...

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,370
That's...

18

That's just...!

been a lower rank than you,

of the glasses being the main body.

that Zaki's character

down will lower your rank,

then you shouldn't wear underwear
to begin with!

his dirty parts to a girl?!

why before you all go to hell.

along with the ranking

only works on you losers!

on a regular basis

and exposed my private
parts many times!

of seeing me fully expozed!

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,120
I should be the only eggheaded character!

163
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,430
Change your character to the one-eyed
dragon this very instant!

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,320
The leader of the Yagyu who randomly speaks
English, rides a horse like a Harley,

166
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,080
and goes, "Let's party!"

167
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,970
I refuse.

You and your long hair should jump off a
waterfall to learn the Rozan Sho Ryu Ha.

170
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,750
So you refuse to listen, head-chief...?

171
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,180
In that case...

172
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,680
Let's party!

173
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,480
Hijikata-han, don't you need
to go "let's party"?

174
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,990
Aren't you the one who really
wants to "let's party"?

175

Aren't you all excited about the
second season coming up?

What are you trying to imply?!

178
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,560
Stop saying crap that'll bring
down the fourth wall!

179
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,250
As long as you're around,

180
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,410
the Shinsengumi, including Kondo-san,
won't be able to stand alone at the top.

181
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,100
As long as you're around,

182
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,920
Kondo-san's image as a perverted
stalker won't go away.

183
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,490
It all ends now.

184
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,780
This stupid mess and everything bad
in the Shinsengumi's history...

185
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,140
So you intend to eliminate the woman who is the
source of your boss's scandalous behavior?

186
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,010
I would expect no less from the
demon vice-commander.

187
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,340
You're used to doing dirty work.

188
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,860
However...

189
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,190
There's no point in worrying about
the Shinsengumi at this point.

190
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,370
Since your Shinsengumi
and everything else

191
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,660
will be absorbed by us!

192

Toshi!

193
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,730
Come to our side!

194
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,790
It appears that it's only a matter
of time before 3rd falls.

195
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,960
You've made a fatal mistake in
your push to reach the top.

196
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,370
What's that?

197
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,630
Don't be a poor loser.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,070
See?

199
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,330
Our rank has changed.

200
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,270
3rd is now one of us.

201
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,590
What?!

202
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,540
This is...!

203
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,920
12th?!

204
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,060
Impossible!

205
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,470
Why did our rank suddenly drop?!

206
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:47,660
It was a brilliant plan to absorb
the higher ranked members.

207
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,410
But our commander isn't the
type you can hold down.

208
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,530
C-Could it be...?!

209
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,500
Him?!

210
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,830
He's so offensive that he's starting to drag
Diamond Perfume's ranking down!

211
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,300
Curses!

212
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,970
It was a terrible mistake
to absorb that gorilla!

213
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,400
Toshi!

214
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,210
Now!

215
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,780
Do me!

216
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,840
Embarrass me!

217
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,110
If my rank goes down,

218
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,820
so will theirs!

219
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,770
Kondo-san...

220
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,170
Don't tell me, you...!

221
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,860
You purposefully allowed yourself to be absorbed
so you could destroy them from the inside?!

222
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,680
Don't worry about me!

223
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,530
Defeat me along with them!

224
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,150
That's impossible, Kondo-san!

225
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,450
I can't do it!

226
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,100
Do it!

227
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,250
Do it, damn it!

228
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,700
You said the Shinsengumi will
dominate the top, didn't you?!

229
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,010
I'll catch up to you afterwards!

230
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,160
That's impossible!

231
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,370
I'm supposed to embarrass you more when
you're standing there fully expozed?!

232
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,610
I can't do it!

233
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,720
And hell, what would be more embarrassing
than being fully expozed?!

234
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,710
Stop wasting time!

235
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,430
Do you intend to waste Kondo-san's
good intentions!

236
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,560
Take this!

237

A waist pouch on a naked body!

238
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,700
That's it!

239
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,960
Keep it up!

240
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,350
I won't let that happen!

241
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,970
A waist pouch goes with chemical-washed jeans!

242
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,900
What?!

perfectly coordinating to the waist pouch!

I'm not giving in!

accept it, but I won't!

1st place in such a manner?!

her hands dirty? Who stays clean this time?

Yes, yes. You're so cool.

Amazing, right?

286

You're probably so calm

really pisses me off!

Wh-What is this?!

322
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,360
My ranking...

323
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,620
My ranking is dropping like a rock!

324
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,950
What's going on?!

325
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,770
I didn't do anything!

326
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,490
What's happening?!

327
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,530
W-We're too late...

328
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,090
Hasegawa-san!

329
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,120
We spent too much time fighting...

330
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,920
We let our greed get the better of us,
wanting to rank higher than others.

331
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,060
We displayed our ugly conflict
for the past three weeks.

332
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,890
The viewers, the gods punished
us for our sins.

333
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,310
Y-You must stop this fight now!

334
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,940
D-Don't let him have his way!

335
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,210
Him?

336
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,860
He was the one who used unnatural
methods to summon the gods!

337
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:50,310
He was the one who took me down
and set your fight in motion.

338
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:56,900
No, he was the one who caused the
mess across this entire world.

339
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,560
Return to the beginning...

340
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,780
Why was there such an uproar?

341
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,840
What started all of this?

342
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,200
Head to the roof...

343
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,500
To end this stupid mess!

344
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,730
You're late.

345
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,620
I've been waiting here
to show you this sight.

346
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,010
Look.

347
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,070
They're all desperately fighting
for their own rank.

348
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,300
Isn't that funny?

349
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,190
Their attempts to raise their ranking do
nothing but make them look worse.

350
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,410
All humans are the same on the inside.

351
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,340
Nobody is suitable to be 1st.

352
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,940
We're all dirty maggots.

353
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,250
Yamazaki-san...

354
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,840
So this was all your doing...

355
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,530
You pretended that you were attacked

356
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,780
to drag your own rank down and
cause an uproar in the rankings,

357
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,250
to spark everybody's greed
and create a mess

358
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,330
that triggered the rage of the gods...

359
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
You couldn't become 1st.

360
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,300
You didn't try to become 1st.

361
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,340
Instead, you brought everyone
else down to your level.

362
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,910
Yamazaki-san...

363
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,550
Are you satisfied now?

364
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,490
Flowers need a foundation of dirt.

365
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,870
But the flowers never try to understand
how the dirt feels...

366
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,400
They bloom without a care...

367
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,510
Despite the fact that they could
never bloom without dirt...

368
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,990
I wanted to let them know
how the dirt feels...

369
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,040
Our true worth...

370
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,500
Punch me if you want.

371
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,200
But your ranking will only drop further.

372
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,460
The gods have grown tired
of this ugly battle!

373
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,530
Invite their rage if you'd like!

374
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,700
That's fine!

375
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,820
I'll smack you good!

376
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,210
Toying with people like that!

377
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,720
Don't look down on us!

378
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,520
Shi-

379
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,980
Gin-san, I won't let you dirty your hands.

380
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,550
I'm...

381
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,850
Happy to be the dirt for my flower!

382
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,000
Yamazaki-san, it's true that people
like us are never noticed.

383
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,250
Nobody tries to understand how we feel.

384
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,870
But that's fine.

385
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,340
We just have to be there like it's the
most natural thing in the world.

386
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,920
That's what dirt does.

387
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,390
Yamazaki-san, that was the spirit of being the
stepping stone that you taught me about!

388
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,950
And are you really okay with that?

389
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,020
Spending the rest of your life downtrodden
without anyone noticing...

390
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,550
Don't say that nobody notices us...

391
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,270
I... I alone know!

392
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,870
Yamazaki-san alone knows!

393
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,910
Isn't that enough?!

394
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,640
What more do you need?!

395
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,540
Sh-Shinpachi-kun...

396
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,980
You aren't the only ones.

397
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,730
E-Everyone...

398
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,430
Up. Look up.

399
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,740
It seems that the gods
were also watching.

400
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,410
This is...

401
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,190

Hooray! Hooray!

404

We'll be your stepping stones for today!

405
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,100
Hooray! Hooray!

406
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,460
Zaki!

407
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,470
Thanks for supporting us
when we didn't know it!

408
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,000
Come on, you two!

409

Dirt should return to the dirt.

Why are you two in 1st?

416
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,350
You had us fooled, damn punks.

417
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,110
Allow us to ask one more time...

418
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,990
Are popularity polls...
