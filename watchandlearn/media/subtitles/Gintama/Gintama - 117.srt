00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,380
Let's defeat Otohime.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,580
Now that everyone on this
planet has become old,

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,060
we're the only ones who can do it.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,880
But since you're not, I can toss
you aside. I'm much cuter.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,160
Huh?! Bring it on! Show your face!

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,170
Huh?! You want to fight?!
You think you can beat me?!

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,740
Otohime gave up her quest for
eternal youth and beauty.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,400
And decided to use the box as revenge

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,070
against those who had what
she no longer did.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,780
In other words,

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,860
she planned to turn all the people
of Earth into old geezers.

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,980
You're just a young brat, that's all!

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,570
If I was younger... If only
I was younger...

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,210
Your age isn't your only problem, tramp!

16

[Gintoki and the others split into three
teams... And head for the palace!!]

[Shinpachi's fighting power is 362 K. What's a K unit?!]

["Beauty is Like A Summer Fruit"]

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes... Otohime won't let anyone
be more beautiful than her.

20
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,950
In order to insure that she's the most
beautiful woman in the world...

21
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,860
she plans to turn this world
into a planet of the elderly.

22
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,230
No way... That's such a selfish reason.

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
She thinks she has the
right to throw our world

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,100
into chaos for a crappy reason like that?!

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,760
She thinks people will let her take
away their summer vacations?!

26
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,930
History is always moved
at the whim of its rulers.

27
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,630
She's 3,000 years old. She's lived
a very long time...too long.

28
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,320
During all that time, she's lost
so many important things.

29
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,170
The only way to stop her is
to put an end to her life.

30
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,030
Isn't there any way to
turn everyone back?

31
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,270
What about Sis?

32
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,630
All our answers are probably...

33
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,820
in there...

34
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,260
with Otohime...

35
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,390
All right, let's split up into three teams.

36
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,600
If we stay together and are discovered,
we'll all be caught.

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
If just one of us is caught, the rest
of us can still get to Otohime.

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,640
Even if in the end there's
only one of us left.

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,190
But can we split up into three groups

40
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,400
and still take out Ryugu
Palace's security?

41
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,320
It'll be tough with our numbers.

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,920
We can a least confuse and
distract them by splitting up.

43
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,800
Let's see if we can divide
up our power evenly.

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,240
What is that? I think I saw that in
a another manga somewhere.

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,420
It's a spouzer. It basically
measures fighting ability.

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,420
[Note: Parody of scouter from Dragon Ball.]

47
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,780
No, that's a scouter, isn't it?

48
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,580
It looks just like a scouter,
don't you think?

49
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,450
No, It's a spouzer. I won it in
a festival night stall raffle.

50
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,840
It's just a copy!!

51
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,440
I'll use this to measure
your fighting power

52
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,290
and split everyone into three
equal teams. First...

53
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,700
You.

54
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,840
362 K.

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,070
Oh? That's pretty impressive
for your age.

56
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,490
What is a K?

57
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,540
I don't know what you're basing
that on. Is that impressive?

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,740
It means you have the fighting
power of 362 leaves of kelp.

59
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,560
[K=Kelp]

60
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,250
Why kelp?! A single leaf of kelp
doesn't have any fighting power!

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,710
Taking into consideration that a
normal person is about 360 K,

62
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,720
you're two leaves of kelp better
than the average person.

63
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,180
Just two leaves?!

64
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,000
What exactly was my ten years
of sword training for?!

65
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,040
Hey, Kamenashi, can I have
these sunglasses?

66
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,580
I can't relax if I'm not
wearing sunglasses.

67
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,390
Your fighting power is 654 K.

68
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,370
Why?! Why is Hasegawa-san
higher than me?!

69
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,910
You shouldn't judge others
by how they look.

70
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,650
Without his sunglasses, he's only 1 K.

71
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,880
What?!

72
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,700
Oh, Madao is really nothing more
than just a pair of sunglasses.

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,830
It's like his essence.

74
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,110
That's weird!! 1K? That
means I'm not human!!

75
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,550
I'm just a single leaf of kelp!!

76
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,510
You're next...

77
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,160
Amazing. 7930 O.

78
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,390
What's O mean? That's a different unit.

79
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,500
The units change when I scan
girls. It becomes cuter.

80
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,700
Oh, does it stand for 7,930 flowers?

81
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,290
[Note: "Boobs" in Japanese is "oppai."]

82
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,290
7,930 boobs.

83
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,410
That's not cute at all!! That's perverted!!

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,320
Are you trying to make fun of a
warrior?! I don't need boobs.

85
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,900
Change it to 7,930 penises!!

86
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,790
Stop!! That's even more disgusting!!

87
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,750
Hey, how many boobs am I?

88
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,110
No... Wait a second.

89
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,580
8,000... 8,500... I can't believe
it. It went up again... No, it's...

90
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,580
It's dropping?! It's not 8,500 O!

91
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,690
It's minus 8,500 O!! Unbelievable.
What's the meaning of this?!

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,850
What's this?! It's those two behind her?!

93
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,010
Those two geezers equal a fighting
power of... -15,000 ... NO, -30,000.

94
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,250
I-It's still going down!

95
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,880
It's simply immeasurable.

96
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,000
-30,000? How much of
a burden are they?!

97
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,740
All of us together can't overcome that!!

98
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,170
-30,000... Even the whole staff of a
retirement home can't handle that.

99
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,370
If I place one of them in each
team, they're still -15,000.

100
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,700
That's a big gap.

101
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,340
Oh well. In order to raise their
numbers as much as possible,

102
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,310
I'll have each of them carry
100 leaves of kelp.

103
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,660
It's a mere consolation, but
it's better than nothing.

104
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,840
No, nothing is better!!

105
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,020
Why does their power level increase
when they're carrying kelp?!

106
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,740
I'll hold 300 leaves! I'll
cover Gin-chan's gap!!

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
That's...

108
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,130
Oh no!! They found us!!

109
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,800
They're going to fire.

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Everyone, scatter!!

111
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,520
We'll attack from this side!!

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,580
Shinpachi and everyone
else take a different route!!

113
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,710
Hey, wait!!

114
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,680
Weren't you going to split our fighting
power into three even groups?!

115
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
What was the point of the spouzer?!

116
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,370
There's only trash here!!

117
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,820
At least take one of the old men!

118
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,830
Hey, don't ignore me! I know
you can hear me, can't you?!

119
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,240
They're coming after us!!

120
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,610
Shinpachi-kun, leave this to us and run!!

121
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,370
Run?! I'm stuck with these
old geezers?! Why me?!

122
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,710
I'll leave the future of Ryugu Palace...

123
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,610
the future of the world
to you young fellas.

124
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,950
They're not young!!

125
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,770
You're going to fight with me, huh?

126
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,950
Sorry for sticking you with
such a terrible job.

127
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,430
I'm the one with the terrible job!!

128
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,630
It doesn't matter. I discarded
my life once before.

129
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,460
Old soldiers like us should just pass on.

130
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,560
The old soldiers are right over here!!

131
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,580
Let's go!!

132
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,770
We're taking all of you...

133
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,940
with us to hell!!

134
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,370
You guys were completely useless!

135
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,070
Are you putting all your
hope in those fools?

136
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,470
They are this planet's last hope?

137
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,510
I have nothing to worry about then.

138
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,140
They'll meet your fate soon.

139
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,360
Why don't you go meet
them in the next world?

140
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,310
This is your punishment
for incurring my wrath.

141
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,000
If you want to kill me, then go ahead.

142
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,340
You kill people you don't like,

143
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,590
you turn people who are more beautiful
than you into senior citizens.

144
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,700
You won't ever gain eternal
beauty that way.

145
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,770
Even if you did gain eternal youth.

146
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,510
No matter how beautiful
a kimono you wear...

147
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,260
I know without a doubt...

148
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,060
that you will always be ugly.

149
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,300
Your heart and soul
are ugly and rotten.

150
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,480
Watch your mouth, little girl!
What do you know?!

151
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,220
You're young and beautiful!
What could you possibly know?!

152
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,530
What do you know about the feelings
of a woman who's been left to live

153
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,400
and grow old by herself
for thousands of years?

154
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,940
What do you know about my feelings?

155
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,060
About getting uglier and decaying
all alone but never dying!

156
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,250
You're not the only one who ages.

157
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,790
Everyone, no matter how beautiful,

158
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,140
grows wrinkled and dies in the end.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,130
But even if their looks change,

160
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,300
there's always some things
that never change.

161
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,790
Even if our bodies are destroyed.
No matter how many years pass...

162
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,320
We believe there's something
that can never be destroyed.

163
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,910
But even if we become wrinkled,
we still won't lose to you.

164
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,750
That's because we know
what true beauty is.

165
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,860
Something that is truly beautiful
cannot be destroyed, you say?

166
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,760
How interesting.

167
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,530
In that case...

168
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,650
Show me...

169
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,270
That beauty you speak of!!

170
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,520
It's you or me... The winner is
the one who's truly beautiful!!

171
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,810
Where did they go?!

172
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,840
Find them! They should be nearby!

173
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,780
We managed to escape.

174
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,870
Please, Gin-san, Katsura-san, run
away on your own two feet.

175
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,140
I don't care what happens
to you geezers anymore.

176
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,310
Honestly. Young people these days...

177
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,340
Complaining about something
like this? How pathetic.

178
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,900
[Note: Parody of Dragon Ball.]

179
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,900
When we were young, we
had to carry Master Roshi,

180
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,420
who had a turtle shell on his
back, and deliver the milk...

181
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,210
Who's Master Roshi?!

182
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,400
Don't revise your memory to include
parts from a mega-hit manga!

183
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,310
Hey, Zura ...

184
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,770
What was I going to say?

185
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,800
You're taking too long to comment,
and you even forgot what you were saying!

186
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,690
Oh yeah...In the end, you played
with the Mega Drive, too.

187
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,330
That was your comment
from the last episode!!

188
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,100
Why are you commenting on something
that happened an episode ago?!

189
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,280
No one will remember that!!

190
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,060
As I expected of you, Gintoki.

191
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,680
That's one of those surrealism comments
that's so popular lately.

192
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,290
A fine surreal comment.
Young people just don't get it.

193
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,830
Zura, who is Master Roshi?

194
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,520
Don't go revising your memory to include
parts from a mega-hit manga.

195
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,410
Old fart!!

196
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,710
If you don't cut it out, I'll dump you
off in the mountains, damn it!!

197
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,210
Crap. If we fight against Otohime
like this, we're going to lose.

198
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,850
What should I do?

199
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,030
What's this?

200
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,700
That's long enough. Pull her up.

201
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,430
What a foolish woman.

202
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,890
Does she think she can get
away with defying me?

203
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,060
I'm sure she's become
quite beautiful now...

204
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,100
A beautiful bloody corpse.

205
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,660
I-Impossible! What?!

206
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,900
Y...

207
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,690
You fools! How did you get in here?!

208
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,180
Th-The water!!

209
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,310
I-Impossible!! You broke in by smashing
the ceiling of the lower floor?!

210
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,040
Get them, my guards!!

211
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,590
Fire!!

212
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,330
Tsk. She's so fast that
we can't get near her!!

213
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,860
Yahoo!

214
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,420
Tsk! She's on top of the shark!!

215
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,650
Shoot her and the shark down!!

216
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,160
What are you fools doing?

217
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,250
They're all rebels!! Hurry
up and get rid of them!!

218
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,060
Yes!!

219
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
I told you.

220
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,730
We won't lose no matter
what happens to us.

221
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,150
I-I won't accept that!!

222
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,720
I'm the most beautiful
woman in the world!!

223
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,470
I'm going to win this battle!!

224
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,670
I won't allow anyone to be...

225
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,100
more beautiful that I am!!

226
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,640
You're just a little girl who only has youth!!

227
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,890
That face!!

228
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,330
I'll make it ugly and swollen!!

229
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,480
She's beautiful?! I-Impossible!

230
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,600
Why is she so beautiful
when I'm hitting her?

231
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,160
It's like the ethereal beauty
of a falling flower!!

232
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,070
You think your weak slaps
can make me ugly?

233
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,220
Now it's my turn!!

234
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,010
What?! A punch?!

235
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,960
Who punches a woman's face?!

236
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,800
Furthermore, she's hitting places
that'll definitely make me ugly.

237
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,470
What a formidable woman!!

238
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,370
And she's made all the flowers behind
me scatter so gracefully.

239
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,640
I can't keep up with this.

240
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,450
I need to use my trump card!!

241
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,430
Take this!! Nose hooks!!

242
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,950
No one can escape such
a devilish attack.

243
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,460
No matter how beautiful you are,
you'll become the ugly one...

244
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,890
What?! She looks like Naoko?!

245
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,890
[Note: Naoko Ken is a Japanese
actress and singer.]

246
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,690
Compared to her, whose nose
is even more upturned...

247
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,860
this girl doesn't look ugly at all even when
I've got her stuck in such a position!

248
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,860
Now it's my turn!!

249
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,460
I won't let you!!

250
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,550
In that case, I'll use...

251
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,410
Shinji!!

252
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,410
[Shinji Tanimura is a Japanese singer.]

253
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,420
Shinji?! Impossible!! She punched him out first?!

254
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,630
You lose, Otohime!
Give up and let go of me!

255
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,950
Turn everyone... Turn the whole
world back to normal!!

256
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,850
You already know that...

257
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,310
doing this won't change anything!!

258
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,550
Shut up!!

259
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,710
Who do you think I am?

260
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,010
I am Otohime, the ruler of Ryugu!!

261
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,890
I am the most beautiful
creature in existence.

262
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,310
I must be beautiful!

263
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,060
What's this?

264
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,160
It's a man...

265
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,940
There's a man in there.

266
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,150
I wonder if it's a massage device.

267
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,530
I want to get one, too.

268
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,740
What kind of massage device
takes up this much space?!

269
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,230
This is something else.

270
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,140
It's probably a deep-freeze capsule,
or something like that.

271
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,950
Whatever the case, my back is worn out.

272
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,160
Hey, wait!! Don't touch anything!!

273
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,830
What's wrong?!

274
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,870
It's a Tengu!! It's cursed!!

275
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,040
What's this?

276
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,990
Something's written here.

277
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,530
Space century 079, July 15...

278
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,460
He still hasn't awakened.

279
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,970
According to the doctors, they've
managed to keep him alive,

280
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,510
but they don't know if he'll
regain consciousness.

281
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,760
It's all my fault.

282
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,600
I kept him in this palace too long.

283
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,450
He was left behind in his time.

284
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,270
He lost all hope and chose death.

285
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,500
Is this what Kamenashi-san
was talking about?

286
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,820
Believing that he'll regain
consciousness someday,

287
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,490
I've placed him in a cold sleep.

288
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,030
Now his body will never be destroyed.

289
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,890
He will continue to sleep
in his beautiful state,

290
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,890
never changing, until
the day he awakens.

291
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,780
But I don't know if I'm
doing the right thing.

292
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,470
He was so depressed about being
all alone and chose death.

293
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,100
Even if he wakes up in the far future,

294
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,230
he'll awaken in a completely
different world.

295
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,090
It'll be just like before only worse.

296
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,780
If that happens, what should I tell him?

297
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,270
I may be repeating the same mistake.

298
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,180
Even so... Even if I am... I...

299
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,780
It sure is beautiful...

300
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,530
It looks as if pearls have been
scattered, doesn't it?

301
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,150
This is one of the most famous
places in the universe.

302
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,660
This is the first time I've seen
something so beautiful.

303
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,160
Otohime-sama... You're...

304
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,820
absolutely beautiful.

305
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,200
I want to see him...

306
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,580
Once more...

307
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,500
No matter how many hundreds
or thousands of years it takes.

308
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,690
Countless men after him have
told me that same cheap line.

309
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,220
But his words... Why can't
I forget his words?

310
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,530
I've lived for thousands of
years, but his words...

311
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,210
I must live and stay beautiful.

312
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,180
No matter how many thousands
of years pass.

313
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,070
So that he can recognize me.

314
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,720
So that when he awakens,
he won't be lonely.

315
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,050
Even if the world changes,
I must remain the same.

316
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,250
I must wait for him looking as beautiful
as I was when he knew me.

317
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,350
I must let you know that
you're not alone...

318
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,690
that there was one person in this
world who was waiting for you.

319
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,290
I'll become the pearl that shines
in the depths of the sea.

320
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,260
Follow that light and return to me.

321
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,060
I'll always be waiting for you.

322
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,110
Otohime...

323
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,190
Ryugu Palace is shaking?!

324
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,040
What are these tremors?!

325
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,320
Hey!

326
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,590
No matter how much you
resist, it's useless.

327
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,520
Ryugu Palace will soon be above Edo.

328
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,770
The Heavenly Old Age Cannon
contains pressurized gas...

[Heavenly Old Age]

330
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,010
...the equivalent of 100,000
Treasure Box Gs.

331
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,910
If I fire this in the middle of Edo...

332
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,360
Everyone who remains on the surface
will become ugly and old.

333
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,920
Who would want that?

334
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,640
Who would want you to do that?!

335
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,750
Do you think the person
you're waiting for...

336
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,770
would really want you to
do such a terrible thing?!

337
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,180
I must be his guide.

338
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:10,180
I must be the most beautiful
pearl in this world.

339
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,000
The only thing that shines in
the dark depths of the ocean.

340
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,360
I'm sure he'll notice that light.

341
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,880
He'll follow that light and
come back to me.

342
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,790
In order to do that... In order to become...

343
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,830
the only shining pearl...

344
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,790
I need to sink everyone else
into the depths of the ocean.

345
