"The Benizakura."

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,570
It was forged by, Jintetsu, the best swordsmith in Edo.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,490
But it's said this feared "demon sword" sucks out people's souls.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,970
We, the Odd Jobs Trio, were asked to find the missing sword.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,600
We witnessed Nizo the Butcher using Benizakura for random murder.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,820
Gin-san was mortally wounded after an intense fight.

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,920
Kagura-chan, who went looking for the missing Katsura-san, hasn't returned.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,060
I kept searching and found a camouflaged ship docked in port.

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,600
Moreover, Tetsuko visited the Odd Jobs to report that her brother, Tetsuya,

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,470
was working with Takasugi's group on a terrible plan

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,980
to use the Benizakura to turn Edo into an inferno.

13
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,130
[Revenge against Takasugi's group. The Anti-Foreigner Faction fleet assault.]

14
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,000
[Takasugi's plans for a coup d'etat... Can Gintoki stop it?]

15
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,140
I'm relieved.

16
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,080
I was afraid you'd try to go out despite your injuries.

17
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,100
You'd die if you went out in your condition.

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,020
You're right.

19
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,620
I feel sorry for that girl, but it can't be helped.

20
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,030
...You're right.

21
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,580
Gin-san.

22
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,750
Huh?

23
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,670
Please don't overdo it.

24
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,510
If you die, Shin-chan and Kagura-chan would be lost without you, Gin-san.

25
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,010
...You're right.

26
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,720
Gin-san, you were pretty wild in your youth,

27
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,010
but you've got to start acting your age now, you know?

28
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,580
That's enough, damn it! I'm not going anywhere,

29
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,020
so just go out and buy me JUMP!

30
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,810
The last one you bought was an Akamaru JUMP.

31
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,900
That's the kind of mistake my mom would make!

32
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,380
Yes, yes. I understand.

33
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,310
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,910
Watch it, moron!

35
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,240
[Wait at the swordsmith's. -Odd Jobs guy]

36
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,100
I hate to behave like an impulsive punk at my age, but....

37
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,360
[This is my favorite umbrella. Please bring it back to me in one piece.]

38
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,960
Tsk... Troublesome woman...

39
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,810
Stupid Man...

40
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,620
["The Sun Will Rise Again"]

41
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,480
Is it the Shinsengumi? Don't tell me those Bukufu's dogs found out...

42
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,670
No, that's not it!

43
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,880
That's...!

44
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,740
Takasugi!

45
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,040
You bastard!

46
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,750
You're a samurai who has the same ambitions as us,

47
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,000
but you killed Kotaro Katsura, the leader of the Rebel Factions.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,160
That's unforgivable!!

49
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,760
We're not comrades anymore!

50
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,190
Our ambitions conflict so we're enemies now!

51
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,350
Now suffer the punishment of heaven!!

52
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,840
Where are you aiming?!

53
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,710
Whoa!

54
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,940
What?! Katsura's followers?!

55
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,980
Prepare the ship for departure immediately.

56
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,790
If they get off a shot from above, we're finished!

57
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,440
They came to avenge Katsura.

58
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,810
Nizo... This is all his fault.

59
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,820
It probably is. But it's more likely they found out about the Benizakura.

60
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,730
I heard that Katsura used to be an exclusionist rebel with radical ideas,

61
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,020
but these days, he's renounced extreme violence.

62
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,530
I think they're here to destroy the Benizakura,

63
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,640
and thwart our plans on behalf of the late Katsura.

64
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,070
No, Senpai.

65
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,770
It's possible this girl is one of their members

66
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,510
and this attack is just a diversion.

67
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,780
If that's the case, a rat may have snuck aboard this ship.

68
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,250
In any case, we can turn the tables on them.

69
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,140
Hey, listen up you rebels!

70
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,390
We know why you're here!

71
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,880
It's this girl, right?

72
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,220
We know you want to rescue her!

73
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,630
But if you keep shooting us you might accidentally hit her.

74
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,610
Takechi-senpai, that's not what was supposed to happen!

75
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,330
My expectations were off. But their cannonball missed so I guess we're even.

76
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,750
No, the screws in your head are missing!

77
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,480
You guys are so stupid!

78
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,970
I have nothing to do with those guys!

79
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,970
You guessed wrong. How embarrassing!

80
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,300
What are you gloating about?

81
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,190
You're the one in the most dangerous position.

82
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,920
Whoa! Incoming!

83
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,730
Hey, wait! What about me?!

84
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,990
Tsk. She didn't prove useful at all.

85
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,110
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kagura-chan!

86
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,010
Shinpachi!

87
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,990
Yo.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,140
I hate to bother you when you're suffering.

89
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,240
But your guests have arrived.

90
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,230
You really messed things up.

91
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,250
Now thanks to you, I have to fight these annoying fools

92
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,000
before we take on the Bakufu.

93
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,720
I heard you killed Katsura.

94
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,780
Moreover, you fought with Gintoki. You even used Tetsuya Murata.

95
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,270
So? Were you able to collect any good data?

96
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:03,990
Murata must be happy with it. He'd do anything to make his sword more deadly.

97
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,090
Humph... What about you?

98
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,660
Your old chum was killed so easily

99
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,570
so you're feeling sad...

100
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,610
Or...

101
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,120
That's an impressive arm you're growing there.

102
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,890
I'm glad you two get along so well together. You've literally become one.

103
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,060
Hurry up and go kill them.

104
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,520
If you wipe them out, I'll forget this matter.

105
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,570
I knew it would eventually come to this.

106
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,410
And...

107
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,900
Don't ever call Gintoki my chum again.

108
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,580
There're no warm feelings between us anymore.

109
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,430
Say it again and I'll cut right through you and that weird sword.

110
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,660
...He was seriously going to kill me...

111
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,810
Who are you?!

112
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,690
Hey!

113
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,910
Answer me!

114
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,650
Matako-san, we'd better focus on running, or we'll end up like that guy!

115
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,810
No! I'm falling!

116
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,710
Kagura-chan, I came here to save you. But now I need you to save me instead.

117
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,420
[Note: Kagura imitates Shinpachi's way of nicknaming her Kagura-chan by calling him Pa-chan]

118
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,560
This can't be happening, Pa-chan.

119
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,420
How can you be so easy-going right now?!

120
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,490
Shinpachi, I came all the way over here to find Zura, but I failed.

121
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,500
What happened to Zura? Where's Gin-chan? Why is Gin-chan not here?

122
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,790
Shinpachi...

123
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,280
Shi-Shinpachi!

124
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,980
Kagura-chan!

125
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,480
What's that?

126
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,270
That's Nizo! Nizo the Butcher!!

127
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,120
What is he going to do all by himself?!

128
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,040
Shoot him!

129
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,210
Blast him out of the sky!!

130
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,080
Hey...

131
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,150
Does killing such small fry satisfy you?

132
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,240
I'll destroy everything!

133
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,520
If you want to destroy something, why don't we...

134
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,330
destroy the world?

135
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,450
He did that with just one sword...

136
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,640
Is he a monster?!

137
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,050
Shinpachi!

138
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,700
Elizabeth!

139
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,670
You've made it all the way up here!

140
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,640
[I have to take care of something here.]

141
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,020
Elizabeth!

142
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,630
Hey, hey. When did this place become a costume party?

143
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,800
This is no place for kids.

144
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm no kid.

145
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,590
This smell...

146
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,810
I'm Katsura.

147
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,160
What are you doing?! Shoot him down!

148
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,020
We can't! He's moving so fast and the target is too small!

149
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,450
Come on, why are we having trouble with just one man?!

150
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,920
Shoot him down! Shoot him down!

151
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,960
Go, Benizakura!

152
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,990
Attention No. 3 fleet, disable steering! Everyone, retreat! Everyone, retreat!

153
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,460
How's that?

154
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,280
I've come to this stupid world for nothing but with Benizakura, I'll destroy everything.

155
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,380
This is...

156
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,310
Why now...?

157
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,630
Hey, hey, hey, hey. It looks like it's already started.

158
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,770
It's liable to be over before we get there.

159
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,650
One good swing with Benizakura has the same fighting power as 10 warships.

160
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,810
It's impossible for them to stop it.

161
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,340
I don't get it.

162
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,580
Can you compare it to something I'm more familiar with?

163
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,020
Its battle strength is equivalent to 1,000 mothers if their boobs were missiles.

164
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,290
Those aren't mothers!

165
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,790
A mother is supposed to be nagging, despotic, one-sided, unhearing of others, and...

166
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,690
Huh?!

167
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,810
Then it's not surprising that she can shoot missiles...

168
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,220
Take this...

169
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,170
What's this?

170
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,910
It's the sword I forged.

171
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,170
You can't defeat Benizakura with that wooden sword of yours. Use that.

172
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,540
The blade looks nice, but the hand guard looks like a pile of poo...

173
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,840
What the hell are you doing?!

174
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,310
It's not poop! It's a coiled dragon.

175
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,810
Hey, you! You said "poop" even before I finished saying "poop."

176
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,600
That means you were aware it looks like poop, right?!

177
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
Elizabeth-sama!

178
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,110
Elizabeth-san!!

179
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,000
The ship is ready.

180
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,050
But are you really sure you should go?

181
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,900
They've already destroyed two of our ships!

182
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,020
And our ship is not capable of loading enough heavy armaments.

183
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,510
I wonder what kind of terrifying weapons they have.

184
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,510
[I have to save those kids. If they die, I won't be able to face Katsura-san.]

185
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,250
You say you won't be able to face him, but Katsura-san is already...

186
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,480
[I sense a familiar presence aboard that ship.]

187
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,190
Elizabeth-san, don't tell me...!

188
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,410
You mean... Can it be?!

189
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,490
We can't just stand around!

190
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,550
Hurry, head to the ship!

191
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,570
Elizabeth-san's hunches often prove right.

192
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,670
Just the other day, I was at the horse races...

193
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,880
Shinsuke-sama!

194
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,910
Shinsuke-sama! Come on, Shinsuke-sama!

195
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,970
Oh... I didn't expect to see you here.

196
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,240
I didn't expect to meet a dead man.

197
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,480
No way...

198
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,090
Katsura-san!

199
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,350
I had unfinished business so I returned from the underworld.

200
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,430
I can't rest in peace after being slain by a comrade.

201
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,050
Right, Takasugi? Know what I mean?

202
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,760
A comrade...

203
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,570
I didn't know you still thought of us that way.

204
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,300
But that's an unwelcome thought.

205
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,810
You still carry that?

206
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,770
I guess we're both fools.

207
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,210
So that's what saved you from the Benizakura.

208
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,750
It's good to cherish old memories.

209
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,020
No, your henchman's incompetence saved me.

210
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,390
He was too eager.

211
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:21,990
He took my hair, but he left without making sure I was dead. Some butcher.

212
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,010
You're good at running away and now you're getting better at playing possum.

213
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,870
So, have you come all this way for revenge?

214
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,270
Do you think I was the one who sent him?

215
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,850
I don't care if you sent him or if it was his own decision.

216
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,910
But I know what you're planning and I can't let you do it.

217
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,180
I'm sending your ambitions to the bottom of the sea.

218
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,830
What's going on?!

219
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,620
The factory! The Benizakura!

220
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,270
Katsura!

221
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,170
You bastard! You'll never get off this ship alive!

222
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,380
Until I see the fall of Edo,

223
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,830
I can't die.

224
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,830
If Edo is awakened by barbarians like you guys, it would be repulsive.

225
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,390
So I'll kill you before the morning sun rises.

226
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,840
The person who's gonna get killed is...

227
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,850
...you!

228
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,850
We were worried sick about you!

229
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,230
And you were hiding inside Elizabeth?!

230
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,820
Take that, you inconsiderate jerk!!

231
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,880
Since when were you inside Elizabeth, anyway?

232
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,930
How long have you been playing us?

233
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,240
Hey, wait. Can't we talk about this later?

234
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,010
Look! These guys are about to attack us!

235
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,170
Shut up! We're about to attack you!

236
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,740
Wait! Calm down.

237
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,540
It wasn't fair that I didn't tell you anything. I apologize.

238
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,580
I thought the enemy was just after me.

239
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,970
So I thought it would be best if I made my enemy think I was dead.

240
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,640
That's why I didn't tell you anything.

241
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,840
And on top of that, I didn't want to get the others involved in my personal problems.

242
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,850
That's why I disguised myself as...

243
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,580
But why as Elizabeth?!

244
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,040
We can't get near him! He's a whirlwind of death!

245
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,660
What are you doing?!

246
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,560

247
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,020
Hey, that...looks like it's coming this way.

248
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,860

249
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,380
Takasugi! You ain't getting away with this!!

250
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,200
Tsk! Cut them down!!

251
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,780

[I can't stand this.]

253
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,170
I'm sorry, Katsura-san.

254
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,890
You ordered us not to take action under any circumstances.

255
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,490
But when we heard you were in trouble, we had to do something!

256
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,460
We couldn't believe you'd been killed and when we heard you were here...

257
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,810
Stop it.

258
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,210
There's no way I can blame you when you have such apologetic looks on your faces.

259
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,970
In fact, I'm the one who should apologize for keeping everyone in the dark.

260
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,970
[Shut up and fight!]

261
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,420
Katsura-san, you were trying to stop them all by yourself, weren't you?

262
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,610
You were trying to convince them to save your one-time comrade,

263
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,950
Takasugi, without making a big deal out of it, right?

264
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,790
Yet we attacked and ruined your plan!

265
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,100
Now the rift between our group and Takasugi's is even wider! So...

266
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,310
That's not true.

267
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,900
Something like this was bound to happen sooner or later anyways.

00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,490

273
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,440
We can't let you go!

274
