July 20th.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,860
Today, I'll be starting an observation journal
on a space morning glory today.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,650
I gave it lots of water so the morning
glory would bloom faster.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,840
How much longer?

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,300
When will I get to see the morning glory?

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,990
July 25th.

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,570
I woke up to find that the morning
glory had sprouted.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,860
Nice to meet you, Mr. Morning Glory.

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,260
I was so happy,
I gave it lots of water.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,200
And then Mom got mad at me.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,380
She said the morning
glory was already full.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,970
August 11th.

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,530
A typhoon hit Edo.

15
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,340
I stayed with the morning glory the whole
time so it wouldn't be blown away.

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,860
And then Mom got really mad at me.

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,160
She said I would catch a cold.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,610
But I was worried so I ignored her,

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,360
and then Mom and I got into a fight.

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,890
August 12th.

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,820
It was still raining.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,060
I was in bed all day with a fever.

23
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,310
I kept trying to go check
on the morning glory,

24
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,500
but Mom wouldn't let me go.

25
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,960
Mom didn't care what happened
to the morning glory.

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,940
I'm never gonna talk to Mom again...

27
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,410
August 13th.

28
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,710
I woke up to find that the
morning glory was gone.

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,760
The morning glory wouldn't have
died if I had stayed with it.

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

31
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,070
I was crying, when Mom brought a
fully-bloomed morning glory in a pot.

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,120
Mom had moved the morning glory
to a pot during the typhoon for me.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,110
She protected my friend in my place.

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,810
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,170
I still ended up crying.

36
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,400
But it wasn't because I was sad,
it was because I was happy.

37
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,630
August 30th.

38
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,010
I watered the morning glory with Mom.

39
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,920
The morning glory is still growing strong.

40

[Independent Research Project Presentation]

41
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,480
The end.

42
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,340
Okay, thank you, Hiroshi-kun.

43
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,590
It's nice that the morning glory didn't die.

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,170
Great!

45
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,230
And you made up with your mother.

46
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:13,970
Yes, a very well written report which
conveyed Hiroshi-kun's feelings.

47
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,480
Then next up is...

Daigoro-kun.

49
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,190
Yes.

50
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,680
Daigoro-kun, what did you
research this summer?

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,140
Uh...

52
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,960
I also did an observation journal.

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,390
I see. What did you observe?

54
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,210
Isn't everybody excited?

55
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,300
Well, Daigoro-kun, go ahead.

July 20th.

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,240
Today is the first day of my
long-awaited summer vacation.

59
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,830
How shall I have fun tomorrow?

60
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,980
I was so excited that I couldn't fall asleep

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,320
and missed my radio exercises.

62
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,070
Hey, Daigoro-kun!

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,070
You skipped radio exercises
on the very first day?

64
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,360
That's no good.

65
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,240
By the time I got to the park,
nobody was there.

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,620
But...

67
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,790
S-Sake...

68
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,700
P-Please...

69
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,030
G-Give me sake!

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,580
That was where I met Madao.

71
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,400
Uh...

72
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,360
What's a Madao?

73

["An Observation Journal Should
Be Seen Through To The Very End"]

74
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,830
July 21st.

75
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,830
I started an observation
journal on Madao today.

76
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,470
Daigoro-kun, hold on.

77
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,890
What's a Madao?

78
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,120
Madao is the master of the park.

79
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,960
A creature with a beard and sunglasses.

80
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,970
It sits in the park all day without working.

81
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,580
Daigoro-kun, that's just a
middle-aged man, yes?

82
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,210
An unemployed middle-aged
man living in the park, yes?!

83
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,420
I brought him alcohol from my house yesterday,
and he warmed up and started talking to me.

84
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,480
You shouldn't give stuff like
that to a strange old man!

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,570
Kid, where's the sake?

86
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,160
He said that he can't live without sake,

87
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,240
so I gave Madao lots of sake.

88
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,320
How much longer?

89
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,240
When will Madao bloom?

90
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,150
It won't!

91
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,000
As long as you keep giving him sake,
that old man will never bloom!

92
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,520
July 22nd.

93
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,530
Madao still hasn't sprouted.

94
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,550
Sprouted?

95
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,250
You shouldn't say that about
a grown man, Daigoro-kun.

96
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,090
I give it lots of sake but
it won't move or work.

97
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,690
I ask why it won't do anything...

98
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,320
Once a flower's withered,
it can never bloom again.

99
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,130
He answered me with a
sad look on his face.

100
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,760
What is this?! What kind
of project is this?!

101
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,270
How can he say such things to a child?!

102
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,610
July 23rd.

103
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,770
Madao still hasn't sprouted.

104
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,940
I give it lots of sake but it
all comes out of its eyes.

105
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,140
I ask why it spills back out
after I give it to him...

106
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,750
I'm sorry...

107
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,460
I won't waste any more...

108
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,170
I'm sorry...

109
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,000
And then more sake came from its eyes.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,150
Until the sunset.

111
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,630
Say, Daigoro-kun?

112
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,530
This is a little heavy, yeah? Yeah?

113
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,550
What is this? Could you stop?

114
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,990
July 24th.

115
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,010
Madao still hasn't sprouted.

116
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,420
Daigoro-kun, I get it now.

117
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,490
You skipped your independent
research project, didn't you?

118
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,360
Madao looked hurt.

119
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,360
That's it. Madao doesn't even exist.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,020
I ask what's wrong...

121
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,690
And it says that it screwed
up while making a swing.

122
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,870
Daigoro-kun!!

123
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,700
I ask why it's using a rope to make a swing
when the park already has swings.

124
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,590
When will Madao bloom?

125
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,560
Daigoro-kun, I don't like
where this is going!

126
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,880
Are you sure about this?!

127
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,400
July 25th.

128
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,460
Madao still hasn't sprouted.

129
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,110
I was on my way to do radio exercises when
I found Madao lying on the rail tracks.

130
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,460
I ask what's it's doing,

131
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,480
and it says it couldn't fall asleep
so it crawled over here.

132
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,260
Whoa!

133
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,560
Stop it!

134
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,130
When will Madao bloom?

135
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,560
That's enough, Daigoro-kun!

136
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,980
Report over.

137
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,950
An excellent job.

138
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,780
You aren't finished, but that's enough.

139
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,400
Why, Teacher?

140
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,390
I wanna hear more!

141
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,570
Did Madao bloom?

142
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,570
What happened?

143
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,320
It's not about it blooming or not.

144
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,440
More! I wanna hear more!

145
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,460
Finish the story, Daigoro!

146
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,000
Madao! Madao!

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,560
Madao! Madao! Madao! Madao!

148
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,430
Wh-What part of that touched
the hearts of the kids...?

149
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,240
I-I got it now!

150
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,770
Th-Then since it seems like your report
is rather long, we'll go with a summary.

151
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,420
Daigoro-kun, August.

152
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,650
Start from August.

153
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,710
Only read the important points, okay?

154
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,380
Skip the weird parts.

155
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,120
August 1st.

156
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,540
We have a new family member.

157
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,050
You skipped too much!!

158
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,220
How did Madao become a
member of your family?!

159
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,380
What happened in the days
that were skipped?!

160
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,570
A bed was prepared, but Madao
still hasn't sprouted.

161
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,990
Two dry eyes stare into the empty
sky, unable to perceive...

162
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,560
Much as God was unable to understand
the will of the fallen angel Lucifer...

163
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,390
And you're suddenly writing like a pro!

164
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,890
I've had enough...

165
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,540
I spit on the ground and
light up a xxxboro.

166
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,570
What happened?!

167
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,380
What happened over summer?!

168
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,230
This isn't a step towards being an adult!

169
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,520
It's a damn escalator!

170
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,960
Humans must change and adapt to their
environment in order to survive.

171
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,950
Why a condor?!

172
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,180
And you've changed way too much!

173
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,170
The man who refused to change and
stood still was practically a corpse.

174
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,380
You should've been observed instead!

175
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,210
August 3rd.

176
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,520
I casually tossed it a bottle of whiskey
I sniped from my mother.

177
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,440
Madao, I've changed your environment.

178
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,620
It's your turn to respond,
so why do you just lie there?

179
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,980
What damaged you?

180
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,940
Isn't that obvious?!

181
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,040
Madao didn't answer my question,

182
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,250
You can clearly see why he's unhappy!

183
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,010
instead it licked at the whiskey
with a sour look on its face.

184
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,530
This is what you meant by a
new member of the family?!

185
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,400
When will Madao bloom?

186
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,690
I look up at the sky to see a condor
circling as though laughing at me.

187
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,440
And why is there a condor in Edo?!

188
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,630
August 10th.

189
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,670
Ten days have passed since
we took in Madao.

190
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,540
It still hasn't sprouted.

191
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,780
As always, I casually toss it a bottle
of bourbon I swiped from my Mom.

192
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,030
Does it have to say "casually"?

193
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,960
Do you have to emphasize
that "casually" part?

194
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,880
Mom's been getting creeped
out by Madao recently.

195
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,220
It appears that she's realized I'm
keeping Madao and not a dog.

196
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,830
That should have been obvious
from the beginning!

197
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,650
She was creeped out from the beginning!

198
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,720
My Mom raised me on her own.

199
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,900
I wonder when she stopped
trusting in men...?

200
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,800
Who cares about your Mom's story!

201
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,090
Just end this story!

202
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,060
August 10th three years ago.

203
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,730
Hey! I said to stop!

204
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,450
Why is there a flashback
arc in your journal?!

205
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,400
I remember that it was
a blisteringly hot day.

206
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,420
My Mom's husband...

207
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,460
In other words, my old man,
was also a Madao.

208
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,470
My old man was a skilled carpenter,

209
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,140
but after an accident left
his arms paralyzed,

210
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,510
he stopped working and began drinking
and gambling during the day.

211
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,220
My Mom always worked hard,

212
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,770
buy my old man would beat
her for not earning enough.

213
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,410
I couldn't stand the sight of my old man,

214
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,940
so I never returned home
until the sun set.

215
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,240
I would wait for my exhausted
Mom before heading home.

216
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,220
That was my daily routine.

217
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,800
But we didn't abandon that Madao,
because of memories of long ago...

218
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:39,150
We believed that he would return to
being a kind father, a kind husband.

219
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,770
But that day...

220
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,140
We're home.

221
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,400
Our faint hopes

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,750
vanished into the summer sky
with the cries of cicadas.

223
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,560
Raindrops trickled down my cheek.

224
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,860
Before I knew it, I had told the Madao
before me about the other Madao.

225
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,910
Sorry, forget about everything I just said.

226
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,040
Why did you help me...?

227
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,320
Aren't you sick of seeing a Madao?

228
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,610
Both you and your mother.

229
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,800
Aren't you making your mother suffer?

230
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,350
I might be feeling remorse...

231
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,790
If only I had provided support for my
old man when he hit rock bottom...

232
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,580
Then my Mom wouldn't
have suffered like this.

233
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,120
I couldn't say anything more...

234
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,870
At some point, I may have seen
my old man in Madao.

235
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,500
What was I trying to accomplish
while making my Mom suffer?

236
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,230
Was I trying to recover what
I'd once forgotten...?

237
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,650
On that day, Madao didn't
touch its bourbon.

238
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,990
August 11th.

239
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,420
I awake to the sound of rain
pounding against the window.

240
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,090
It seems that a typhoon has hit Edo.

241
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,190
My legs led me to the doghouse.

242
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,770
But Madao was nowhere to be found.

243
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,690
Aren't you sick of seeing a Madao?

244
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,900
Both you and your mother.

245
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,820
What are you doing?!

246
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,750
Where are you going in this rain?!

247
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,070
Let me go!

248
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,610
It's already weak from
drinking all that booze!

249
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,550
Madao's going to die in this rain!

250
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,550
So that was a Madao...

251
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,050
No!

252
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,960
It's not a Madao!

253
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,790
It's... It's...

254
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,780
My friend!

255
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,280
Daigoro!

256
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,060
No more of this...

257
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,530
I have to save him!

258
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,840
August 12th.

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,760
I couldn't find Madao in the end.

260
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,590
My head hurts and I can't write
as well as I did before.

261
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,750
I seem to have caught a cold.

262
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,840
I didn't drink any sake, but it's coming
out of my eyes for some reason.

263
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,650
Just like it did with Madao.

264
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,570
Is sake coming out of Madao's
eyes wherever he is?

265
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,860
When I thought of that, I couldn't
stop the sake from coming out.

266
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,780
And then...

267
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,380
Ma-Madao...

268
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,980
Honestly...

269
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,880
Next time keep an eye on
it so it won't escape.

270
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,980
And also...

271
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,520
If you're going to keep a Madao, keep
it inside so we aren't embarrassed.

272
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,720
And feed it properly instead
of giving it alcohol.

273
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,080
Mom allowed me to keep Madao.

274
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,310
Or maybe Mom felt the same way I did.

275
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,810
Madao, were you drinking again?

276
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,580
No...

277
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,580
No more drinking for me.

278
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,990
August 20th.

279
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,360
Madao has changed since then.

280
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,390
He no longer drinks sake,

281
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,960
and he performs all kinds of
chores while Mom is out.

282
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,760
All while reading the classifieds.

283
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,800
Mom called him Madao in the beginning,

284
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,570
but she's started to call
him Hasegawa-san.

285
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,400
Here, Hasegawa-san.

286
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,040
Ah, sorry about that. Thank you so much.

287
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,010
Madao is Madao, so why?

288
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,210
I don't really get it.

289
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,220
August 25th.

290
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,600
When Madao went out for
errands that evening,

291
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,680
Mom asked...

292
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,900
Daigoro.

293
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,080
Would you like a father?

294
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,870
That was her question.

295
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,240
I didn't understand what she meant,

296
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
so I asked her about it

297
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,790
and then her face turned red.

298
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,250
Well, it's nothing...

299
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,820
I didn't understand,

300
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,260
so I asked Madao that night...

301
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,030
I wouldn't know.

302
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,010
I don't really get grownups.

303
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,660
August 26th.

304
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,750
It's finally the day for Madao to sprout.

305
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,940
Thank you for everything you've done.

306
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,250
Thanks to you two, I've been able
to recover from hitting rock bottom.

307
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,590
I don't know how to show
my appreciation...

308
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,850
My, it's a little early for that.

309
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,700
You haven't gone to your interview yet.

310
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,290
There, your tie.

311
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,120
Sorry about that.

312
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,500
Only one person will be
able to pass, right?

313
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,220
Do your best.

314
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,510
We'll be waiting for the good news.

315
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,260
Yes!

316
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,310
As Madao headed off to battle
and Mom watched him go,

317
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,170
they were like father and mother.

318
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,610
Madao as my father...

319
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,280
I tried to picture that, but
it felt weird so I stopped.

320
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,770
You seem to be nervous.

321
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,300
Huh? Oh, yes...

322
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,110
Since my return to a normal person
from being a Madao is riding on this.

323
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,320
Oh, is that so?

324
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,480
I'm the same.

325
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,900
Oh? You were also a Madao?

326
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,710
I couldn't tell...

327
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,960
Well, I lost my job after an
injury and snapped...

328
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,730
My wife and son gave up on me...

329
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't realize
what was important until I'd lost it all...

330
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,180
I managed to straighten myself up and
asked my wife if we could start over,

331
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,850
but she told me to let her think about it.

332
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,510
Well, it's okay.

333
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,940
I'll try again if I'm accepted here.

334
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,950
There's only one opening, but let's both
do our best so we have no regrets.

335
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,540
Um... Can I ask you something?

336
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,500
Yes?

337
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,910
What's your son's name?

338
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,820
August 27th.

339
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,180
Madao never came back.

340
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,820
He probably didn't pass the interview.

341
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,690
So he's too ashamed to face us.

342
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,140
Madao's such an idiot.

343
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,710
He doesn't need to be so sensitive.

344
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,630
Mom didn't say anything.

345
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,220
Was Mom hurt again because of me?

346
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,720

347

We ate with Madao.

The other Madao.

349
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,870
Madao had become a completely
different person.

350
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,200
After apologizing to Mom
and me over and over,

351
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,630
he happily reported that he'd found a job.

352
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,000
He also cheerfully told
us about someone

353
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,210
who got drunk and made
a ruckus at the interview.

354
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,460
Mom also looked like
she was really happy.

355
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,540
Yo, you two.

356
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,150

Why?

360
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,410
You promised never to drink again.

361
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,690
Why?

362
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,940

Let's go.

Don't bother with him any longer.

I know that Madao is no Madao!

378
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,270

I'd once forgotten!

379
