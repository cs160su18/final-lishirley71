Happy Birthday to me!

Today, June 26 is my, Kotaro
Katsura's, birthday.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,800
So today, during the final week
of Katsura Enrichment Month,

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,330
we will be airing 30 full minutes
of "KatsuraTama."

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,140
Now I know you're all anxious to see it,

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,930
so let's start with the answer
to last week's question.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,830
Cut that out, you!
"Katsura Enrichment Month" my ass!

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,180
What's with "KatsuraTama"?!
Can't even pronounce it!

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,290
You could've at least
named it "ZuraTama"!

18
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,940
I'm not Zura, I'm Katsura.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,580
Don't be so cold, Gintoki.

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,200
Aren't we "brothers" who fought together
in the Anti-Foreigner War?

21

Shut up! I'm not gonna
put up with your crap!

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,160
In the first place,

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,850
it's your fault the show was on a two-week
hiatus at the start of this month!

Here!

39

Okay, let's move on to the next one.

The second place is...

41
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,300
Well, all kinds of things were happening,
but it was good for Agomi-san.

42

Why'd you arm a robot maid
with those weapons?

I had old man Gengai modify
her for rent collection.

or a cat, you know.

She's a big help. She works
hard, and she's considerate.

99

I like the fact that she works hard,

100
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,190
but that girl only works for people and
doesn't ever think about herself.

it arduous and tiring.

What're you doing?

116

Otose-sama told me to take
a break once in a while.

117

She gave me 72 hours -no, 69 hours
23 minutes...22 minutes-off...

118

But a robot maid's job
is to work for people.

119
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,880
So you've been sitting here doing
nothing for two-and-a-half hours?!

120
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,900
Gintoki-sama, what exactly am I supposed
to be doing on a break?

121
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,760
Did Otose-sama dispose of me?

122
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,150
The old lady probably wants you to let
loose and have some personal time.

123
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,030
Though I think it's a cruel
thing to say to a robot.

124
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,480
What do I let loose?

125

If you don't have anything to
do, then don't do anything.

129
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
The idea is to be at your most relaxed.

130
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,090
I understand. I should
do nothing, correct?

131
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,330
Right, exactly. See you.

You really don't understand!
You're hopeless! Hopeless!

133
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,100
Someone who works really hard knows
how to let the air out sometimes!

134
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,600
Let the air out? I'm a robot,
so I do not pass gas.

I'm not talking about farts!

136
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,500
What I'm trying to say is that a balloon
will burst if it's full of too much air.

137
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,940
To inflate it again, you have to
let out some air. Understand?

138
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,310
Does your balloon have a
hole in it, Gintoki-sama?

139
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,330
I've never seen it full.

140
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,100
My balloon is bigger than other people's.

141
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,050
That's why it doesn't fill up. I'm going
to whack you, you bucket of bolts!

I'll add that to my data.

swell even if he dies.

go or something you'd like to do?

155
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,750
Sure. Order anything you want.

156
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,710
What is this place?

157
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,720
A place to drink, make merry,
and enjoy yourself.

158
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,570
Why is drinking and merrymaking
enjoyable?

159
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,430
Because it takes your mind
off the gloom, of course.

160
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,270
What is "gloom"? There are so
many things I do not know.

161
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,450
Do you think I should request
additional memory?

162
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,020
What you lack isn't memory;
you lack fun!

163
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,810
Anyway, I'm enjoying myself.

164
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,180
By allowing me to enjoy myself, you're
helping me. Do you understand?

165
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,370
If you are enjoying yourself, Gintoki-sama,
then I think that is good.

166
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,410
However, all I am doing is sitting,
so it is uncomfortable for me.

167
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,190
I feel a desire to work.

168
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,250
Is there any work I can do?

169
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,460
Forget it!

170
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,450
Sitting here is the customer's "work."

171
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,980
Oh, Gin-san...

172
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,830
...is that you?

173
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,320
Tsk.

174
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,170
Who is this?

175
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,170
I am Gintoki-sama's enjoyment.

176
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,140
What?

177
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,100
That's not right! Be more specific!

178
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,460
To be more specific,

179
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,440
in order for Gintoki-sama
to enjoy himself,

180
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,550
I am suppressing the desires
that well up inside of me,

181
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,900
and I have been ordered to sit still.

182
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,680
Just a minute. What? That's not
it! Not it! That's not how it is!

183
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,270
What is that look in your eyes,

184
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,770
like you've seen something
immoral and illegal?!

185
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,300
Like I'm an old man who
tricked a young girl

186
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300
and brought her to a hostess
club to enjoy her reaction.

187
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,110
That sort of perverted play?

188
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,170
This establishment does
not allow individuals

189
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,520
who violate public order and morals.

190
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,400
Wait! Wait! Wait!

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,010
She's a robot.

192
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,230
She had all this money saved up

193
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,840
and said she didn't know how
to enjoy spending it, so I...

194
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,730
Oh? So what you're saying is...

195
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,680
She's a robot and ignorant
about dealing with money,

196
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,920
so you're taking advantage and making
her pay for your amusement?

197
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,390
Right, right!

198
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,770
You should be ashamed!

199
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,830
Regardless of whether she's
a robot or whatever,

200
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,860
a guy who tries to trick a
woman out of her money

201
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,870
deserves to have his butt
hairs yanked out.

202
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,800
By the end of tomorrow, bring every last
yen of the money you spent today.

203
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,000
Do come again.

204
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,930
Gintoki-sama, part of you
does inflate all the way...

205
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,560
Your face.

206
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,270
Isn't there anything you want?

207
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,190
You have the money, so why don't
you buy something you want?

208
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,610
Something I want?

209
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,560
Yeah. There's no such thing as a woman
who hates shopping, right?

210
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,750
I'll show you around.

211
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,540
You're always wearing the same clothes.

212
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,110
Wear something fashionable
now and then.

213
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,420
How about this one?

214
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,140
Hey you, the creepy clerk over
there-sell me this cheap.

215
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,170
There's a booger on it.

216
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,580
You're the one who put it there!

217
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,430
Read the situation, you creep.

218
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,760
This child, with her entry-level salary,

219
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
wants to buy a kimono for mother
back home in the country...

220
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,420
What're you talking about? What girl?

221
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,630
Huh?

222
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,150
Buy this! You booger brain!

223
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,390
Hey, what're you doing? Did you
find something you want...?

224
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,680
[Sale! Screws 300 yen each]

225
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,890
No, I...never mind. It's not
that I want it or anything.

226
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,140
I forgot to bring my money.

227
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,450
I see. Then let's go...

228
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,250
Hey, you're dripping something.

229
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,570
It's nothing. It's just oil.

230
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,270
Okay, I get it!

231
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,900
Which is it? Which one do you want?

232
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,780
Okay, already, I'll buy it for
you! But why a screw?!

233
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,260
This one feels solid in my hand,

234
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,070
but this one is hard to put down, as well.

235
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,440
Which one do you think
matches me better?

236
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,030
They're both the same!

237
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,090
They're completely different.

238
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,470
Fella, could you be searching
for an engagement screw?

239
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,880
What's an engagement screw?
Never heard of it.

240
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,790
You have good taste, Miss,
for choosing that screw.

241
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,290
That one has a story behind it.

242
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,060
[Note: Parody of famous story. Hideyoshi Toyotomi heated
his lord, Nobunaga's straw sandals in his pocket.]

243

That screw was part of the machine
that built the machine

[This was filmed under expert supervision.
Please do not try this yourselves.]

245
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,970
that built the microwave oven
that Hideyoshi Toyotomi,

246
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,560
concerned about his lord's feet,

247
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,060
used one cold winter night to heat
Nobunaga's straw sandals.

248
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,930
That's about as ordinary
a screw as they come!

249
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,790
Why was Hideyoshi nuking a pair of
straw sandals, anyway?! Let's go!

250

Relax...

255
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,180
I drank too much oil.

256

I told you, you shouldn't mix
high-octane with regular!

I'm sorry. I tried so hard to let loose.
Gintoki-sama. Did I succeed?

258
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,080
It's not about trying to let loose.

259
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,410
But I'm a robot, so if I'm not
of any use to anyone,

260
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,090
there's no reason for me to exist.

261
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,800
You and Otose-sama have
tried so hard to help me.

262

If I don't live up to your expectations...

Thank you for buying me this screw.

...Yeah...

266
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,730
Do you know just how many people's
lives this screw is supporting?

267
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,150
It's the basis for creating the framework of
all sorts of things like houses and vehicles.

268
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,700
There is nothing that better personifies

the spirit of desiring to
be helpful to people.

This is how we robots want to be.

We want to be the screw

Tama, look.

Maybe household appliances need to have
it all together in order to be useful.

275
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,040
But there are those that fulfill their
purpose simply by being there,

276
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,680
simply by smiling.

277

you to understand.

320
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,050
You're already disgusting enough.

321
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,880
What?!
