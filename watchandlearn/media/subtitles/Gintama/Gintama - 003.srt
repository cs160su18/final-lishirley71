And so outside of certain areas,

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,930
we kicked off the Gin Tama anime series with a one hour special full of non-stop laughs and excitement.

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,080
This time, we'll be taking a trip back to when Gin and I first met.

7
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,530
A samurai's sword is not something that is kept in a sheath.

8
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,640
It's something that you hold in your soul.

9
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,850
These days, samurai aren't needed.

10
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,560
But no matter how much times change, there are things that people mustn't forget.

11
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,260
Even if there comes a time when you must give up your sword,

12
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,950
you must never lose the unwavering sword kept in your soul.

13

15

I wish I could've seen it one last time.

16
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,540
The land of the samurai.

17
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,600
There was a time, long ago, when our country was called by that name.

18
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,580
Those dream-filled blue skies upon which the samurai once gazed,

19
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,050
are now filled with ships from strange worlds.

20
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,610
The towns where the samurai once proudly walked

21
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,890
are now filled with swaggering, arrogant aliens.

22
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,950
This is our world today. This is...

23
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,650
...our city.

Loser! You're still clinging to your sword?!

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,650
Samurai and swords are all ancient history now!

31
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,460
How long are you going to act as if you're a samurai?! Huh?

Just leave it at that, boss.

Sir, you mustn't go so easy on him.

38
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,470
Nah, just that lately whenever I see a samurai,

39
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,120
I feel kind of sorry for them.

40
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,650
When we first came here, the samurai were always spoiling for a fight.

41
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,610
But, now, it's as if we've lost an irritable friend. It's lonely.

42
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
So I end up wanting to mess with them.

43
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,350
Twenty years ago, aliens called the Amanto suddenly came to Edo.

44
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,090
The rise of the Amanto led to the decline of the samurai.

45
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,090
What are you doing, Shinpachi?!

46
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,340
We were stripped away of our swords and status

47
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,840
and we abandoned our honor and everything else.

48
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,620
No, it wasn't only the samurai.

49
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,770
It was everyone in this country...

50

162
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,740
Today I'm definitely going to make you pay me back.

163
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,000
I can't take it anymore!

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,640
Now I'm really getting irritated!

165
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,420
Hey, are you in debt?

166
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,470
You're leading pretty dangerous lives, for a couple of kids...

167
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,470
We didn't do it. It was Father...

168
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,140
Shin!

169
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,760
What the hell are you blabbering about?!

170
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,060
Hurry up and bring me my money, stupid!

171
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,630
I gotta get home, my favorite soap opera is on.

172
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,880
Wait a minute, today is...

173
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,850
Shut up!

174
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,920
I've been waiting ever since your pop was still alive!

175
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,390
I'm starting to go bald!

176
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,650
You promised that you'd sell the dojo if you couldn't pay!

177
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,000
You're going to keep that promise!

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,550
Wait a moment...

179
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,620
Why?! That's good enough, isn't it?

180
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,680
You don't need to feel obligated to your stupid father

181
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,270
who left you nothing but debt when he died!

182
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,910
Get rid of this dojo.

183
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,240
You little... What the hell are you doing?!

184
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,410
Sis!

185
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,880
You fool...

186
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,750
Do you think that I won't hurt you

187
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,300
just because you're a woman?!

188
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,820
What?!

189
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,380
That's enough.

190
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,700
Even though she was raised by gorillas, she's still a woman.

191
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,070
Who the hell are you?!

192
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,370
Does this dojo still have students?!

193
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,820
Honestly, the lot of you...

194
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,160
Forget the dojo!

195
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,960
But I'm going to make you work to pay off your debt.

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:54,490
[High-Leg Shabu Shabu Heaven]

197
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,770
I've started a new business.

198
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,790
It's called High-Leg Shabu Shabu Heaven.

199
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,400
H-High Leg?!

200
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,180
Wh-Why?!

201
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,100
Because I like girls in high-leg outfits, of course!

202
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,740
[Heaven]

203
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,700
Well, simply put, it's a flying nightclub.

204
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,930
Technically, they're prohibited in Edo now.

205
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,080
But if it's in the sky, it'll be out of sight from government officials.

206
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,650
I can do whatever I want.

207
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,580
It'll be shabu shabu time while I get to stare at girls in high-leg outfits!

208
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,520
I'll ensnare my customers with sleaze!

209
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,260
I've gathered beauties from many worlds, but you'd be more than welcome.

210
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,680
Well, it comes down to either selling this dojo or selling yourself.

211
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,270
Which will it be?

212
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,370
No way!

213
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,550
She'd never do something like that.

214
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,290
All right. I'll go.

215
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,310
What a dutiful daughter you are.

216
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,570
Hold on... Sis!

217
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,160
Why would you do this?!

218
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,450
We've done enough, haven't we?!

219
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,000
Hey!

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Sis!

221
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,710
Shin, it's as you say.

222
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,610
Nothing good will come from saving this dojo...

223
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,540
...only pain.

224
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,430
But it's also painful to let go.

225
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,670
It's painful to keep or to discard something that you can never get back...

226
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,360
If it's going to be painful either way,

227
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,570
I'd rather suffer trying to protect it.

228
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,990
What the hell?! Damn it!

229
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,160
My stupid sister!

230
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,900
She keeps talking about Father.

231
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,160
What did baldy ever do for us?!

232
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,670
He only played Othello with us once in a while!

233
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,240
Was your dad bald?

234
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,240
Well, he was mentally bald.

235
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,480
Hey, you're still here?!

236
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,010
And why are you cooking in my house?!

237
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,780
Well, I can't go on without eating something sweet periodically.

238
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,040
Then make something easier!

239
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,350
Shouldn't you go after your sister?

240
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,610
I don't care.

241
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,370
It was her decision to leave.

242
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,300
She really is my Father's daughter.

243
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,840
She's just like him.

244
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,650
Father was a good-natured person who always talked about duty and compassion.

245
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,120
Because of that, he got taken advantage of and died in debt.

246
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,490
Why was he so careless?

247
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,220
I don't want to die with only grand principles to my name.

248
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,370
But no matter how much times change,

249
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,860
there are things that people mustn't forget.

250
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,770
Does a child really need a reason to protect the things that its parents cherished?

251
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,710
That kind of thinking only gets in the way nowadays.

252
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,340
I plan on living smarter and longer.

253
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,200
Is that so?

254
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,510
But you don't seem very smart to me.

255
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,750
Samurai don't need a reason to act.

256
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,380
If they have something they have to protect, they should draw their sword.

257
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,310
Do you love your sister?

258
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,860
"Watch the beautiful sunset from heaven,"

259
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,120
"first boat leaves this afternoon at four."

260
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,920
This is bad!

261
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,080
The ship's about to leave! Can't you go any faster?!

262
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,750
Hey, safety first. That's my motto...

263
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,590
It'll also hurt if we crash.

264
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,310
Now's not the time to be saying that!

265
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,150
Sis is in high-leg shabu shabu danger!

266
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,180
Hey! You, without the helmet, stop!

267
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,290
What are you saying?

268
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,250
We don't need road traffic laws in this day and age.

269
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,410
That's true, but it'll hurt if you crash.

270
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,350
I'm just telling you because I'm concerned.

271
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,990
I'm all right. I have a hard head.

272
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,350
Huh?! What?!

273
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,390
I'm trying to be considerate!

274
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,400
It really hurts! It's terrible!

275
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,500
Shut up.

276
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,640
I'm telling you that...

277
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,010
...it's hard!

278
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,940
I've got a nose bleed! I've got a nose bleed! And at my age!

279
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,540
The Shabu Shabu Heaven has taken off!

280
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,080
What are we going to do?! It's so high up!

281
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,990
Sis!

282
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,260
Damn him... Mocking me like that!

283
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,180
After him!

284
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,810
Yes, sir!

285
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,930
Hey, you!

286
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,280
Do you think that you can outrun the police?!

287
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,460
[Oedo Police]

288
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,930
I'm Otae. Please treat me gently.

289
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,520
I told you, that's not how you do it!

290
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,510
You're supposed to show more cleavage there! Stupid!

291
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,490
I've never had cleavage before in my life!

292
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,820
Oh, sorry. You couldn't show any even if you wanted to.

293
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,460
Fine! Next we'll work on your technique!

294
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,690
It's time to put on your high-leg outfit and give us some shabu shabu heaven!

295
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,150
Hold on... That cut is...

296
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,770
This cut is what we're going for.

297
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,270
What's wrong? Put it on already.

298
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,470
If you've lost your nerve now, it's too late!

299
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,750
If you think that I'm going to go easy on you just because we're on prime-time, you're mistaken.

300
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,050
This is for your dojo. So buck up, little soldier!

301
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,730
What's that?!

302
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,460
Hold on. What's going on?!

303
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,950
Boss! What's going on?!

304
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,150
A car crashed into us.

305
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,680
This is bad. It's a police car!

306
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,740
The cops are onto us!

307
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,840
Don't worry. It's just a rental.

308
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,320
Hello. Odd Jobs at your service!

309
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,440
Sis! You haven't put on that high-leg outfit yet, right?!

310
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,530
Shin?!

311
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,380
What the hell are you doing?!

312
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,430
We've come to get my sister back!

313
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,640
You idiot!

314
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,780
Don't any of you understand that it's too late already?!

315
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,400
Your dojo won't be any safer after this!

316
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,210
I don't care about the dojo.

317
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,320
I want a dojo where my sister is always smiling.

318
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,690
If I have to see my sister cry...

319
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,840
I don't need the dojo!

320
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,320
Shin...

321
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,120
Fool! What can just the two of you do?

322
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,510
Get them!

323
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,480
Hey, I'll distract 'em.

324
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,760
Go find an escape pod or something and get outta here.

325
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,270
Wh-What about you?

326
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,210
You just think about protecting your sister.

327
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,280
I'll protect what I want to protect.

328
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,600
What the hell are you going on about?

329
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,770
Die!

330
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,740
All right! Next!

331
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,850
Who is this guy?!

332
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,440
What?

333
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,010
H-His style is crazy...

334
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,650
...but strong!

335
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,980
Shinichi! Go!

336
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,320
It's "Shinpachi," you idiot!

337
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,710
Shin!

338
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,090
Will he be all right?

339
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,120
Why is he doing this for us?

340
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,780
I don't know!

341
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,610
But he'll come back!

342
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,360
Because I sense it in him!

343
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,080
The thing that Father talked about.

344
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,320
He really came back!

345
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,700
That was tough! It was far tougher than I thought!

346
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,080
Try a little harder! You didn't even last a minute!

347
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,190
You idiot! It's really tough to make a minute-long anime!

348
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,420
Just find an escape pod right now!

349
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,220
Where are we?

350
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,840
The engine room?!

351
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,740
It's a dead end.

352
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,030
Let's end this game of tag.

353
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,770
How pathetic...

354
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,020
The samurai who once protected the country with their swords

355
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,420
are now good-for-nothings who can't even protect a single girl.

356
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,730
There's nothing for you to protect.

357
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,750
This country... This sky, they all belong to us, the Amanto.

358
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,210
The country? The sky?

359
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,620
You can have 'em.

360
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,060
I'm busy protecting the things in front of me.

361
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,870
I don't know how many things I have failed to protect.

362
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,340
I don't have anything left, but at least if I find something falling before me...

363
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,950
I want to pick it up!

364
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,580
What pathetic warrior spirit... I've had enough of you!

365
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,180
Die!

366
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,600
Hold on... Sir, no!

367
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,180
What'll happen if we hit the you-know-what?

368
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,750
We'll die along with the ship.

369
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,990
O-Oh no, I forgot...

370
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,990
Hey, he's climbing it! Hey!

371
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,990
Hey, wait!

372
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,490
That's not good! That's the ship's engine core.

373
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,810
What's precious to my client is precious to me.

374
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,910
In order to protect them...

375
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,120
I'll do...

376
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,870
...anything!

377
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,740
No! He really did it!

378
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,520
What is this floating sensation? I feel sick!

379
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,460
Is this thing falling?! Are we falling?!

380
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,090
Luckily we were over the ocean, but...

381
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,390
...who knows what would have happened if we had fallen on the town.

382
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,630
I've never seen such a crazy samurai.

383
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,550
But...

384
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,250
In the end, he saved us.

385
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,080
What?!

386
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,030
I aided in the arrest of ruffians who were disturbing the peace in Edo!

387
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,720
You can let the fact that I borrowed a police car slide!

388
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,780
"Borrowed"? My car and I are a complete wreck!

389
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,210
You've always been a wreck! You actually look even better like that.

390
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,780
Seriously?! What part?

391
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,420
Sis, I...

392
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,270
Go.

393
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,430
You found something in him, right?

394
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,330
Go and find your sword.

395
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,060
I'll look for it my own way.

396
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,600
It's all right. I won't do anything rash anymore.

397
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,020
I don't want to see you cry either.

398
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,930
Sis...

399
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,630
Even if there comes a time when you must give up your sword,

400
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,170
you must never lose the unwavering sword kept in your soul.

401
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,010
Father.

402
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,300
What sort of soul does this guy have? It's very difficult to tell.

403
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,170
I think it's dim but it's definitely shining.

404
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,290
Right now, I think I'd like to watch it shine for a while.

405
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,650
[Preview]

406
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,590
Oh no! I forgot that Jump goes on sale today!

407
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,450
Should I use this opportunity to grow out of it?

408
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,000
No! Men are boys at heart until they die!

409
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,690
The next episode:

410
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,090
"Watch Out! Weekly Shonen JUMP Sometimes Comes Out on Saturdays!"

411
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:47,100
A super strong beautiful heroine who's a big eater? Kagura appears!!

412
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,100
Come over again, Sorachi-san. Next time, let's go to that store.

413
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,610
I wish I could shoot something like Getsuga Tensho, too...
