2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,300
Boy, the year's already over, huh?

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,510
Sure was fast.

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,080
I hate how the years go by faster as we get older.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,870
At this rate, by the time I'm an old geezer,

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,350
the years will pass at the speed of a Formula 1 car.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,760
I've still got a long ways to go.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,170
Well, I'm already up to Ben Johnson speed, I'd say.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,270
My Ben Johnson is already up to here.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:37,280
[Note: In Japanese, Ben also refers to Poop. So here Gin is referring to his incontinence.]

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,480
Don't get too cocky because you're all still young.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,770
Your Ben Johnson will fall behind soon enough.

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,040
For real?

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,280
Ben Johnson's gonna fall out?

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,590
I prefer Carl Lewis over Ben Johnson.

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,440
He's cooler.

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,830
Well, all I'm saying is, we all had a pretty good year, right?

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,020
Hell no!

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,360
It's still February!

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,150
And didn't we have the exact same conversation last year?!

21
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,640
That's 'cause this whole segment was recycled.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,740
Yeah.

23
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Not just the lines, but also the video's the same too.

24
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,290
That's even more of a half-assed job!

25
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,020
They've been working hard on this anime.

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,140
But you know...

27
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,500
Once we got into the Yoshiwara arc, it's been battle after battle every week.

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,880
Not that I really mind since it's all cool like a real JUMP anime,

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,160
but the staff was like...

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,930
"If we don't throw in a little break, we're going to go over budget."

31
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,520
I keep telling you...

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,430
Stop talking about money on TV.

33
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,730
I mean, it's ridiculous to ask for the same number of battles as "XXX" when we only have half the budget.

34
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,150
Our budget was set on the premise that there would be loads of talking.

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,750
We're in our fourth year while running the original production costs,

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,480
and we're still using a 4:3 aspect ratio.

37
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,900
That's perfect for our piece of crap TV.

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,490
[Note: Hi-Vision is the Japanese equivalent to Hi-Def.]

39
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,190
We live in a time where there's Hi-Vision and Blu-ray.

40
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,490
Who makes anime that isn't 16:9 these days?

41
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,560
Hold it, did you just say "our fourth year"?

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,390
Wasn't this show supposed to end in March?

43
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,270
Season 3 ends in March.

44
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,370
And then Season 4 starts in April.

45
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,070
Man, I was hoping for something like "Mito Komon" where every time a season ended,

46
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:17,600
[Note: These terms refers to classic Samurai TV shows that have a break between seasons.]

47
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,490
they threw in "Ohoka Echizen" or "Edo wo Kiru" until the next season started.

48
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,600
If we alternated like that, we could get up to thirty-nine seasons...

49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,620
Like hell, we could!

50
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,160
And did you all trick me?!

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,840
You're telling me that whole "Final Chapter" crap was really Season 3?!

52
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,260
What kind of series finale scam is this?!

53
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,510
Anyone would be fooled!!

54
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,090
Our "Mito Komon style production" plan failed.

55
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,470
And here we carefully planned out this anime to be a long-running series...

56
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,580
under the assumption that the manga would run for over three decades!

57
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,920
Besides, thanks to you guys falling for this kind of marketing covers,

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,810
and buying all our DVDs, our original plan got all screwed!!

59
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,320
Hey! Hey!! HEY!!! Who the hell are you complaining to?!

60
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,540
Stop buying DVDs, people.

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,880
And so, since our plan for a long-running series with a short break every season has failed,

62
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,680
the Gin Tama anime will take an alternate route in its fourth year!

63
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,650
Alternate route?

64
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,620
When an anime catches up to a manga that's still running,

65
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:10,020
it must take a roundabout path to stay within reach of the manga before it can rejoin the manga.

66
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,020
However, there are a number of risks.

67
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,500
The anime could buy enough time for the manga to move on, only to be canceled.

68
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,190
Or the manga ends right when the anime's about to rejoin.

69
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,420
Or the anime and manga rejoin too early, and the anime has to diverge again in no time.

70
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,120
Or in the process of diverging,

71
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,140
the characters or setting in the anime become so different,

72
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,260
that they can never rejoin again.

73
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,860
Well, that's when they shamelessly remake the anime from the beginning again.

74
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,410
Or they use the same characters to make a totally different anime.

75
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,680
But Gin Tama doesn't have that big of a storyline.

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,890
Wouldn't it be hard to make an alternative route?

77
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,240
Yeah, what kind of alternative route is Gin Tama going to use?

78
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
That would be...

79
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,720
That would be?

80
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,220
That would be...

81
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,330
We bought ourselves four minutes today.

82
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,720
We won't let you go to the control room!

83
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,700
Damn! One hand short!

84
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,410
Good job, Shinpachi!

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,540
Hurry!

86
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,770
I'm sure it's right up ahead!

87
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,810
["The Color for Each Person's Bond Comes in Various Colors"]

88
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,310
Go!!

89
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,250
Don't give him time to fight back.

90
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,180
Don't let him breathe.

91
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,350
There won't be another chance...

92
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,100
If I don't finish him here, I'll lose.

93
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,050
It ends here!

94
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,180
This is...

95
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,180
The end!

96
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,500
B-Bastard...

97
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,360
You...bastard!!

98
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,560
Is this it?!

99
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,710
Seita-kun!

100
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,010
Hurry!

101
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,600
[Unlock]

102
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,840
I can also...

103
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,000
We must fight.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,440
We must fight from inside the cage.

105
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,910
If we don't smash through this cage, we'll never obtain true freedom.

106
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,220
Let me fight to the end, Seita.

107
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,060
Fight!!

108
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,560
Fire!

109
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,790
We finally...did it!

110
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,580
We defeated Hosen... We finally defeated the King of the Night! We're free!

111
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,390
Now Yoshiwara is... We are...free!

112
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,970
Not yet!

113
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,390
G-Gintoki!

114
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,390
Weak! Weak!!

115
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,700
You can assemble as many faint rays of light as you want.

116
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,890
You still won't be able to dry out the King of the Night!

117
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,140
You cannot light up this dark night!

118
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,840
I-Impossible!

119
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,390
After all that, he's still...?!

120
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,530
You're nothing like the sun.

121
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,350
A frail light, like a candle that can be extinguished with a mere blow.

122
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,330
That's what you all are!

123
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:14,680
You should have stayed chained to me with eyes of despair.

124
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,510
Though I never expected that you are flames to reignite...

125
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,680
from the remains of a fire once extinguished by us.

126
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,290
I must destroy the source of the fire, that...

127
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,220
...dim light of yours!

128
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,140
Hold it.

129
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,990
That's enough.

130
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,220
My life is enough.

131
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,420
Save that flare of yours,

132
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,230
for your cigarettes tomorrow.

133
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,330
Is that your so-called "Bushido"?

134
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,440
How honorable of you.

135
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,970
Offering your own life in exchange for forgiving those women?

136
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,290
A futile effort.

137
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,010
Once I'm finished with you, the women are next.

138
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,740
They won't be extinguished, none of them will.

139
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,150
Even if they're frail candles, if you gather enough, it can still illuminate the darkness.

140
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:24,560
Even if some are extinguished, as long as one remains lit, the rest can be re-lit.

141
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,680
You can't blow out my flame.

142
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,920
It's useless, no matter how hard you blow.

143
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,510
I have a special lighter with me.

144
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,540
I've got a lighter that can never be extinguished.

145
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,800
As long as I have them,

146
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,510
I'll burst back into flames every time you blow them out.

147
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,440
Wh...What?!

148
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,280
This...!

149
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,550
This light is...!!

150
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,320
Someone like you can never blow out our flame!

151
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,060
What's with this shaking?!

152
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,340
Look!

153
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,100
Someone like you...

154
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,600
can never blow out our flame!

155
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,650
Someone like you...

156
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,390
can never extinguish this light!

157
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,340
Th-This is...

158
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,710
This light is...!

159
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,240
It can't be...?!

160
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,220
Th-The sun!!

161
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,340
My blood is...

162
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,710
My flesh is...

163
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,390
My soul is drying up!

164
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,610
Go!

165
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,140
Gin-san!!

166
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,140
Burn off the chains...

167
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,810
of the King of the Night!!

168
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,660
Hey, Mister.

169
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,890
Why are you using an umbrella when it's so sunny?

170
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,020
Why?

171
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,200
Hey!

172
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,500
How dare you speak to Lord Hosen like that?!

173
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,510
I am terribly sorry, Lord Hosen.

174
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,240
She's just a country girl who knows nothing.

175
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
Please forgive her.

176
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,350
Come on, let's go.

177
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,090
Poor thing.

178
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,670
You can't even look at such a beautiful sky.

179
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,880
Hey, Mister.

180
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,190
Why do you live underground?

181
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,810
Do you hate the sun that much?

182
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,330
Or does the sun hate you?

183
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,200
What are you doing, you idiot?!

184
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,270
I'm so sorry, Lord Hosen.

185
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,560
Come on, let's go!

186
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,650
Mister, you shouldn't fight with the sun!

187
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,350
Stupid brat!

188
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,590
I see you're working hard.

189
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,350
L-Lord Hosen.

190
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,160
You're...

191
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,010
What did she do this time?

192
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,140
W-Well, she...

193
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,350
Show me what you're hiding behind your back.

194
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,740
I'm terribly sorry!

195
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,760
She insisted on giving this to you.

196
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,350
[For Mister]

197
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,370
Mister...

198
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,890
Bear with that for now, okay?

199
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,630
But I'm sure that one day,

200
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,140
I'll help you and the sun make up.

201
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,460
Fawning upon the man who took you from your family to sell you off.

202
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,560
If you can do that with your customers, you have a future here.

203
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,980
It doesn't matter who you are.

204
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,210
Mister, the sun shines above every person.

205
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,530
It gives light to everyone.

206
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,880
It shines above you, too...

207
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,290
I'm sure it'll warm your chilled heart.

208
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,850
So, Mister,

209
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,300
don't hate the sun.

210
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,030
My sworn enemy...

211
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,870
After all these years, you still haven't changed.

212
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,740
You still look down on the King of the Night from high above.

213
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,890
Indeed...  So aggravating...

214
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,470
Yet...

215
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,070
What a beautiful sight...

216
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,370
How pitiful people are.

217
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,660
They always yearn for what they don't have.

218
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,970
They always reach out to what can't be reached.

219
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,480
What does the King of the Night lack? That would be light.

220
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,420
Boss, you didn't dry up because of the sun.

221
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,140
You were thirsty for the sun.

222
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,050
As you shunned and hated it more than anyone else,

223
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,140
you envied and yearned for it more than anyone else.

224
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,640
To the sun we could never obtain...

225
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,600
Not to live on the cold battlefield,
but under a warm sun.

226
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,440
To the undying light within their eyes.

227
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,750
Hence, you dragged the women who had taken that light into your own night,

228
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,010
into this land of eternal night.

229
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:54,430
And when that light still wouldn't fade, you could only hate,

230
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,160
...and love.

231
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,490
Love?

232
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,910
Where did you learn such a word?

233
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:19,550
Kamui, you know more than anyone that I have no such emotion.

234
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,050
If you're walking down the same path as me.

235
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,300
Kamui, you are just like me.

236
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,680
A person who only knows how to fight.

237
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,260
You take everything you want by force.

238
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,220
You hold down everything you dislike by force.

239
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:49,310
You can only express love and hate through fighting.

240
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,590
Kamui, you will eventually learn.

241
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,680
When you're old and look back at the path you took,

242
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,450
you'll find that our path is empty.

243
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,650
Even when you find something you truly desire,

244
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,550
you lack the arms to hold it.

245
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,080
You can only sink your claws into it.

246
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:22,310
The more you try to bring it closer,
the deeper your claws sink in.

247
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,770
The more you reach out for them,
the further away they go.

248
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,890
Mister, the sun shines above every person.

249
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,380
It gives light to everyone.

250
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,100
Why must you hate me, as well?

251
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,360
It shines above you, too...

252
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,100
I'm sure it'll warm your chilled heart...

253
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,070
Why must you reject me, as well?

254
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,540
So, Mister,

255
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,060
don't hate the sun.

256
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,320
Why...  When I desire you so...

257
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,580
I am drying up...

258
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,630
I can see nothing at all...

259
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,830
A true night, where no light can reach...

260
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:56,590
So, even in death, the King of the Night must walk into the night...

261
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,810
This is...

262
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,980
This light is...

263
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,820

I've wanted to show you this for the longest time...

267

Show you this sky...
