[Breakfast should be a raw egg on hot rice. It tastes so good with a little soy sauce drizzled on top.]

[Today, "Tama-chan" appears. She was given that name by Kagura, who loves eggs.]

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,260
Trash... It is a single word, but there are many different types.

5
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,020
A woman with a cane came to throw away a single bag.

6
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,180
A smelly bag that oozed blood.

7
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,200
The trash collector thought it strange, but did not check its contents

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,080
and threw it into his truck.

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,100
The woman stared at him with eerie vacant eyes watching as he threw away the bag.

10
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,050
More than anything, the woman's bizarre appearance made him nervous.

11
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,350
It was summer, yet she wore heavy clothing that did not show any of her skin.

12
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,940
Her hands that were just barely exposed were tightly wrapped in bandages.

13
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,850
The following day, the woman came again, carrying a smelly bag.

14
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,640
And the next, and the day after that, the woman came with a bag,

15
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,610
dragging her body which grew weaker by the day; staring at the trash collector.

16
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,530
One day, the woman did not come.

17
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,070
but the usual smelly bag was on top of the trash pile.

18
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,800
The woman's stare was not here.

19
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,580
The trash collector peeked inside the bag.

20
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,320
The woman stared at him...just as she always had.

21
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,830
This isn't right. Today is recyclable trash day.

22
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,610
You're combustible trash!

23
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,740
I'm sorry...

24
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,270

[Let's sort our trash!]

26

If you don't, I might haunt you.

27
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,070
You call that a commercial? What bad taste!

28
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,580
They have to resort to such threats because no one follows the trash schedule.

29
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,500
Oh...

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,580
Tomorrow is non-combustible trash day...

31
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,600
I put out the JUMP...

32
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,990
No harm.

33
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,440
I might haunt you.

34
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,770
Don't be ridiculous. We're not kids here.

35
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,840
I can go and get it tomorrow.

36
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,310
Geez...

37
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,610
What do you want at this hour?

38
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,500
Nothing, it's just the trash...

39
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,010
I'm worried about it.

40
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,240
Why do I have to go with you? Staying up late is terrible for my complexion.

41
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,090
Don't you realize that?

42
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,570
Silly, you misunderstand. It's not that I'm scared or anything.

43
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,050
Just so you know, I threw away your favorite magazine with the JUMP.

44
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,230
Seriously? My Lady's Eight, with the evil daughter-in-law special article?

[Note: Spoof on the magazine "Jyosei Seven."]

46

Help me retrieve it.

47
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,490
No, something stinks.

48
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, you don't have to help me. Just stay by me.

49

No, something stinks.

50
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,330
Cut it out! Stop being so selfish!

51
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,870
I came to you because I was trying to help you!

52
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,110
Forget it! I get it! I won't ask you! Suit yourself!

53
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,180
Just stand quietly and watch!

54
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,410
Don't go anywhere. Just stay and watch me!

55
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,770
I don't want to. I'm sleepy, so I'm going home.

Just a minute!

158
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,470
With what you had?! The entire body was stolen from someplace else!

159
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,100
[Note: Spoof of Gundam.]

160
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,100
It'll withstand even a year-long war.

161
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,950
Why would a maid battle for a year! Why does a maid need a shield?!

162
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,820
She can hide behind the shield and see lots of things...like a family's problems.

163
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,450
She doesn't need to see those things! Leave those to Etsuko Ichihara!

164
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:38,070
[Spoof of "Kaseifu wa miteita" (Maid saw them all). Etsuko Ichihara plays a maid who sees scandals in the house she works in.]

165
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,070
I thought she'd be good for some cash.

166
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,180
I can't sell her unless you give her Bang! Pow! Boom! A nice buxom, hourglass body.

167
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,590
What do you mean, sell her?! Etsuko-chan will be my own personal, gentle maid!

168
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,200
Shut up, four-eyes! I'll send you to hell first!

169
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,210
She definitely needs a maid's outfit!

170
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,700
Attach an egg cracker! One that also takes out the slimy part!

171
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,890
I don't get it.

172
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,140
That's not right!

173
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,070
You wanna fight?

174
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,610
Never mind, just make her into your idea of a nice woman.

175
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,110
Bring it on!

176
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,610
Dirty specs!

177
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,120
You just made her bum bigger.

178
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,630
You didn't fix the parts that were basically wrong!

179
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,210
What is this thing you have for her bum?!

180
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,010
Women with big bums are good-they have easier deliveries.

181
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,690
That's old! So ancient! Your criteria for choosing a woman are so old!

182
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,200
What don't you like? I had a tough time with this part.

183
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,850
It pours soy sauce.

184
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,080
I don't care about your consideration for eggs on rice!

185
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,340
Why do you people like egg on rice so much?! Though I like it, too!

186
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,340
[Note: Japanese people often eat rice mixed with raw egg and a little soy sauce drizzled on top.]

187
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,770
You guys make a lot of demands.

188
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,700
If you want more done, you'll need to pay me more money.

189
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,720
Do you guys have the money?

190
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,220
[Strawberry Fields]

191
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,960
She's like an abandoned puppy.

192
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,620
Can't be helped. We don't have the money.

193
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,280
We can't sell her like this. I feel like a killer.

194
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,710
Not only can't we sell her, but without a body, we can't use her as a maid.

195
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,350
But according to Gengai-san, this robot ...

196
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,040
was specially designed for office tasks.

197
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,470
Her previous owner may have been using her more like a computer rather than as a maid.

198
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,780
Where's the on switch?

199
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,730
If it's her nipples, it's hopeless. We won't be able to boot her up.

200
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,810
Your head is what's hopeless.

201
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,310
Hey, wake up!

202
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,380
Ack!

203
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,150
Could it be this mole on her head?

204
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,360
She turned on?!

205
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,780
Unfortunately, your adventures 1, 2 and 3 have disappeared.

206
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,780
[Note: Spoof of saved file for Dragon Quest game.]

207
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,910
Hey, this isn't good. We hit her too hard-the adventures have disappeared.

208
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,260
What are the adventures?

209
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,720
She went adventuring somewhere, no doubt.

210
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,360
Please rebuild the adventures from the beginning. First: A name.

211
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,100
It's asking for a name.

212
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,550
It's a hassle, so just say, "Aaaa."

213
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,150
That won't do. You'll regret it later if you're lazy.

214
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,530
Where's the excitement if you say "Aaaa" when you're fighting the evil king.

215
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,860
What's an evil king? She intends to fight an evil king.

216
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,080
Okay, then "Tama."

217
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,080
[Note: Tama is short for tamago (egg).]

218
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,510
Roger.

219
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,930
Tama?! How far are you going with this egg thing?!

220
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,200
That sounds like a stray dog.

221
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,410
How do you do, everyone. My name is Marie Antoinette.

222
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,040
She ignored Tama! She didn't like it! She didn't like it!

223
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,290
Everyone calls me "Mole Beam."

224
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,260
She was teased! She was totally teased about the mole on her forehead!

225
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,890
Who's "everyone"?

226
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,950
[Note: Party member types from Dragon Quest game.]

227
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,950
Warriors and martial artists. They're physical, but very gloomy.

228
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,590
The memories make me blue. Shall I save the adventure?

229
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,840
She's trying to end the adventure on her own!

230
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,720
Wait! This adventure is just beginning!

231
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,680
Please write down the restart chant.

232
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,120
Mogagazuboroso, kusaremagurobaromi.

233
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,870
A password, in this day and age?!

234
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,610
Notepad! Hurry and get a notepad!

235
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,980
Putsun.

236
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,350
Ack!

237
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,800
She turned herself off!

238
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,190
What did she say her password was?

239
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,140
Kusarimaguro something or other...

240
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,730
Why is there no save function when the adventure turns off?

241
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,020
She's faking it. She just doesn't want to do any work.

242
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,080
Hey! Wake up, dummy!

243
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,090
Stop sleeping, you rotten tuna! You deserve to get shot 16 times, dummy!

244
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,820
Hey! She spat oil on her master!

245
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,980
Who do you think you are?!

246
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,530
Please do not touch the controller and power button during a save.

247
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,990
It may cause damage.

248
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,820
You don't have a save function!

249
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,610
I will repeat the restart chant.

250
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,940
Hey! It doesn't want to be restarted!

251
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,010
She's using some strange ancient characters!

252
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,290
Putsun.

253
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,650
Wait! Hey!

254
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,150
Cut that out, you!

255
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,210
She's totally busted.

256
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,160
You just need to blow into the cartridge.

257
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,740
The adventure never got far, so what we have to do is start from the beginning.

258
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,710
It'll be troublesome, but let's be patient.

259
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,560
Parararappappaa!

260
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,130
[Note: Level up sound from Dragon Quest game.]

261
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,130
Tama has gone up a level.

262
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,060
I don't know what's going on, but she's gone up a level!

263
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,280
Strength: up 3. Speed: up 2. Lassitude: up 5.

264
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,710
Lethargy: up 6. Exhaustion: up 7. I am feeling empty.

265
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,680
Just a minute! Our chances of losing are rising!

266
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,840
Lethargy rising 2...zuborokusaremagurobaromi...

267
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,480
She forced herself into the restart chant!

268
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,950
I feel weak. I don't want to move. It's difficult to work.

269
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,050
Along the way, it's become nothing but gripes!

270
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,230
Putsun.

271
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,860
This is hopeless. Doesn't look like she'll make us any money at all.

272
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,500
Announcer Ketsuno, are you there at the scene? Ketsuno? Ana?

273
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,370
Yes, this is Ketsuno...Ana, at the scene.

274
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,140
I'm reporting from in front of the Hayashi Research Institute, where the incident occurred.

275
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,650
It's Announcer Ketsuno. She's back.

276
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,980
Tsk, like a boomerang.

277
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,330
Huh?

278
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,220
The murdered victim, Dr. Ryuzan Hayashi, was known as an authority on automatons.

279
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,580
That's the lab that created Tama-san.

280
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,400
He was the developer of the robot maid, Etsuko-chan.

281
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,380
[Murdered: Dr. Ryuzan Hayashi]

282
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,610
That's...

283
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,480
Based on eyewitness reports, the Magistrate's Office is...

284
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,550
searching for Fuyo No. i-Zero, an automaton that worked as the doctor's assistant, on suspicion of murder.

285
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,450
At the present time, Fuyo No. i-Zero is a fugitive.

286
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,640
Eyewitnesses should contact the Magistrate's Office immediately. I repeat...

287
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,060
Could this be...?

288
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,720
Tama-san?!

289
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,720
There's no mistake! The robot that's suspected of murder...

290
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,370
is our Tama-san! Though she's only a head now.

291
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,480
And this Dr. Hayashi-he's the man who built Tama-san and the other robot maids!

292
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,640
She killed the parent who gave her life...and showed up here?

293
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,340
That can't be!

294
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,820
This piece of junk could never do something as mysterious as being involved in a murder case!

295
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,490
We're talking about a robot!

296
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,310
There are others that have the same face.

297
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,000
She's only a head-how could she commit murder?!

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,400
There is the possibility that I was destroyed by someone while on the run and became just a head.

299
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,100
Unfortunately, I have lost most of my memory of what happened before I became just a head.

300
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,820
However, I am the No. i-Zero model.

301
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,180
She restarted without the restart chant.

302
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,630
Forgive me after earlier. I had an initialization issue. I am now restored.

303
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,290
You talked a lot of chop-logic, but in essence,

304
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,200
what you're trying to say is, that you're the murderer?

305
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,010
No. I do not have any recollection, so I am simply stating my opinion based on the data.

306
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,490
I'm asking you: did you kill him, or did you not?

307
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,710
If you don't know, then check your data further.

308
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,700
You can't find it because you assumed at the start that it wasn't there.

309
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,500
It might be closer than you think.

310
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,350
Understood. Searching.

311
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,440
Tama has checked the data. Of all things, I have found horse shit.

312
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,440
[Note: Spoof of Dragon Quest game.]

313
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,090
[Note: GEO is a Japanese rental video/game store that also buys used games.]

314
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,920
Hey, you want to be sold off to GEO?

315
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,090
She's not fixed at all. Initialization issues? She's got the mother of all issues!

316
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,140
Forgive me. Is there a mechanical engineer in the vicinity?

317
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,130
Huh?

318
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,830
I possess a backup memory area in case of an emergency,

319
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,560
but it is tightly secured...

320
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,970
If it can be opened, my memory could be restored.

321
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm not sure I understand...

322
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,700
For now, we can bring her back to old man Gengai, uh-huh.

323
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,940
But...

324
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,610
What if she gets her memory back...and it turns out she's really the killer?

325
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,650
Don't assume that. We don't know that yet.

326
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,400
Excuse me.

327
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,740
We're from the Magistrate's Office.

328
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,140
Could we ask your help with an investigation?

329
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,250
We received word from the neighbors that there is a suspicious robot here.

330
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,450
Gin-san!

331
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,290
It's too soon! Too soon to assume!

332
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,280
Don't give me that!

333
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,100
At this rate, we'll be murder suspects, too! Let me go! Get rid of her now!

334
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,100
This apparatus carries a curse. You cannot discard it.

335
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,100
[Note: Parody of Dragon Quest game.]

336
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,540
Don't tell me I can't discard it! I never recalled getting you in the first place!

337
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,340
To remove this apparatus,

338
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,450
either go to your nearest church or withdraw 3 million yen from an ATM and deposit it to my account.

339
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,300
What kind of way is that to lift a curse?!

340
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,400
Excuse me.

341
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,570
If we keep this up, they'll become suspicious of us!

342
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,970
I'll deal with them, while you hide her!

343
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,200
Please wait.

344
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,920
I do not detect life signs...

345
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,740
in two of the three visitors. They are not officials.

346
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,710
They are not even human.

347
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,310
There's no one here.

348
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,860
Are they on to us?

349
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,210
Hey! Who were those people?! The house is ruined!

350
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,610
How many times is our foyer going to be destroyed?!

351
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,960
Hey, what's the big idea? Let go of my arm already.

352
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,340
They came after you. Are you going to get us involved, too? Hey, answer me.

353
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,840
I have no answer... I am like a mere corpse...

354
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,840
[Note: The response given when speaking to a corpse in Dragon Quest game.]

355
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,870
Zaoriku.

356
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,870
[Note: Name of a powerful revival spell in Dragon Quest game.]

357
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,110
Ow, ow, ow! I'm restored. I'm restored.

358
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,500
I'm telling you to let go. You'd curse the hand that repaired you?

359
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,670
I cannot do anything as just a head.

360
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,260
Please at least take me to a mechanic.

361
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,950
And, I think you'd best concentrate on making your escape.

362
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,810
But you won't reach a higher level if all you do is run.

363
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:42,130
Don't forget to arm yourself. Simply holding me does not mean you're armed.

364
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,140
Let go! Apparatus!

365
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,240
Gin-chan!

366
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,170
There!

367
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,840
What the hell is that? That maid... What power!

368
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,180
Found you! Mole Beam!

369
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,630
Time to clean house!

370
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,350
Whoa! I can see her panties! Your panties!

371
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,720
Wh-Wha-What?! Monster!

372
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,360
Fuyo No. 2-305.

373
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,190
The newest model robot maid developed by the Fuyo Project.

374
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,190
[Note: "Fuyo" written differently, but pronounced identically, can mean "unnecessary" or "useless."]

375
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,510
That's no maid! That's a weapon! A weapon!

376
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,720
A.K.A. Kurin-chan. She's specially designed for cleaning.

377
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,890
She's fastidious to the point of paranoia

378
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,180
and is a defective model returned by consumers for being troublesome.

379
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,110
You don't have your memory, so why is it you remember things about her?

380
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,410
She currently works at the laboratory as part of the janitorial staff.

381
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,100
She is an idiot who has tried many times

382
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,620
to remove the mole on my forehead because she mistakes it for rubbish.

383
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,260
She's Mole Beam's bully!

384
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,190
She's the girl who teased Tama-san by calling her Mole Beam!

385
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,400
What...

386
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,550
...ever!

387
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,590
Throwing out the trash is not the only job of the janitorial staff.

388
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,380
My, what a filthy truck.

389
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,980
In other words,

390
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,560
they eliminate anything that gets in the way of the Fuyo Project, leaving not even a speck of dust behind.

391
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,940
They are steel-cold assassins.

392
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,390
What? You mean...

393
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,710
Tama-san, you're being targeted by your friends...from the laboratory?

394
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,490
Why... Are you and the Doctor in...

395
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,550
'Pachi-san, now's not the time for that.

396
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,170
You do realize...

397
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,860
at this rate, we'll be...

398
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,010
sent to hell by...

399
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,500
those maids.

400
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,150
M-Maids...

401
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,700
What a spectacular sight.

402
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,900
A sight that'd make any fetishist cry tears of joy.

403
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,460
You don't have to be a fetishist to cry...

404
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,040
What'll we do?

405
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,680
Hand over Mole Beam to us. We will dispose of her.

406
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,280
Hand her over without a struggle!

407
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,820
We will not harm you. This does not concern you.

408
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,210
How can you say that when you've already gotten so many people involved!

409
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,530
We don't believe you, dummies!

410
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,390
If we hand her over, you'll attack us all at once!

411
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,010
You're in danger. Never mind me. Do as they say.

412
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,660
Let go of me.

413
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,110
You let go!

414
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,330
Mole Beam. Where did you put it?

415
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,630
We know you stole it from Dr. Hayashi.

416
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,950
What're you talking about? Horse shit?

417
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,160
You know that's not it!

418
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,930
You can't play dumb. You killed Dr. Hayashi to obtain it.

419
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,560
The Fuyo Project will only achieve success when we have it.

420
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,470
It is meaningless for an old model like you to have it.

421
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,320
He will make it happen.

422
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,070
And then robots will become equal to gods.

423
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,720
What're you...!

424
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,400
Oh... I want to become a robot.

425
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,590
Doctor, why do you say such a thing?

426
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,040
Why are you suffering so?

427
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,290
Why are you so sad?

428
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,010
I don't understand. I don't...understand.

429
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,300
[I'm only a robot-I don't understand.]

430
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,780
I'm only a robot-I don't understand.

431
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,240
You're...

432
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,570
A robot shedding tears...how is that possible?!

433
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,270
You did have it, after all.

434
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,780
A robot could never shed those droplets.

435
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,180
It's proof without a doubt.

436
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,680
Hand it over! To us!

437
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,780
Stop...

438
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,220
interfering!

439
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,820
Gin-san!

440
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Shinpachi! Jump!

441
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,100
Shinpachi!

442
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,640
Take her to old man Gengai's place! Hurry!

443
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,520
But...!

444
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,240
I'll join you later!

445
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,400
Get going!

446
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,120
