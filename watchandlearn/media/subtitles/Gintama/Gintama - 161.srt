2
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,880
The first match of this three-match contest, the quiz showdown,

3
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,450
goes to the Tsusengumi!

4
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,080
Mr. Kondo, of the Tsusengumi, in realizing that Otsu-chan physically can't stand him

5
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,170
has successfully propelled his losing team to a win!

6
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,020
You did it, Chief.

7
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,920
Did what?

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,470
You've taken all the glory.

9
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,800
Good effort.

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,300
Huh? What glory?

11
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,210
On the flip side,

12
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,360
the Fan Club was on the verge of victory before it slipped through their fingers!

13
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,750
Hey, freak!

14
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,480
Why do you think I bought that expensive French bread to hire you, damn it?!

15
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,200
It doesn't matter how well you did if we didn't win.

16
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,450
You can't sell a crappy song that's never hit number one in this country.

17
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,530
They're fighting amongst each other!

18
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,630
The members who didn't do a thing are blaming Mr. Taka-tin!

19
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,240
Yet he looks so calm.

20
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,910
I don't really get it, but we somehow made it through the first match.

21
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,540
We just have to keep this up and take the second match. Then victory will be ours.

22
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,830
Damn it...

23
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,140
We could have won if I had been up there...

24
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,670
We definitely won't lose the next one.

25
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,470
We can't let it end like this!

26

["Laputa's Still Good After Seeing It So Many Times"]

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,820
Now we'll move on to the next showdown!

28
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,230
The second match in this three-match contest!

29
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,480
A charisma showdown!

30
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,480
[Match 2 - Charisma Showdown]

31
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,860
After testing your stamina and wits, we will now test your charisma!

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,910
Both teams will now take turns

33
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,850
hitting on Otsu-chan!

34
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,320
The team who manages to successfully woo Otsu-chan

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,190
and take her to someplace with nice and quiet accommodations will win!

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:18,950
[Note: Metaphor for a love hotel - a type of short-stay hotel operated primarily for the purpose of allowing couples privacy for having sex.]

37
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,340
What are you implying by "nice and quiet accommodations"?!

38
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,760
What the hell?!

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,070
How can you do this to an idol?!

40
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,950
Please calm down, everybody!

41
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,590
This will merely be a simulation.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,030
Nobody will actually be taking her anywhere.

43
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,600
Everything that's about to happen will be purely a simulation!

44
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,490
Come up with your own setting,

45
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,300
lines, and a whole package that will really touch Otsu-chan.

46
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,620
And hit on Otsu-chan in this improvised virtual space!

47
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,610
You could say that this is an acting contest!

48
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,000
One person will be assigned to putting on the moves,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,190
while two others assist.

50
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,370
The last person will narrate the entire scene!

51
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,980
You'll be given three minutes to prepare!

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,830
Three minutes?

53
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,420
That's it?

54
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,060
This contest also tests your ability to ad lib!

55
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,990
Or else, we won't be able to see your true charm!

56
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,000
The winner of the last match, the Tsusengumi, will go first!

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,430
To be fair, the latter team, the Fan Club, won't be allowed to confer after the clock starts.

58
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,280
Just decide on a basic setting and flow.

59
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,350
Then start brainstorming!

60
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,430
Hey, what do we do, Toshi?

61
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,900
I'm guessing that you're the one hitting on her.

62
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,400
Wait, why me?

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
As the most popular man in the Shinsengumi,

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,870
you should be well-versed in the female heart.

65
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,890
I'm not, man.

66
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,340
Give me a break.

67
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,380
It'd be embarrassing to hit on a girl in front of all these people.

68
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,280
Just go with Yamazaki or something.

69
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
How am I supposed to hit on a girl with this hair?

70
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,330
[Fist of the North Star is a famous manga and anime series.]

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,330
I can't play anything beyond a side role in Fist of the North Star.

72
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,150
Besides, we came here for your sake.

73
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,880
You need to do this yourself.

74
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,920
I don't want to embarrass myself so I'll just narrate behind the scenes.

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,010
Hey, wait!

76
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,860
Why are you deciding this on your own?

77
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,210
I'll just make something up so play along, everybody.

78
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,460
Okay!

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,620
H-H-Hey, wait!

80
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,470
Time's up! That's all!

81
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,750
Hey! I said to wait up! For real!

82
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,700
Let the Tsusengumi's romantic play begin!

83
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,980
[The scene you are about to watch is just a simulation.]

84
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,740
The setting is a bar on the top floor of a fancy hotel with a wonderful night view.

85
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,210
As women cheerfully pour drinks for the rich patrons,

86
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,410
a man is bitterly drinking his liquor alone again tonight.

87
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,940
A bar, huh...

88
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,670
Not bad for Sogo...

89
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,070
I guess I have no choice.

90
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,350
Well, it'll probably work out somehow.

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,110
This was the man's special seat on Friday nights.

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,050
He would always arrive with no purpose and sit drinking until the place closed.

93
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,760
As he did the Friday before,

94
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,830
and the Friday before that,

95
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,910
and the Friday before that,

96
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,220
and the Friday before that.

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,250
Hey, isn't your narration a little long?

98
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,830
But the Friday before that was a little different.

99
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,720
Because they were playing Laputa on Friday Roadshow.

100
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:04,170
[Note: Reference to Laputa: Castle in the Sky. Friday Roadshow is a movie program on Nippon TV.]

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
Who cares about that?

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,170
Just move on already.

103
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,310
He set up his TiVo before heading to the bar,

104
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,920
but then he remembered the hard drive was already full,

105
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,460
so he returned to clear up some space,

106
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,910
and accidentally deleted Terminator 3 which he hadn't watched yet.

107
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,230
Once Laputa came up on the screen,

108
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,300
Forget that already!

109
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,980
Nobody cares about the details!

110
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,690
Just move on already!

111
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,640
the man became all excited as though summer vacation had just begun.

112
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,150
Hey!

113
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,840
I told you to drop the Laputa already!

114
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,300
Where are you going with this?!

115
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,260
He's already seen it many times,

116
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,150
but he always felt sad as he watched Laputa rise in the ending.

117
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,410
As he did the time before...

118
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,480
Move on already!

119
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,870
And the time before that...

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:48,600
[Note: Porco Rosso is a Hayao Miyazaki film about a cursed Italian World War I fighter ace who is transformed into a pig.]

121
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,460
And I'm more of a Porco Rosso fan!

122
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,600
In fact, the man went to this bar in a towering hotel

123
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,710
because he had a faint hope that he might be able to see Laputa from here.

124
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,970
That was the reason?!

125
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,220
Shouldn't there be some kind of a better reason?

126
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,850
But he still couldn't see Laputa tonight...

127
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,480
The man had a bitter look on his face.

128
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,790
That's way too bitter!

129
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,120
What kind of character am I?!

130
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,130
Forget it.

131
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,830
Stop digging into my character.

132
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,090
Just bring out Otsu.

133
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,320
Hey, big guy.

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,870
You're alone again tonight?

135
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,250
Honestly...

136
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,960
There's something wrong with all the women in this world who ignore such a lady-killer.

137
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,680
He was the only person Laputa ever opened up to, the master.

138
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,650
Why is Laputa my nickname?

139
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,880
A cheerful man who didn't discriminate against a soul.

140
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:37,750
[Note: Reference to: My Neighbor Totoro, another Miyazaki film.]

141
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,610
By the way, his favorite movie was Totoro.

142
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,730
Cut it out already!

143
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,750
Do you have to use Ghibli films to exemplify everybody's character?!

144
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,620
He wasn't a pedo,

145
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,400
[Note: Satsuki and Mei are the two young girl main characters from My Neighbor Totoro.]

146
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,400
but if he had to choose between Satsuki and Mei, he'd go with Satsuki.

147
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,170
Who cares about the master?!

148
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,510
And why does he look so smug?!

149
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,400
But few people knew that he'd been turned off

150
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,840
by how realistic the crying was in the scene where

151
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,940
Satsuki learns that her mother won't be released from the hospital.

152
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,160
How would anybody know about something so meaningless?!

153
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,290
However, few people knew that he wasn't actually the master,

154
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,410
but merely a part-timer who was nicknamed, "the master".

155
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,800
Nobody wants to know that useless information!

156
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,610
That's enough narrating already!

157
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,900
Long ago, after watching him using the shaker,

158
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,690
the other employees had an argument about whether to call him "the master" or "bation".

159
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,460
You meant that master?!

160
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,500
What kind of nickname is that?!

161
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,190
He's just being bullied!

162
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,880
It's hopeless.

163
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,410
This won't go anywhere if I leave it to them.

164
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,660
I have to do something...

165
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,170
Master, I've grown tired of drinking by myself.

166
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,410
Could you introduce me to a nice lady?

167
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,130
Surely, you jest.

168
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,290
If such a nice lady were around, I'd have taken her already.

169
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,030
Sorry about that.

170
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,700
You're in the same bind.

171
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,220
If only a cute girl would fall out of the sky.

172
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,090
Now that I've said that, they'll have to bring her out...

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,470
Such a funny man...

174
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,910
Are you Ghibler?

175
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,770
[Note: A term for Studio Ghibli fan]

176
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,770
Here she is.

177
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,870
Is the cute girl falling out of the sky Sheeta from Laputa?

178
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,590
Or Kiki from Kiki's Delivery Service?

179
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,140
Or the whore who's fallen out of grace,

180
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,980
moi?

181
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,330
I didn't mean you!

182
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,720
May I join you?

183
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
Hell no! Who are you supposed to be?!

184
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,990
Can't you bring out Otsu already?!

185
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,320
Why bring out the stupid mohawk now?!

186
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,620
Get a clue!

187
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,940
And there aren't any women with hair like this!

188
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,090
He's making a huge impression!

189
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,390
Sorry to keep you waiting.

190
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,330
My work kept me late.

191
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,040
Ah, over here.

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,510
Sh-She's here!

193
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,350
I see.

194
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,990
The strategy is for him to play Otsu's friend and introduce the two of us,

195
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,470
so he can provide assistance for a smooth attack.

196
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,380
Nice thinking.

197
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,070
So he wasn't just playing a female for no reason at all.

198
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,820
Why are you in the middle?!

199
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,970
Um, is that man a friend of yours, Mohi-chan?

200
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,040
[Note: Short for "mohawk" which is pronounced "Mohikan" in Japanese.]

201
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,040
Ah, yes.

202
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,610
He just hit on me, so I was going to have a little fun with him.

203
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,610
Do you want me to kill you, stupid mohawk?!

204
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,410
I don't have time to mess with you!

205
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,930
Why is a sideshow taking the best position!

206
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,450
That's where I'm supposed to be sitting!

207
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,600
Uh, would you like-

208
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,450
A drink?

209
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,930
Get a clue!

210
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,070
Move out of the way, mohawk!

211
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,150
I can't get in a word edgewise!

212
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,040
Excuse me.

213
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,390
Could I get oolong tea?

214
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,560
This man and I were just having

215
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,080
a heated discussion about which Ghibli heroine was the best.

216
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,170
We weren't.

217
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,850
You're still going on about Ghibli?!

218
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,950
Who's your favorite, Otsu?

219
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,470
Who cares about that subject?!

220
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,700
You could at least ask what her type is!

221
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,070
I'd have to go with Satsuki.

222
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,340
Nobody was talking to you!

223
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,720
The way she looks after her little sister reminds me of Otae-san.

224
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,180
She'll definitely make a wonderful mother!

225
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,400
Don't mention Otae-san.

226
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,960
You're not even acting anymore.

227
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,260
I don't have a particular favorite,

228
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,110
but if I had to choose, I'd go with Kiki.

229
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,010
Why is the narrator participating in the conversation?!

230
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,480
It's actually easier to break in girls who have a lot of pride.

231
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,820
Once you've broken their self-respect,

232
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,920
they're weaker than most people on the inside.

233
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,740
What the hell are you saying?!

234
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,010
The ones with a hard shell fall even harder.

235
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,900
Don't defile Ghibli!

236
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,530
It's true that Satsuki would make a great mom,

237
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,350
but she's not much of a woman.

238
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,500
She doesn't even try to be fashion-conscious.

239
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,420
A person with a mohawk shouldn't be talking.

240
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,430
She's the type with natural beauty who forgets about dressing herself up.

241
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,860
Or if she were to try, she'd find that

242
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,810
[Note: Reference to Japanese model, pop singer "Kaela Kimura".]

243
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,810
there wasn't anything to fix, so she'd try for a different angle and go overboard like Kaela.

244
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,870
How far are you reading into this?!

245
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,760
You people are creeping me out!

246
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,760
I'd say that Mei-chan would be the type to be completely different at a reunion.

247
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,940
She's got a complex about her sister and she's the kind who grows with effort.

248
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,070
But she can only grow so much!

249
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,440
Since, she takes after her father!

250
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,430
That'll be her peak, so she can't beat her older sister!

251
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,800
Yeah, but girls who are cute when they're little

252
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,640
are already at their peak, so they can only deteriorate.

253
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,370
Talk about this back at headquarters!

254
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,550
You're the only ones getting into this conversation!

255
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,870
Do you people really love Ghibli that much?!

256
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,280
You have no intention of supporting me.

257
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,790
Otsu is being left in the dust.

258
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Th-This is...

259
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,510
An odd sense of solidarity.

260
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,350
Both feeling lonely, like the outsiders of a group...

261
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,850
Are we starting to feel like kindred spirits?

262
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,820
Like two people who've come to the city from the country and feel left out at a party.

263
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,370
Everybody's so excited.

264
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,570
Aren't you going to go party with everyone else?

265
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,980
I'm not very good with these situations.

266
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,570
Ah, I'm actually the same way.

267
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,590
This is how they usually hit it off!

268
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,330
Could it be that you guys...

269
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,530
Now!

270
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,330
Now is your chance, Vice-Chief!

271
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,620
Go, Toshi!

272
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,000
Isn't she a nice girl?

273
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,210
Invite her along.

274
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,080
[Note: The image is similar to the character Dola from Laputa: Castle In the Sky.]

275
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,080
The storm ceases and the clouds part.

276
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:14,480
[Hotel in the Sky]

277
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,760
Laputa really existed!

278
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,370
The End!

279
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,720
The Tsusengumi managed to check in!

280
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,700
They've easily landed Otsu-chan without using romantic words or presents!

281
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,660
A clever psychological plan which displayed amazing teamwork!

282
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,270
I must say I am impressed!

283
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,500
Th-That's impossible!

284
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,170
How do you feel right now, Otsu-chan?

285
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,320
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,980
I was just going with the flow and ended up tagging along.

287
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,110
So you're the type of girl who'll end up in a place like that by going with the flow, slut.

288
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,810
MC, shut the fuck up!

289
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,410
Otsu-chan's no slut!

290
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,480
She's just a ditz!

291
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,350
Say it again and I'll murder you!

292
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,660
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club is up next and is now in a difficult position!

293
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,320
Even if they manage to land Otsu-chan, the match will be up to the judges!

294
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,310
They have no chance of victory if they don't use a brilliant method!

295
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,390
Don't worry, Shinpachi.

296
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,910
Couples that are formed through collusion don't last long.

297
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,750
But Gin-san, we were busy trying to translate for Taka-tin

298
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,850
during preparation and barely decided on anything.

299
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,960
What do we do?

300
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,760
This match rides on the narration, which determines the whole situation.

301
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,870
Well, you can't go wrong by leaving it to me.

302
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,240
We can really trust you, right?

303
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,440
Please give us a really romantic one.

304
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Yeah, yeah.

305
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,060
I'll give you some romantic-shmantic stuff.

306
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,490
So the Tsu Terakado Fan Club's romantic play begins now!

307

[The scene you are about to watch is just a simulation.]

Once upon a time, a long time ago,

309
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,420
when demons and gods still existed...

310
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,340
Huh?

311
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,650
The battle between gods and demons brought ruin to the earth,

312
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:12,240
leading to a dark age where humans lived underground in fear.

313

Wait... Gin-san?

314
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:20,880
However, in this barren land where malevolent gods and sinister demons ran rampant,

315
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
Uh, what is this?

316
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,220
a solitary shadow moved towards the west.

317
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,940
Gin-san, you know what the goal is right?

318
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,280
A romantic situation where you can hit on a girl.

319
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:38,240
They headed to a destination far to the west, bearing the hopes of humanity.

Hey, narrator.

372
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,150

374

You should apologize, chief priest.

385

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,660

407
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,390
Isn't he the demon?!

408
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,030
This is delicious!

409
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,600
I haven't had anything to eat in forever!

410
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,250
Oh, shit! It's my bread!

411
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,280
You're all so greedy!

412
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,580
I'm not feeling lonely at all...

413
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,860
I'm fine being alone.

414
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,330
Afterwards, we continued on our journey to save the world,

415
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,300
but I refused to stay in any Gandara Vehotel.

416
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,310
I grew accustomed to camping outside.

417
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,670
It was scary in the beginning,

418
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,020
but I must have been lucky as I was never attacked by demons in my sleep.

419
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,270
But, whenever I woke up,

420
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,820
I would see demon footprints in the sand around me.

421
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,790
Were they afraid of me?

422
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,820
Or were they after me?

423
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:50,530
I wasn't entirely sure, but oddly enough, I wasn't scared of the footprints.

424
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:58,510
I was more focused on how envious I was of the merry sounds coming from the Vehotel.

425
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,360
How could they leave me alone to have so much fun?

426
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,510
Why won't anyone come invite me?

427
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,100
Although I was the one who turned them down,

428
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,940
I continued to think such selfish thoughts as I camped outside.

429
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,100
And then one night,

430
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,280
I was woken up by a strange sensation.

431
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,910
I had been surrounded by demons.

432
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,960
Yes...

433
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,170
I finally saw the demons the footprints belonged to...

434
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,390
The demons weren't afraid of me or after me...

435
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,890
They were protecting me...

436
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,240
I told them to leave you alone, but they wouldn't listen.

437
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,490
They're fools.

438
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,310
Do you think people who do this would be capable of dirty acts?

439
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,730
Why would those who protect your sleeping face want to defile it?

440
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,790
If you still feel that way, keep on camping outside.

441
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,490
Thanks to you, I get to enjoy the Vehotel all by myself.

442
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,670
That was when I saw...

443
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,830
There was sand on Narry's butt.

444
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,160
The next day,

445
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,500
a new voice could be heard among the merry voices

446
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,530
in the Gandara Vehotel.

447
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:44,290
That laughing voice was higher than the others and echoed through the desert.

448
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,440
The end!

449
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,760
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club managed to check in!

450
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,050
Why do I feel so refreshed after they succeeded in checking in?

451
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,730
Refreshed?! Wasn't there something obviously wrong?!

452
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,990
Otsu-chan became the narrator halfway through!

453
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,860
There's clear evidence that Otsu-chan was in on the planning!

454
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,590
Otsu-chan!

455
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,660
Between the Tsusengumi and the Fan Club, who wins?!

456
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,600
Why am I being ignored?!

457
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,430
Let's see...

458
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,680
Both sides performed wonderfully.

459
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,440
The characters stood out and the setting was fleshed out.

460

The Tsu Terakado Fan Club wins!

461
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,390
Now both teams are at one win and one loss!

462
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,770
Hey! That was like judging a manga!

463
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,460
What about the charisma?!

464
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,890
Wasn't this a charisma showdown?!

465
