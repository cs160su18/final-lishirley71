All the people in Edo

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,420
Katsura: Elizabeth, I need you to run an errand.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,170
An errand?

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,140
Katsura: There's a sale on shampoo at the Oedo Mart.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,180
Why me?

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,180
Katsura: I'm a wanted member of the Anti-Foreigner Faction, though I may not look the part.

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,190
Katsura: I can't go shopping at a supermarket in broad daylight...

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,700
You can keep the change.

Katsura: Elizabeth isn't back yet...

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,600
Where's the Oedo Store again?

22
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,350
Where is the Oedo Store?

23
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,230
Michael: I can't read Japanese.

24
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,490
I'm trying to get to the Oedo Store.

25
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,950
Old Man: My eyes aren't too good.

26
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,710
Where is the Oedo Store located??

27
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,710
Pedro: How about you listen to my story instead?

28
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,690
Pedro: This weird kid showed up at my place again last night.

29
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,090
Pedro: They ring my doorbell and say...

30
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,220
20 minutes later

31
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Pedro: So yeah, this story doesn't really have a punch line or anything.

32
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,190
Where is the Oedo Store located?

33
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,190
Pedro: Huh? Oedo Store?

34
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,480
Pedro: Never heard of it.

35
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,790
Kagura: Elizabeth, what's up?

36
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,000
Big Sale

is gone.

39
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,300
What do I do?

40
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,020
What do I do?!

41
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,800
Excuse me.

42
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,120
[Note: Voice by supervisor, Shinji Takamatsu.]

43
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,120
Where's the Oedo Store?

44
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,360
Kagura: Over there.

45
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,370
Katsura: Oh!! What a relief, Elizabeth.

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,380
Katsura: This is...

47
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,880
conditioner.

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,340
Katsura: Unbelievable!! This is unbelievable!!

49
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,350
Katsura: I expected you to be a little more useful.

50
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,690
Katsura: What are you going to do if my long hair becomes all dry?!

51
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,190
Katsura: I don't want to end up with dandruff. I'll have a hard time leading my men if my head's covered with flakes.

52
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,570
Katsura: Everyone will be staring at the dandruff instead of listening to what I say. Ahh, I expected you to be a little more useful. A preschooler could run this errand for me. I saw it on TV the other day, and I almost cried. But no, look at you.

53
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,540
Whoohoo!

[The Whinery]

57
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,050
Welcome!

58
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,270
Man, it's freezing today, old man.

59
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,940
It sure is.

60
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,730
It might snow soon.

61
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,570
They keep talking about global warming,

62
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,530
but Earth's only getting warmer on the outside.

63
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,390
Here in Edo, the town and the people's hearts are just getting chillier.

64
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,650
Got that right.

65
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,570
When will I get some warm action going on?

66
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:47,180
[Note: "Warm action" refers to getting some more money in his wallet.]

67
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,180
Warm yourself up with some of this, big guy.

68
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,760
Sorry, but I'm looking for something sweeter.

69
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,050
Sweeter?

70
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,830
Sorry, but could you mix a little coffee milk or strawberry milk in there?

71
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,610
Can you fix one up?

72
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,880
Absolutely, but you have unique tastes, big guy.

73
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,160
You know what they say.

74
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,830
Something sweet helps when you're exhausted.

75
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,090
That's right, big guy. You look awfully tired.

76
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,150
And your hair's all white.

77
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,700
Did something happen?

78
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,970
I was born this way.

79
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,420
If you've got something on your mind, why not let it out here?

80
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,380
Huh?

81
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,910
Men are vain creatures.

82
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,440
They never complain, whether at work or at home.

83
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,890
Some things can only be told to a stranger.

84
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,180
Men need a place like this.

85
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,850
There really isn't anything on my mind...

86
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,170
Besides, the audience is watching.

87
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:48,350
Don't worry. This place protects the privacy of its customers.

88
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,020
Like how they can't even see your face.

89
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,490
Ah, I see.

90
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,480
Yeah.

91
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,940
It'll be like this the entire episode, so nobody will know who you are.

92
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,630
Feel free to say anything.

93
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,520
Ah, I see.

94
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,830
By the way, the practice here

95
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,590
is to pretend you don't recognize each other if you're acquaintances.

96
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,220
First: Complain all you want.

97
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,230
Second: Come alone.

98
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,210
Third: Pretend you don't recognize each other if you're acquaintances.

99
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,460
Fourth: Forget everything you hear in this place and do not tell a soul.

100
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,220
A place where you can feel free to complain.

101
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,660
That's what this stall is for.

102
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,350
Come on, big guy. Don't think too much and just spill your guts today.

103
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,750
Brush off all the dirt from this sad world so you can feel refreshed tomorrow, yeah?

104
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,520
Okay, coffee milk with shochu.

105
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,750
Complain, you say?

106
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,160
Actually, I'm complaining all the time, so I don't really have anything...

107
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,380
'Sup.

108
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,810
Hey, welcome!

109
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,050
Ah, sorry, big guy.

110
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,960
Could you slide over a bit?

111
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,400
Give this handsome samurai a seat.

112
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,490
Ah, sorry.

113
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,410
Not at all. Go ahead.

114
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,620
Whew, I can finally warm myself up.

115
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,240
It's freezing out there.

116
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,180
Came out of nowhere, really.

117
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,740
It wasn't this bad yesterday.

118
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,320
Indeed.

119
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,960
We're pretty much guaranteed to have snow...

120
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,360
Eh? Why did the two of you suddenly stop talking?

121
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,560
Don't tell me...

122
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,310
Ah, no. It's nothing.

123
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,940
Hey, pops.

124
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,630
Give me hot sake.

125
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,570
And a fish cake, a tofu fritter, and an egg.

126
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,570
[Note: Fish cakes and tofu fritters are popular items in an Oden hotpot.]

127
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,510
Gotcha.

128
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,750
And the usual...

129
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,230
Gotcha. Mayonnaise, right?

130
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,410
Uh, do you come here often?

131
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,200
Huh?

132
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,280
Well, you just asked for the usual...

133
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,140
Do you have a lot of complaining to do?

134
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,740
Nah, only once in a while.

135
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,920
Only been here two or three times, yeah.

136
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,200
You've been here at least fifty times.

137
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,190
Uh, pops?

138
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,060
Could you butt out? Please stop.

139
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,240
Huh? You're here today to complain again?

140
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,700
No, I'm just here for a drink today.

141
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,990
Is it that gorilla boss of yours again?

142
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,390
Pops, keep your mouth shut.

143
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,100
Stop it!

144
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,560
Huh, your boss is a gorilla?

145
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,750
Sounds hard... No wonder you want to complain.

146
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,130
No, you've got it wrong.

147
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,650
Though he's a gorilla.

148
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,620
It's not like I'm badmouthing him all the time.

149
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,520
That's right. Instead of badmouthing him all the time, you just go...

150
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,010
"Die!" usually.

151
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,980
Pops!

152
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,680
Die!

153
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,710
You die!

154
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,130
No, listen to me, big guy.

155
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,330
The mayo samurai's boss is always pestering this woman.

156
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,550
And this guy has to clean up afterwards every time.

157
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,480
I see. That sounds rough.

158
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,630
Sounds rough, but "Die!" was a little shocking.

159
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,300
No, when I say die...

160
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,300
It's like a figure of speech...

161
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,580
Like an expression of love...

162
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,760
If I really wanted him to die, I wouldn't tell him to die.

163
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,440
Hey, you understand, right?

164
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,460
Pops, raise the sign again. One more time.

165
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,420
You understand, right?

166
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,390
Look carefully. Look carefully at the fourth item!

167
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,680
Stare long and hard!

168
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,450
I got it. I got it. I got it.

169
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,510
Don't worry. Don't worry.

170
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,690
You understand, right?

171
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,970
Hold on, big guy.

172
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,470
Look carefully at the third item.

173
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,340
Hey, pops! I'm back!

174
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,580
Ah, Gori-san. It's been a long time.

175
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,140
What a troublemaker.

176
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,090
You're drunk already, aren't you?

177
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,330
Well, it was freezing out there today.

178
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,770
So I had a drink over there.

179
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,810
But now is when I get serious!

180
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,080
Oh, we've got ourselves a bunch of complainers here today!

181
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,880
This looks fun!

182
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,760
Ah?

183
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,450
Eh? What's wrong, Gori-san, Mayo Samurai-san?

184
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,480
You look pale.

185
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,360
Come on, what are you doing?

186
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,100
Slide over. Slide over.

187
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,140
Gori-san's got a big body, so make plenty of room.

188
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,620
Well, we were just enjoying ourselves.

189
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,880
Listening to the mayo samurai's story.

190
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,260
No, no, pops.

191
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,930
Can't we drop that subject already?

192
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,090
Can't we drop it already?

193
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,060
Huh? What? What story?

194
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,160
Fact is, this guy's boss is a gori-

195
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,520
Ah! What?! Is that UFO?!

196
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,240
Uh, you realize that UFOs are flying around all the time in this world.

197
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,080
And that gorilla's always pestering this woman and he thinks the gorilla should just die-

198
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,150
Look!

199
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,460
That's definitely a UFO!

200
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,370
Hey, let's go check it out!

201
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,560
Heh...

202
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,840
That kinda sounds rough...

203
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,600
Your boss is a gorilla, huh?

204
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,640
What a coincidence.

205
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,520
I have the same nickname as that person.

206
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,690
Ah, that's right, Gori-san.

207
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,600
Huh?

208
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,440
Gori-san, are you crying?

209
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,950
I'm not!

210
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,420
Not at all! Just got something in my eye!

211
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,150
I have allergies!

212
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,120
Uh, can I leave now?

213
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,960
Eh?

214
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,720
I'm feeling sick after drinking too much.

215
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,830
Hold on, Mayo Samurai-san.

216
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,630
Listen to what Gori-san has to say.

217
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,380
This gorilla's completely different from yours.

218
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,970
No, no, no, no, no! It's okay!

219
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,570
They don't need to hear my story!

220
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,420
This gorilla's in a relationship with a hostess girl right now.

221
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,330
Ah, wait!

222
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,820
And this gorilla is always watching over her as a bodyguard.

223
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,380
Wow... That's impressive.

224
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,820
He's her bodyguard...

225
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,180
A bodyguard that hides under eaves and stuff...

226
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,070
Great man, right?

227
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,090
You won't find anyone else like this these days.

228
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,030
You won't.

229
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,720
You won't find a bodyguard like that.

230
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
That wouldn't be called a bodyguard.

231
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,690
But even after everything Gori-san has done, this woman hasn't let him do...

232
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,660
Ah! Isn't that Kazuo Umezu?!

233
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,660
[Note: Kazuo Umezu is considered the godfather of Japanese horror manga.]

234
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,990
He's going as a customer, so you'd think she could show her appreciation by letting him...

235
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,230
Look!

236
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,100
That has to be Kazuo Umezu!

237
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,340
[Note: "Guwashi!" is a handsign used in the manga "Makoto-chan" by Kazuo Umezu.]

238
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,340
Let's all go and do the famous hand sign!

239
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,840
Don't you find this woman pathetic?

240
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,590
She's a terrible match for Gori-san here.

241
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,360
I keep telling him to break up with her,

242
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,910
but he's such a nice guy.

243
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,290
Good evening.

244
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,160
Ah, welcome, Pony-chan.

245
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,160
[Note: Nicknamed that after her ponytail.]

246
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,680
Er? Do you have the night off?

247
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,910
Yes, I was just stopping by on my way back from shopping.

248
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,690
Um, I made too many omelets,

249
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,680
so I thought I might offer my appreciation for imposing all the time.

250
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,420
Ah, ah...

251
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,170
Thanks as always, Pony-chan...

252
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,410
Um...

253
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,110
Ah! Have a seat. Have a seat.

254
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,430
Come on, men!

255
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,300
Slide over!

256
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,580
We've finally got a woman here.

257
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,860
Did you hear what we were talking about, Pony-chan?

258
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,800
No, I didn't hear a thing.

259
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,880
Ah, isn't that great, Gori-san?

260
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,870
You didn't lose your chance.

261
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,910
Why not switch over to this lady?

262
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,500
She's a good girl.

263
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,940
Huh?

264
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,560
What's wrong, everyone?

265
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,070
You're all pale as ghosts.

266
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,250
Gori-san...

267
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,090
Huh?

268
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,350
Gori-san's foaming at the mouth.

269
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,090
My, I wonder what's wrong.

270
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,510
Are you okay?

271
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,920
Huh? Something's growing out of his back?

272
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,260
Onion? It's a green onion.

273
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,980
Green onion growing from his back...

274
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,820
Or no, more than growing, it's burrowing in!

275
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,950
Gori-san!

276
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,200
This is terrible!

277
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,430
It must be a phantom killer.

278
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,810
The work of a phantom killer.

279
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,780
How terrifying...

280
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,770
I've never heard of a killer that stabs people with green onions!

281
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,980
This must be the work of a real monster.

282
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,090
To harden a sprig of green onion to such a degree and stab without being noticed...

283
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,680
[Note: A parody of HUNTER X HUNTER.]

284
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,680
They must be an enhancer type of nen power.

285
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,400
I should probably close up soon.

286
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,810
Don't worry.

287
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,780
The target's been eliminated, so the killer won't return to the scene of the crime.

288
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,350
Come, let's drink.

289
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,030
Pops, I'm taking Gori-san to the hospital!

290
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,740
I'm off then!

291
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,100
Sorry about this, Mayo Samurai-san.

292
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,360
Hey! Wait!

293
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,080
You're going to leave me alone here?!

294
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,610
Leave me alone in a cage with an enraged monster?!

295
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,510
What are you talking about?

296
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:23,260
N-No, I was worried about Gori-san, so I was thinking about tagging along...

297
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,040
But they're already gone.

298
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,810
That was fast!

299
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,840
All the way over there in no time!

300
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,580
Just forget about it.

301
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,690
Why not have a drink with me?

302
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,880
Oh, Pony-chan?

303
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,940
You prefer this guy over Gori-san?

304
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,650
I'll pour the sake for you.

305
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,600
That's nice. Quite a pretty picture.

306
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,820
You two look great together.

307
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,390
You think?

308
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,840
Do you come to this place often?

309
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,490
No, this is my first time here.

310
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:03,650
[Note: Parody of TV show  "Burari Tochu Gesha (Getting off the train early)."]

311
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:01,030
I just happened to get off the train early and noticed this oddly named place: the Whinery...

312
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,650
Uh, does P-Pony-ch...

313
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,600
Does Pony-sama come here to complain often?

314
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,530
It's been this long I'd say.

315
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,940
Ah, five times.

316
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,160
That's more than what I was expecting...

317
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,150
She's been coming here for five years.

318
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,130
Holy cow!

319
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,330
How much pent-up hate does she have?!

320
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,300
How much complaining has she done?!

321
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:27,790
The first time was when she came along with her late father long ago, who often came here to complain.

322
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,350
A bona-fide whinery!

323
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,270
A whinery specialist!

324
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,580
She's been through a lot, though she may not look that way.

325
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,800
She lost her parents when she was young

326
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,180
and she's watched over her little brother by herself this whole time.

327
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,700
That little brother is the problem.

328
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,120
Most of her complaining these days is about that little brother.

329
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,400
Ah, he must be an undependable little brother.

330
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,460
I can already picture it.

331
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,690
Glasses and that whole package.

332
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,570
Oh, the problem isn't with her brother but with the people around him.

333
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,400
Her brother seems to have joined a bad bunch of people.

334
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,500
Pony-chan, what was it about that permanently white-haired, always broke, and irresponsible...

335
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,080
Smegma Samurai.

336
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,850
Ah, that's it.

337
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,990
Smeggy Sammy.

338
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,120
Uh, is there really a need to abbreviate it?

339
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,520
Isn't that a little too cruel?

340
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,280
Her brother's gotten weird ever since he started working for Smeggy Sammy.

341
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,580
Tissues all over the place in his room.

342
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,910
Washing his underwear by himself in the morning.

343
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,000
He didn't used to be that way.

344
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's got nothing to do with Smeggy Sammy.

345
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
That's a part of nature.

346
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh? Really?

347
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
What kind of nature would this be?

348
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,360
Well, I'm sure that Smeggy Sammy is working hard in his own way.

349
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,500
The fact that the brother follows him when he has no money

350
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,590
shows how much he cares for the brother...

351
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,200
What could you possibly know about Smeggy Sammy?

352
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,580
I know more than you do!

353
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,630
I understand Smeggy Sammy 100%!

354
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:01,540
Well, she keeps complaining about how she can't do anything about Smeggy Sammy these days.

355
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,110
Well, it might be considered plotting instead of complaining.

356
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,850
What do you mean by plotting?

357
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,140
That sounds really scary...

358
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,010
Well, he seems to be very skillful, so she has to create her own opening.

359
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,960
Like letting him drink until he's completely smashed.

360
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,690
Hey!

361
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,390
What are you two plotting?!

362
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,320
What are you going to do to Smeggy Sammy?!

363
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,940
Oh, the green onion I bought is gone.

364
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,260
Excuse me, I need to go buy another one.

365
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,000
She just went to procure a weapon!

366
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,610
It was her!

367
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,430
She's going to leave a green onion sticking out of Smeggy Sammy's back!

368
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,800
O-Old man, I just remembered something I have to take care of.

369
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,140
I'll leave the money here.

370
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,780
Ah, hold on, big guy.

371
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,870
What?

372
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,740
I have something to tell you.

373
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,610
I've been listening to people complain for decades.

374
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,350
I've heard thousands, tens of thousands of complaints.

375
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,250
Badmouthing people, problems at work, stuff that gets you down.

376
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,220
But I was able to bear it all for decades.

377
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,960
That's because there's love behind every complaint.

378
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,790
Why won't things go my way when I'm working so hard at my job?

379
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,150
That's how it was with those other guys, right?

380
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,600
Complaints are just an expression of love when something doesn't go your way.

381
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,740
Like a form of bragging.

382
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,460
You should understand what I'm trying to say, big guy.

383
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,790
No, Smegma Samurai.

384
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,260
Take good care of Pony-chan.

385
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,550
Oh? He already closed.

386
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,200
Y-Yeah, something came up.

387
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,990
I see.

388
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,840
Wanna get a drink?

389
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,580
Huh?

390
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,300
I'm saying that if you still wanna drink, I'll tag along.

391
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,330
Are you sure?

392
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,420
You may have to listen to my complaints until morning.

393
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,770
That's fine.

394
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,410
Since I understand the true meaning of a complaint.

395
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,180
Wait!

396
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,840
I won't forgive you for holding hands with Pony-chan!

397
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,400
Gori-san! Don't force yourself!

398
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,690
The green onion's still in your back!

399
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,750
Who was that?

400
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,480
The next episode...

401
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,490
"Any place with a bunch of men gathered around will turn into a battlefield!"

402
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:25,110
[The Tsu Terakado Fanclub is in danger of disbanding! The cause of this crisis is...]

403
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,860
[(This week's complaint, or more like a realization) It's hard to do something you don't usually do.]

404
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,190
[See you next time.]
