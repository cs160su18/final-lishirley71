[Note: "Shura," the song just played, is performed by the band DOES]

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,080
[After all that, the Benizakura Arc has come to an end. Thank you for your hard work, DOES-san.]

5
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,050
[Starting from this episode, we'll be returning to the usual GinTama. Viewers tune in and get ready.]

6
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,540
Katsura and Takasugi, eh?

7
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,600
Katsura used to be an extremist, but now he's a moderate.

8
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,900
In fact, he keeps the easily agitated Anti-Foreigner Faction from running amuck.

9
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,030
It was only a matter of time before Katsura bumped heads with Takasugi and his more militant faction.

10
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,330
Both sides suffered huge losses. There were over fifty dead and missing.

11
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,850
Nizo the Butcher's whereabouts are also unknown.

12
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,050
Both sides will be out of action for a while.

13
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,150
But I still don't get it.

14
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,690
Takasugi had Okada, Kawakami and other fierce fighters on his side, but Katsura didn't have anyone.

15
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,820
How in the world did he manage to hold his own against Takasugi's group?

16
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,130
About that... I have some interesting information.

17
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,650
It seems Katsura had a strange team of helpers. They were...

18
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,360
a ridiculously strong silver-haired samurai and two strange kids.

19
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,750
Vice-Chief, do you think that might've been...

20
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,810
Him?

21
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,760
Seems that guy was involved with the Ikedaya incident with Katsura,

22
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,490
but he managed to get away.

23
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,660
Shall we check him out?

24
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,490
Vice-Chief...

25
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,690
He's always seemed a little fishy.

26
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,130
You must've realized it, too.

27
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,330
If we investigate, we might find a few skeletons in his closet.

28
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,700
He never did anything to attract attention, so I let him be, but...

29
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,240
It might be time.

30
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,750
What if we find out he's involved with the Anti-Foreigner Faction?

31
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,820
That should be obvious.

32
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,090
Whether he's a moderate or a radical, he's still our enemy.

33
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,800
Kill him.

34
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,830
["Even Mummy Hunters Sometimes Turn into Mummys"]

35
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,040
[Note: He's wearing a Seigaku uniform from Prince of Tennis]

36
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,770
[Note: He's wearing a Hyotei uniform from Prince of Tennis]

37
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,770
Wah!  It's huge!!

38
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,290
You're not there yet.

39
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,000
[Note: Ryoma's favorite phrase from Prince of Tennis]

40
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,780
Kill him...? The Vice-Chief's not being reasonable.

41
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,840
He already lost to that guy, so how am I supposed to beat him?

42
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,310
What's he thinking...?

43
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,660
I need to do something or he'll yell at me,

44
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,250
so maybe I should start by asking around.

45
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,600
Yamazaki-san, look out!

46
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,090
Huh? The Odd jobs? Thunder Dome?

47
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,500
Th-That's right.

48
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,090
If you know anything about them, can you please tell me?

49
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,770
Oh! That's no good!

50
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,700
You have to talk in Otsu language or I won't cooperate. Intestine burst!

51
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,700
If you've heard anything, I'd appreciate you letting me know. Shimantogawa Cooking Academy.

52
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,630
Hmm... The Odd Jobs is, how should I put it, someone I can rely on;

53
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,800
someone who'll do anything. But I have to pay him, of course. Fatal blunt force trauma.

54
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,510
No, I wasn't asking about his work.

55
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,920
I want you to tell me a bit more about his private side. Death Note.

56
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,550
About his private side?

57
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,650
Hmm... I don't really know. Middle-aged...

58
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,650
[Note: The person in the corner is from Mobile Suit Gundam.]

59
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,490
Huh? Gintoki Sakata?

60
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,660
Yes. I'd like you to tell me anything you know about the Odd Jobs boss.

61
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,370
Oh, please have one.

62
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,260
Thanks. That's considerate of you.

63
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,140
Yeah him... Him, eh? He's, you know...

64
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,010
Frankly, he's still a Madao.

65
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,010
[Note: MA-DA-O is an acronym for "MAttaku DAme na Otoko" which means a totally hopeless man]

66
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,140
Madao?

67
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,120
You know, it has a lot of meanings, but in essence it means he's hopeless.

68
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,990
If you ask me though, I think he's got something going for him.

69
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,400
But if you ask the people around him,

70
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,910
they'll say he loafs around, plays pachinko, and drinks.

71
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,660
The Odd Jobs boss does seem hopeless,

72
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,710
but I don't think that's all there is to him.

73
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,230
I think I need to find out and ask the people who are closer to him.

74
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,190
Are you listening?

75
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,100
Uh, yeah.

76
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,610
What sort of person is the boss of the Odd Jobs to you, Hasegawa-san?

77
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,610
Well, let's see... Someone you can't describe in a nutshell.

78
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,460
I see. I understand.

79
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,620
Are you listening?!

80
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,700
It's no use...

81
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,710
I can't understand him from what the people around him tell me.

82
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,750
Or rather, no one really understands him.

83
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,760
But...the more I investigate, the more mysterious the Odd Jobs boss becomes.

84
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,600
I guess I'll have to see for myself, after all.

85
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,700
'Zaki-san, look out!

86
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,210
Boss!

87
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,700
Odd Jobs Boss!

88
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,880
Huh? Not home?

89
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,620
I'm letting myself in.

90
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,980
Huh?

91
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,960
Boss?

92
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,110
Boss.

93
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,080
Boss.

94
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,660
Are you in here? Not here?

95
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,720
You. What're you doing there?

96
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,460
N-No...I'm...

97
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,810
Somehow, I sense we're alike. Are you a thief?

98
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,970
You said it. You just said you're a thief.

99
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,430
How dare you! I'm a former thief!

100
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,620
What's with the cocky attitude!

101
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,890
Don't look at me with those condescending eyes!

102
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,200
What're you getting angry at me for?!

103
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,520
What's going on, Catherine?

104
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,310
Oh, Otose-san.

105
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,480
Forgive me.

106
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,360
Is the boss in? Is the boss of the Odd Jobs in? This is for...

107
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,910
I'll take it!

108
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,920
It's not for you!

109
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,920
You said you wanted to see Gintoki?

110
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,790
He got hurt or something and is recuperating at Shinpachi's place.

111
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,530
Recuperating?

112
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Shinpachi Shimura's home... A broken down dojo...

113
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,310
It's a bother, but maybe I'll sneak in there tonight.

114
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,280
'Zaki-san! Look out!

115
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,140
Not this time!

116
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,630
Look Out!

117
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,620
Runaway horse!

118
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,220
Catch him!

119
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,910
This is the place.

120
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,810
It's bigger than I expected.

121
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,420
But this is getting more suspicious.

122
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,630
Could those injuries have been from that incident...?

123
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,240
If so, then...

124
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,760
Kill him!

125
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,880
Man, what does he want me to do?

126
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,290
I don't feel safe... I want to go home.

127
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,340
Who's there?!

128
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,350
Do they know?!

129
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,030
Oh, so it's you.

130
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,030
I thought you'd show up.

131
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,020
Holy cow. The boss is good-he saw though everything.

132
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,550
Have you come to avenge your dead friends, Muscat?

133
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,600
Huh? Muscat?

134
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,630
[Note: Spoof on Frieza from Dragonball.]

135
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,630
Are you talking about Marilyn? Prieza!

136
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,010
Dokaa. Bishi-bashi-bishi. Gufu. Dooon!

137
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,340
Gara-gara buri-buri ten, buri.

138
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,980
Buri-buri bushaa. Gara-gara gara goshi-goshi.

139
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,070
She's reading JUMP out loud... How tedious.

140
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,890
"Huh?" Goshi-goshi-goshi. Ack. "There's blood on you, again."

141
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,360
Hey, I'm completely lost. Give it to me-I'll read it myself.

142
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,590
No. JUMP is too stimulating for someone who's injured.

143
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,970
I'll read it to you.

144
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,960
Then read it the right way, so I can understand what's going on.

145
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,100
I'll sneak underneath.

146
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,400
Okay. Wait a minute. Something for Gin-chan...

147
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,440
Ahem. Manaka-dono, please turn off the light.

148
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,810
Ignoring Nishino's words, Manaka leapt atop her like a wild beast...

149
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,910
Never mind! That's enough! You're too young for this!

150
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,650
I told you not to move around!

151
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,660
Gin-san, how many times do I have to tell you before you understand?

152
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,260
If you move again with those injuries, you'll die. (I'll kill you.)

153
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,790
Sorry, but can I check into a hospital? I'm hearing things.

154
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,270
I thought I heard an ominous echoing voice say, "I'll kill you."

155
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,450
Ah! No! No! Don't get me wrong, it's not you, it's me.

156
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,360
You mustn't. If you checked into a hospital, you'd just sneak out.

157
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,600
If you're here, I can easily hunt you down.

158

You live here, right?

317
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,890
I heard that Gin-san was here. I couldn't open the gate, so...

318
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,020
I don't think you should go in there right now. It's dangerous. 'Bye.

319
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,890
Then...

320
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,390
Can I at least leave a message?

321
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,470
Tell him...a lot has happened to me, but I'm fine now.

322
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,900
Tell him...I'm truly grateful.

323
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,230
He probably doesn't even think about the Anti-Foreigner Faction's activities or politics like that.

324
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,820
I'm sure he just wanted...

325
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,840
to see that girl's smiling face. That's how I feel. Sagaru Yamazaki.

326
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,080
A composition?!

327
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,380
What's this? I'm in worse shape than I was before.

328
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:26,640
[Preview]

329
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,670
If samurai are dogs, then ninja are cats.

330
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,890
They'll cuddle up to anyone who has food.

331
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,640
There's no beauty or ugliness in the way we live.

332
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,050
The next episode... "The Preview Section in JUMP is Always Unreliable."
