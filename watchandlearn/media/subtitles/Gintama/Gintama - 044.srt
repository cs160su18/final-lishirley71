It'll get attacked! They'll get my shoulder!!

158
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,360
In my case, all of me is sticking out! They'll get all of me!!

159
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,310
Get out, you guys! This is for one person only. I built this by myself, for myself.

160
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,260
Anyway, why did you make it look like brick?! This isn't New York!

161
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,360
If you have any complaints, get out! I'll hide anywhere, even in a sewage canal, as long as it's with Gin-san.

162
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,280
Shut up. You're bothering me, too!

163
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,050
Whatever, you really stink. Don't touch me!

164
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,060
Humph. I love it when you talk rough...

165
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,580
You really stink! You smell like natto! Your fingers!

166
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,290
Huh? Where's Yellow Curry Ninja?

167
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,180
Hey, what are you doing, Zura?!

168
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,780
I'm not Zura. I'm a pine tree!

169
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,210
No, no! Impossible! You're totally in the open!

170
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,850
Gin-chan, look over there!

171
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,580
Elizabeth!

172
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,270
Zura, wait!

173
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,010
Ah, it's the intruder!! Stop!

174
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,360
Hey, look! This wall is strange! Like part of it is in New York!

175
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,280
Zura! What are you doing?!

176
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,220
White! Everyone! Please stick with me.

177
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,180
It's your fault they found us!

178
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,290
[NOTE: This is a spoof of the manga Detroit Metal City.]

179
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,790
I'll SATSUGAI you!

180
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,290
My curry is going to spill! I'm going to die!

181
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,230
Forget about your character, just throw it away!

182
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,900
Oh, no... If we don't do something, we'll end up getting destroyed.

183
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,540
Sachan-san, do you have any useful weapons?

184
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,400
Count on me! This will slow them down!

185
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,110
Maki...

186
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,140
[Note: Makibishi are small, spiked caltrops used by ninja to deter pursuing enemies.]

187
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,860
bi...

188
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,160
shi!

189
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,310
Damn it! We can't get any closer with these.

190
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,920
Oh! It worked perfectly as a barrier.

191
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,340
Just as I planned. That was Ninja Art Makibishi Circle.

192
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,000
You liar! It's stuck in your forehead!

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,670
Take that!

194
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,790
Die!

195
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,960
That's totally wrong! That's not how Makibishi are supposed to be used!

196
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,970
Magistrate!!

197
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,980
They're breaking through the mechanical traps, one after another! At this rate, they'll be here soon.

198
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,210
Don't worry about it. There's still...the final room...

199
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,740
What's this place?

200
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,710
Hey!

201
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,790
That's!

202
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,300
Elizabeth!

203
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,460
No! Don't get any closer...

204
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,600
E-Elizabeth...

205
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,600
That's too bad.

206
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,470
Elizabeth-chan isn't here.

207
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,370
You are...

208
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,510
Long time no see, Ayame Sarutobi.

209
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,920
Zenzo...

210
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,850
Sachan-san, you know this guy?

211
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,830
He's a former Oniwabanshu. Zenzo Hattori...

212
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,860
He possessed the most feared ninja techniques in the history of the Oniwabanshu.

213
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,090
I'm a freelancer now and I've been working for the big man here.

214
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,100
I'm sorry, but even if you are my ex co-worker, if you insist on sticking with these fools I'll show no mercy.

215
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,200
I don't care if you're a Go-Ninja or what...

216
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,440
But an amateur ninja can't beat a real ninja.

217
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,600
Even if you are a samurai...

218
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,250
We are...the strongest five.

219
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,180
Idaten no Gou!

220
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,180
[Note: Idaten = a devoted guardian]

221
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,200
[Note: Bishamonten = the chief of the Four Heavenly Kings]

222
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,200
Bishamonten no Shuwa!

223
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,400
[Note: Benzaiten = the Hindu goddess of wealth and eloquence]

224
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,400
Benzaiten Kaoru!

225
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,310
[Note: Komokuten = one of the Four Heavenly Kings]

226
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,310
Komokuten Matsuo.

227
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,620
[Marishiten = the goddess of heaven and light]

228
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,620
Marishiten, Zenzo Hattori.

229
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,130
We're five are...

230
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,720
Freelance Battle Squad, The Shinobi Five!

231
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:15,130
Katsura! No, Go-Ninja, this game will soon be over!

232
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,620
All members of the Shinobi Five used to work for the Oniwabanshu, and they're very good.

233
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,690
You'll die in front of your beloved Elizabeth-chan.

234
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,250
Elizabeth!

235
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,300
Gin-san!

236
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,090
We're your opponent...

237
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,130
JUMP Samurai!

238
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,300
Gin-san!

239
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,200
I never thought I would meet you in a place like this.

240
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,370
Every time I read JUMP, your face appears in my mind, and it's so annoying!

241
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,890
Wait, wait... Let's see... JUMP... JUMP...

242
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,340
Oh, I've got it! Are you the Isomura-kun to whom I never returned the copy of JUMP?!

243
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,780
Wait, let me explain...

244
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,480
I told you, I'm Hattori.

245
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,100
Hey, you! What?! Don't tell me you forgot about me!

246
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,520
So, you're Isomura-kun, right?

247
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm Ha-tto-ri!

248
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,350
Sorry, but I'm not good at remembering a

249
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,390
man's face!

250
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,380
If that's the case, I don't remember you, either! I don't know who you are!

251
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,210
Then...

252
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,220
There's no reason to fight!

253
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,350
Shut up!

254
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,290
I don't have to remember you to hate you!

255
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,390
Gin-san, be careful!

256
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,200
That man is very dangerous...

257
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,820
You're the one who needs to be careful.

258
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,970
Ah, what wonderful agility! You move just like a monkey.

259
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,340
Oh, I'm sorry. Do I have to call you Sachan? Osaru-san.

260
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,340
[Note: Osaru-san = monkey girl]

261
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,910
You're...the ninja academy Madonna, Kaoru-san Waki?

262
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,770
I'm sorry, but I didn't recognize you because you're much too flashy.

263
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,450
Humph. I didn't know Katsura was such a weakling.

264
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,710
Not only that, but the other two are just kids.

265
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,690
According to my data, our chance of winning is 99.8%.

266
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,050
What do we do? I don't think we can win against real ninja.

267
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,060
Curry, ready!

268
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,200
Curry? No! No! Don't say that like it's nothing!

269
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,560
What the hell kind of battle cry is that?!

270
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,570
Agh!! They've got them too! Has everyone gone insane or is it just me?

271
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,100
Unfortunately, we already calculated your chances.

272
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,850
If you strike, you face a 99.8% probability of being slaughtered.

273
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,980
Shut up! We won't know that until we try! Don't underestimate our Triple Curry!

274
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,090
Triple? Does that mean I'm in, too? Hey, am I also a member?!

275
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,890
We'll show you the difference between fake and real ninja!

276
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,940
Hot! A potato down my back! A potato is dancing on my back!

277
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,750
Hot!

278
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,770
We used the same technique, but with different results...This is the difference in our skills!

279
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,600
They're eating it!

280
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,690
Good grief... Our technique was completely outclassed.

281
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,660
You're more naïve than I thought!

282
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,520
You're the ones who are naive.

283
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,470
What...

284
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,610
Ugh! My stomach...

285
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,140
My stomach... You bastard, What did you do to that curry?!

286
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,530
Didn't your mommy tell you not to eat food from a stranger?

287
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,050
You dug your own graves by showing off your technique.

288
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,720
Learn common sense before learning ninja techniques.

289
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,570
You, too...

290
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,380
Leader! What happened?!

291
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,150
You, how could you?! I was a little hungry, so I had a bite!

292
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,480
You ate it, too?!

293
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,080
Well... I can overcome this kind of pain.

294
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,530
The kanji character "Shinobi" also means "to endure". Keep that in mind...

295
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,430
I'll show you my true ninja technique!

296
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,760
Ninja Art, "Shadow Clone Technique"!

297
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,420
You'll never figure out which is the real me!

298
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,580
You're completely unprotected!

299
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,850
Gou! Oh, no! Gou say something...

300
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,130
And... Now it's my turn.

301
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,830
Ninja Art, "Steroid Jutsu!"

302
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,780
Grow huge, my muscles!

303
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,150
Something got huge, anyway!!

304
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,160
This isn't good... According to my data, there's a 99.8% probability I'll be beaten in the next scene.

305
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,700
This scene!

306
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,390
H-Hey! What are you guys doing?

307
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,650
Hattori! What's is this? I thought you guys were the five greatest ninjas in the world!!

308
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,220
That's all wrong. The Pegasus Meteor Attack is like this...

309
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,340
Idiot. It's supposed to look like the Pegasus constellation.

310
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,830
Hattori! What are you doing? This isn't middle school recess!

311
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:01,960
[Note: Parody of the pegasasu ryusei ken technique from the JUMP manga/anime Saint Seiya]

312
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,950
Magistrate! The Pegasus Meteor Attack! It's like this, right?

313
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,960
Magistrate! Give him a clear "no" sign! This guy is an idiot! Idiot!

314
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,100
Both of you are idiots! Anyway, that technique is done like this! I recorded all the episodes!

315
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:15,590
You know, you were popular with certain boys, but they were all disgusting. Glasses fanatics...

316
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,380
Waki-san, your best friend Seki-san... She talks behind your back...

317
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,360
Is that what you call a fight?!

318
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,260
Gin-san!

319
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,930
We've got to end this quickly!

320
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,500
Kagura-chan's been struck by the worst blow ever suffered by a heroine!

321
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,170
For some reason, I'm not especially motivated.

322
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,170
I don't care about Elizabeth or if Kagura gets her feet wet.

323
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,630
Just wait...it'll I get better, shag-head! I'll poop more than my pants!

324
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,990
Leader, you gotta relax! Take deep breaths like me. C'mon.

325
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,280
What is she, pooping or having a baby?!

326
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,440
Everyone's so noisy... It's time for the showdown.

327
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,810
All right.

328
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,520
You and I think alike... I wish we'd met under different circumstances.

329
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,310
...Is that so...

330
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,330
Well, we already met under different circumstances!! I already told you!

331
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,740
...He disappeared?

332
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,080
Gin-san! Look out!

333
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,070
He's below me... How annoying.

334
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,360
What's this? Some sort of sweet scent...

335
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,250
My body...is numb!

336
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,330
How do my roses smell?

337
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:54,080
Ninja Art, "Coiling Aroma Attack!" Paralyzing all who sniff my poison rose!

338
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,300
Now, Zenzo! It's time for the final blow!

339
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,560
Saru! How can she move?! My technique didn't work?

340
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,090
Don't tell me she used the smell of natto to cancel out the scent of my roses?!

341
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,920
Ninja Art!

342
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,510
I will Natto give up!

343
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,500
Wake up, Gin-san!

344
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,260
Die!

345
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,550
JUMP Samurai!

346
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,690
The one to die...

347
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,760
is you!

348
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,780
Zenzo! Zenzo!

349
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,110
You're so mean! Zenzo has hemorrhoids! It stinks!

350
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,670
Th-This can't be...The Shinobi Five... No way...

351
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,320
I hope Kagura-chan makes it in time.

352
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,630
Eli...Elizabeth!

353
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,870
Oh, my goodness! Elizabeth! It's terrible! Absolutely terrible! Oh, no... This is...awful!

354
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,610
Hey, Zura... Isn't this kinda weird? It looks like something cottony is coming out...

355
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,470
That's right. And there's no blood, either.

356
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,750
Huh?

357
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,720
I already told you fools.

358
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,200
Elizabeth-chan isn't here. Elizabeth-chan was never here!!

359
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:29,970
You still don't you get it? Katsura, that old man...made an Elizabeth doll to lure you here.

360
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,130
You guys were duped.

361
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,970
Zura-kun... Hey, Zura-kun...

362
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,880
What's going on?

363
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,510
Come to think of it...

364
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,980
I forgot that we had a fight yesterday over who'd get Oage in their soba.

365
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:47,440
[Note: Oage = fried tofu on top of hot soba]

366
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,440
That means she just left the house because of the fight!

367
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,070
Gimme a break!! You owe us for all the trouble!

368
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,210
Hello! I have something to ask you.

369
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,790
Elizabeth, I've been looking all over for you. What were you doing?

370
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,520
What? The newspaper?

371
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,300
Can't you say "no"? They never let up. I don't have any money for it.

372
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,510
Anyway, I'll be late coming home again tonight. For dinner,

373
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,580
just take some hamburger out of the freezer and nuke it.

374
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,370
Eh, frozen food again? I'm getting tired of it. It's not fair.

375
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:38,000
I already know Mom puts on a lot of makeup and goes out with an unknown man to have tasty food.

376
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,170
Now look! You're being selfish. You made your father angry!

377
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:51,730
Elizabeth, where are you? Elizabeth!

378
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:27,180
[Preview]

379
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,180
Hey, Sadaharu! How did you get so big?

380
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,110
The next episode... "Walk Your Dog at an Appropriate Speed."

381
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,880
[Suddenly Sadaharu grows enormous and is the center of media attention.]

382
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,060
[And who are Ane and Mone, the self-proclaimed beautiful shrine maiden sisters?]
