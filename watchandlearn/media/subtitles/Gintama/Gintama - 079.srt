00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,100
[Shinpachi's Kodokan team and the Yagyu clan battle it out to bring back Otae.]

3
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,080
[Minamito, who asked for a second chance, was ruthlessly eliminated by Tojo.]

4
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,820
Having someone like you around would only disgrace the name of the dojo.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,390
I, Ayumu Tojo, head of the Four Yagyu Aces will not forgive anyone

6
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,320
who tarnishes our Young Lord's name.

7
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,530
Wait, Tojo.

8
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,660
I'm going, too.

9
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,070
I thought they were just a bunch of hooligans,

10
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,670
but it seems they're actually quite skilled.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,700
This is getting interesting.

12
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,540
There's no need for you to go, Young Lord.

13
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,700
I will defeat all five of them myself.

14
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,210
Never mind. I said I'm going.

15
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,150
But if you get injured, I will have to commit harakiri.

16
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,150
[Note: Harakiri is ritual suicide by disembowelment.]

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,830
So you think they're better than I am?

18
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,590
Absolutely not. You are invincible, Young Lord.

19
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,960
You are the hope of the Yagyu clan.

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,190
All right, then...

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,900
Just put these on and go... It looks like rain...

22
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:38,700
["Four Heads are Better than One"]

23
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,440
Cut it out! Can you please stop smothering me?

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,430
Ever since you were a baby, Young Lord,

25
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,880
it's been my duty to protect and care for you.

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,910
You are so very dear to me!

27
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,020
Please try to understand how I feel!

28
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,690
Young Lord! Look out!

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,490
Damn crow!

30
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,390
How dare you poop on my Young Lord!

31
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,780
I'll skewer and roast you like chicken!

32
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,870
I see...so they got Sogo.

33
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,480
Serves him right.

34
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,500
Hijikata-san, that's not a cigarette.

35
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,100
Where'd you get that?

36
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,300
Come on. Pull yourself together. Are you all right?

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,120
You're bleeding a lot.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,090
Seems we both underestimated each other...

39
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,740
I assumed it'd be easier.

40
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,430
Hijikata-san, it's burning.

41
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,690
I thought they only knew dojo swordplay, but I was totally wrong.

42
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,340
If their flunkies can fight like that, I worry about what's waiting for us.

43
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,860
Hijikata-san, that's very pretty.

44
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,070
Where the hell is your leader, anyway?

45
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,210
Beats me.

46
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,670
Probably got taken out a long time ago.

47
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,900
Kondo-san hasn't come back from the bathroom either. Is he okay?

48
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,380
Are you sure you're okay, Hijikata-san?

49
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,650
Yagyu...!

50
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,400
The big boys are finally making their move.

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,910
Hey! They're headed straight this way.

52
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,230
What's going on? How did they spot us?

53
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,590
Look at what you've got in your mouth!

54
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,420
This is bad. Let's retreat for now.

55
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,330
Right!

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,670
Kondo-san, hurry up!

57
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,400
Come on out. We've got to run! The enemy is...

58
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,640
Kondo-san?

59
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,110
There's no answer? Did he leave?

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,610
Pa-Pa...!

61
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,740
The paper!

62
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,420
Hijikata-san! Looks like Kondo-san's not here anymore.

63
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,820
We have no choice. Let's go!

64
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Right.

65
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,070
W-Wait! Toshi!

66
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,060
The paper's forsaken me! I'm still in here!

67
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,060
[Note: Pronunciation for "paper" is the same as "god."]

68
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,640
There's no toilet paper. I haven't wiped my butt yet!

69
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,090
This can't be! Did you really?! Did they really leave?

70
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,800
Shinpachi-kun! Toshi!

71
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,600
This sucks! I'm stranded in enemy territory with crap on my butt!

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,640
This is like when Garma got his ass shot by White Base.

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,640
[Note: Spoof of Mobile Suit Gundam 0079.]

74
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,320
What am I supposed to do?!

75
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,150
If I don't quickly do something, the enemy will find me!

76
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,420
I need something to wipe with!

77
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,920
Wait! Calm down, Isao!

78
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,460
This is a bathroom.

79
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,040
There are three other stalls.

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,390
The odds of all four being out of toilet paper are astronomical!

81
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,770
There's got to be a few sheets...somewhere!

82
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,900
Someone's in here!

83
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,660
Someone is crapping in here besides me. What luck!

84
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,160
I need help!

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm trapped in here! And I ran out of toilet paper.

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,180
Please... Can you please spare me a little?

87
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,120
The God of toilet paper has abandoned this place.

88
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,420
Huh? What did you just say? You're kidding, right?

89
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,880
Shut up, Gorilla, or I'll throw shit at you.

90
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,870
Huh? That voice?! Are you, Odd Jobs?!

91
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,310
Hey! What're you doing here?!

92
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,370
You know. We both came for the same reason.

93
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,160
What? You mean...

94
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,280
I was wondering where you were,

95
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,200
but does that mean you've been here for three episodes?!

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,380
Do you realize the rest of us have been locked in a desperate struggle?

97
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,800
Do you realize I've been locked in a desperate struggle of my own?

98
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,970
I think the bean bun I ate this morning was bad.

99
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,900
I shouldn't have bought so much when it was on sale.

100
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,130
You really like bean buns, Gin-chan.

101
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,120
Just when I thought I got it all out of my system, this happens.

102
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,370
I'm detoxed and depressed...

103
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,840
You can't be serious!

104
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,630
We have to get out of here.

105
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,310
There's got to be some paper in one of these stalls.

106
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,850
Paaaaper...

107
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,040
What's the matter?

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,690
A g-ghost...! There's a ghost! Like a miniature Yoda.

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:02,300
[Note: Spoof of the Japanese spirit "Zashiki Warashi" which lives in a house, but this one lives in a toilet.]

110
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,970
That's the toilet specter.

111
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,690
Was it Otae-chan? I think it was her cooking.

112
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,000
The toilet specter?!

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,300
It's what happens to people who get trapped in a bathroom with no way of wiping.

114
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,130
After I ate her cooking, it started spewing out...

115
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,470
Are you serious?

116
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,710
We're going to end up toilet specters too!

117
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,670
That's right. So hurry up and find some paper.

118
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,470
You want me to go out there with my butt exposed?

119
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,000
Better if you take everything off.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,050
If anyone asks, just say, "I'm Bigfoot, got a problem with that?" Be natural.

121
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,210
Why don't you go?! All you've done this whole time is detox, anyways!

122
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,290
Make yourself useful!

123
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,170
All you've been doing is providing commentary on other people's battles.

124
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,370
How dare you! Commentary is a thing of value!

125
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,260
A monkey can do commentary.

126
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,130
What?!

127
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,320
My, my. Sorry to interrupt.

128
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,620
We don't usually use these restrooms.

129
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,810
That's why we haven't restocked the paper.

130
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,370
And from a green perspective, we use toilet paper without tubes.

131
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,550
So of course it's impossible to unwind the core and use that to wipe with.

132
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,430
You are trapped like rats. How shall I finish you off?

133
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,510
Hijikata-san, are you okay?

134
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,490
Damn...maybe I should quit smoking.

135
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,370
Shape up!

136
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,770
That guy's awfully fast.

137
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,390
We can't outrun him.

138
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,240
Go.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,030
Hijikata-san?!

140
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,650
Don't worry. I'm not doing this for you.

141
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,540
I told you. I just came here to fight.

142
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,790
If you're defeated, we lose the fight.

143
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,110
Go find your sister.

144
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,090
Even if we win this battle, if your sister won't change her mind,

145
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,370
it will all have been for nothing.

146
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,530
The mayonnaise...will be on me.

147
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,530
So that's your captain?

148
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,000
Such a sorry captain-running off and leaving his injured teammate behind.

149
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,000
Just so you know, you cannot defeat our captain.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,230
Grandfather taught me the sword.

151
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,330
He's a master swordsman considered the greatest the Yagyu clan has ever produced.

152
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,040
Uh...I'm Bigfoot... Do you have any toilet paper?

153
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,100
What're you doing, Binbokusai-sama?

154
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,710
That didn't work at all!

155
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,930
Idiot. You actually tried it? You're an idiot.

156
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,900
Binbokusai-sama, we can't have our captain wandering around by himself.

157
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,420
It could keep us from winning.

158
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,070
I'm afraid this battle was decided before it ever began.

159
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,570
By now, Tojo has probably defeated the rest of your team.

160
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,520
He is the most skilled of the Four Aces.

161
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,600
There's no comparison between him and the other three who beat you so badly.

162
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,090
Damn Granny! I knew that egg this morning was bad!

163
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,370
We live everyday not knowing when we might bid farewell to this life.

164
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,240
I don't care if one of my comrades bites the dust.

165
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,920
I'll just kill that many more to make up for it.

166
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,820
They don't need any sad words. All I can do for them is...

167
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:34,610
keep fighting until I croak too...and give my best, like they did.

168
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,100
...Is this our best?

169
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,000
[Today's menu
Omelet, Egg and...]

170
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,910
Koshinori-sama, you mustn't!

171
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,300
Men are forbidden!

172
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,210
You may be the lord of the Yagyu, but this is a sacred sanctuary for women only!

173
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,440
Granny, this is no time for that. Out of my way!

174
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,450
Otae-chan! Summon Otae-chan!

175
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,200
What? That girl again?!

176
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,130
First you want her thrown out and now you want to summon her?

177
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,680
Make up your mind!

178
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,030
If she doesn't leave, then I will.

179
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,140
Choose that girl, or choose me!

180
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,280
Right! Right!

181
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,940
Don't talk like you're my girlfriend!

182
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,430
That's disgusting, you old hag!

183
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,930
With all due respect, the Young Lord cannot rein in that woman.

184
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,960
She is an incorrigible tomboy!

185
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,940
She will bring disaster to the Yagyu clan.

186
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,860
We already have a disaster.

187
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,680
I don't know if they're dojo busters or what, but I'm at my wit's end.

188
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,330
Kyubei and those wild Four Aces are wreaking havoc.

189
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,180
They're tearing up the place.

190
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,860
What's more, one of the ones who barged in here is calling himself Otae-chan's brother.

191
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,590
I don't know what's going on! I need to talk to her!

192
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,300
Her brother?! How frightening!

193
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,570
They are all of barbarian blood, after all!

194
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,600
How scary!

195
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,630
Out of my way!

196
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,620
That's...!

197
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,050
Otae-chan!

198
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,450
Stop! Hellion!

199
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,310
Shin-chan... Everyone...

200
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,410
I never imagined the enemy captain would be an old man.

201
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,990
But we won't go easy on you. Let's settle this like men.

202
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,850
What're you talking about?

203
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,470
You don't stand a chance against me. I guarantee it.

204
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,630
Right back at you, old man.

205
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,040
Don't you see? You're already trapped like a rat.

206
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,960
There's no rush. We'll butcher all of you.

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,380
But first things first.

208
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,580
Somebody! Bring us toilet paper!

209
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,240
This is ridiculous!

210
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,980
Their captain is within striking distance and we can't do a thing!

211
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,040
Tojo-san, was it? What's your problem, anyway?

212
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,800
Weren't you gloating a moment ago?

213
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
I couldn't hold it in.

214
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,180
I feel much better now.

215
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,880
Oh no!

216
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,550
Do you know why we have two hands? It's so that...

217
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,800
Don't go there, Odd Jobs! Don't lose hope.

218
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,030
Binbokusai-sama?

219
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,630
You aren't talking. Are you all right?

220
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,800
The enemy is trying to trick you!

221
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,720
Hold on. This is no time to be talking about enemy this and enemy that.

222
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,400
We can't do shit if we're stuck in here.

223
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,310
Don't use the word "shit"! I'm upset enough as it is!

224
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,750
The main priority is to get some toilet paper.

225
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,510
What do you say we postpone the match until we've wiped our butts?

226
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,320
So let's call a truce.

227
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,950
Team up with the enemy? Do you think I'd fall for that?

228
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,330
That stinks! How long are going to keep letting it out?!

229
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,680
Tojo, we have no choice.

230
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,070
Let's forget about the match and concentrate on wiping our butts.

231
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,720
You say cooperate...but do you have any ideas, Odd Jobs?

232
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,940
We don't have paper, but we have our minds.

233
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,810
Four adults together should be able to come up with something.

234
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,490
We're four adults, but we're four adults with poop on our butts.

235
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,700
What can adults like us do? Are we even adults?

236
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,400
Don't belittle yourself.

237
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,930
These are the times when you need to keep the integrity of your spirit.

238
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,460
Human beings must never lose their dignity.

239
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,820
Those are fine words, but the guy who said it has miso on his butt, too.

240
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,150
Let's start by examining our situation.

241
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,300
This stall has no toilet paper...nor does any stall.

242
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,810
Because it is normally not used, it's unlikely that anyone will come.

243
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,990
We can't even put on our hakama without wiping our bottoms.

244
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,990
[Note: A hakama is a Japanese traditional skirt.]

245
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,170
So we cannot go and get help.

246
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,200
You're saying we're on our own?

247
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,590
Start by taking out everything you've got.

248
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,090
That's not what I meant.

249
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,580
I don't have any paper.

250
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,600
If I did, I'd have wiped my bottom and killed them all.

251
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,400
The same is true for them. They all know that.

252
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,170
So why did he bring that up?

253
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,650
Odd Jobs must know something.

254
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,190
Under these extreme circumstances,

255
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:01,250
working together will create a strong sense of camaraderie between us.

256
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,720
The enemy is trying to trick us into thinking they're not our enemy by working together with us.

257
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,870
They're doing it to put us off guard so they can attack.

258
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,120
There isn't a single one among us who plans to cooperate.

259
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,220
If I show any opening, they'll get me.

260
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,600
Not only that...

261
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,520
I have to outwit them and wipe my butt first.

262
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,440
If they beat me to it, they'll get me for sure.

263
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,250
Paper...

264
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,110
Paper...

265
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,110
Paper...

266
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,970
Paper...

267
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,780
Paper...

268
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,560
Whoever gets his hands on some first wins the match!

269
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,350
Found anything useful?

270
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,000
How should I respond?

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,870
Nope.

272
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,260
Nothing here, either.

273
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,760
Should I go along with their plan?

274
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll show an opening, and when they attack, I'll...

275
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,420
Hey, will this work?

276
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,520
Binbokusai-sama?!

277
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,990
I have sandpaper.

278
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,270
Sand...

279
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,510
Did he say sandpaper?

280
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,510
Don't be ridiculous! It would rip our anuses apart!

281
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,420
Normally, that's what I would say...

282
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,970
But in this situation, sandpaper...

283
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:13,570
seems like the high-end lotion tissue "SCoTchie" with anti-bacterial moisturizers...

284
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,750
I want it bad!

285
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,730
Don't be ridiculous, old fart!

286
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,860
Wiping with that will make us bloody all over!

287
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,070
Wait! Calm down, Odd Jobs! Don't let him fool you!

288
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,930
Don't let the word "sand" trick you.

289
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,760
It's sand, but the word "paper" comes after it.

290
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,100
It's the paper we're dying to get.

291
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,610
No, could it all be an act so we don't notice that he wants the sandpaper?!

292
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,840
I see. It's still in enemy hands.

293
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,160
If they see that I want it, it'll show weakness.

294
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,620
By skillfully hiding that, and refusing,

295
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,860
Gin defuses the old man's interest in the sandpaper and intends to cunningly get it from him.

296
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,790
He's several moves ahead of us all.

297
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,350
I've been going against such an incredible fellow all this time?

298
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,180
But today, he's my ally.

299
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,750
I couldn't ask for a more dependable ally. I'm going to back him up.

300
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,050
Cut it out, old fart! Sandpaper?

301
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,100
Try sanding your brain!

302
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,230
I won't let you win!

303
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,530
Bimbokusai-sama, what we need is paper.

304
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,070
Sandpaper's no good to us.

305
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,350
Flush it down the toilet and yourself along with it.

306
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,260
What?!

307
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,950
In this situation,

308
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,760
sandpaper is equal to the high-end lotion tissue "SCoTchie" with anti-bacterial moisturizers...

309
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,630
"SCoTchie"? Oh, don't be so presumptuous.

310
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,630
Don't let the word "paper" fool you!

311
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,870
The word "sand" is in there too, you old fart!

312
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,870
Hey, you two, that's going too far!

313
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,890
There might be a way to use it.

314
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,610
Old man, let me have a look at that.

315
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,110
H-H-H-He's...

316
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:56,440
[Note: Slang for a character that at first seems mean and nasty but later turns out to be nice. Commonly appears in Visual Novels as seen below.]

317
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,250

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,440
Oh come on, let me see it!

319
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,210
He was cold before and now he's turned nice!

320
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,460
If he did that at the right moment...

321
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,030
Even a battle-hardened bar hostess would fall for him!

322
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,990
It's incredible! To use such a gambit...

323
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,770
This man...

324
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,140
That's right. This man had everything figured out.

325
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,060
He knew we would read his strategy, imitate it, and insult the old man.

326
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,340
He had it all figured out, and used it to his advantage...

327
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,260
This can't be!

328
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,850
That would mean this man played me for a fool!

329
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,920

What an incredible man... He's in a league of his own.

335
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,630
We lost. We've been completely crushed...

336
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,380
Sandpaper?

337
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,110
Sandpaper!

338
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,610
Now all four of us have some.

339
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,620
What? What's going on?

340
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,120
Old man! Odd Jobs! Are you really cooperating?

341
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,420
It's three-times rougher than I thought! And it's two-sided!

342
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,800
If I wipe my bottom with this, it'll rip the skin right off!

343
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,100
In the end, we have no choice but to wipe with this.

344
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,300
Not that I'd recommend it, though.

345

No way...

The old man...couldn't be...

348
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,580
He's wiping! No doubt about it! With this sandpaper!

349
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,730
I-It's unbelievable!

350
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,880
Even with my thick butt hairs, this scares the hell out of me.

[Note: Like Pervy sage in NARUTO.]

354

Binbokusai-sama...that was brilliant.

357
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,590
This was all a ploy to apply psychological pressure.

358
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,270
In this situation, without toilet paper,

359
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,350
they'd be pressured into making a decision whether to wipe or not to wipe.

360
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,250
Once they've lost their presence of mind, they'd be at our mercy.

361
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,930
Old man, this is incredible! It's awesome!

362
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,730
Huh?

363
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,660
Coarse...so coarse! It really hits the spot!

364
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,010
No, he's fooling.

365
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,780
Wait a minute...no way...

366
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,190
Is he wiping? No, he couldn't be.

367
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,770
No, he is... He's wiping with it!

368

Th-That's absurd!

369

He's a Count...

In the far west...

372

there was a man who whipped his butt with a hot sausage...

373

What should I do? Do I wipe?

376
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,540
Must I wipe? Am I leaning towards wiping?

377
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,170
No way, no way, no way.

378

No, nix bungee jumping.
