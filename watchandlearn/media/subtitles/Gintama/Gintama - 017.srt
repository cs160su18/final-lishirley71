[Twenty years since the arrival of the Amanto.
A festival to commemorate the country's opening.]

3
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,080
[Gintoki and friends are helping Gengai repair his robot for the festival.]

4
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,420
Who's there?

5
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,300
Zura...

6
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,300
Still on the run from the Bakufu, huh?

7
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,910
It's not Zura, it's Katsura.

8
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,150
Why are you here?

9
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,270
Heard you escaped from the Bakufu's pursuit and were laying low in Kyoto.

10
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,990
I couldn't resist after hearing there was a festival going on. So here I am.

11
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,310
Better keep that love of festivals of yours under control.

12
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,920
[Bakufu is a common term for the Shogunate or government]

13
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,730
The Bakufu hates you even more than they hate me.

14
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,920
You'll get yourself killed.

15
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,910
No way would I miss a festival that the Shogun himself is going to attend.

16
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,750
How did you know?

17
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,030
You're not gonna...?!

18
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,140
I don't intend to do anything that outrageous. But that would be fun.

19
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,060
If the Shogun's head should fly during the festival,

20
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,750
the Bakufu and the entire country would be turned upside down.

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,040
["Sons Only Take After Their Fathers' Negative Attributes"]

22
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,000
Hey! You old geezer! Hiraga, you bastard get out!

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,820
Do you have any idea how much trouble

24
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,150
you've caused everyone in the neighborhood?

25
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,480
["Gashakon" is a very loud, clunky noise]

26
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,500
"Gashakon, gashakon" day and night!

27
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,480
You some kind of Gashakon Warrior or something?!

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,470
I don't give a damn if you're the top inventor in Edo! You build nothing but junk.

29
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,060
The Kabukicho Block Association has had it with you!

30
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,460
Go get 'em, men!

31
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,470
First up, Shinpachi Shimura from Kabukicho. Thank you!

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:46,420
Cho-me cho-mee cho-me cho-mee!

33
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,590
Good lord! I said to stop the noise!

34
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,120
What is this?! You're making it worse!

35
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,410
The two noises are creating a harmony!

36
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,400
The best way to handle a bully is to bully him right back.

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,050
A guy who's never been punched doesn't know how it hurts.

38
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,660
You're the one who doesn't get it!

39
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,180
My eardrums are about to burst!

40
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,740
What're you talking about, old lady?

41
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,760
Shinpachi's the one who's really suffering.

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,530
He's showing off in public that he can't sing.

43
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,370
Looks to me like he's having a blast!

44
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,190
Shinpachi, let me sing next.

45
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,990
I bought the latest song by Goro Kitajima.

46
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,110
Come on... Hey, are you listening to me, tone-deaf?!

47
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,690
What?! Cut it out!

48
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,690
Oh, man... What're they doing?

49
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,040
Sheesh!

50
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,340
Heeey! I'm singing next!

51
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,490
What did you people come here to do, anyway?!

52
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,950
Forget it. If I have to listen to you guys sing, I'd rather sing myself!

53
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,890
Give me that!

54
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,130
No one wants to hear you sing!

55
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,390
Keep quiet, you rotten old hag!

56
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,280
How dare you?! Then how about a duet, damn you!

57
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,510
Huh? What?! This is Hiraga-san?!

58
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,010
You're taking my head off!

59
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,760
I said you're taking my head off, Hiraga-san!

60
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,040
Stop it, Hiraga-san!

61
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,310
Idiots! I'm Hiraga.

62
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,870
You brats are making a terrible racket in front of my house.

63
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,070
Think about all the trouble you're causing the neighborhood!

64
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,530
That's you, you old geezer!

65
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,790
That racket you're making is driving everyone in the neighborhood gashankon crazy!

66
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,590
I don't recall ever making a racket that went "gashankon"!

67
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,620
It's gashuiin-gasshan!

68
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,330
Gengai, you're not young anymore.
Try to live in peace and quiet.

69
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,590
You intend to have those wind-up toys look after you in retirement?

70
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,940
Shut up, old hag!

71
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,360
I don't care how many times you come-I'm not closing up the shop!

72
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,290
Go home!

73
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,940
Hey, Saburo! Don't hold back. Force them out!

74
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,570
Affirmative.

75
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,220
Hey, wha...? Wait!

76
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,790
[Gengai's Retreat]

77
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,450
Wow! It's a mountain of robots.

78
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,560
Did you make all of these, Hiraga-san?

79
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,990
What're you guys doing, packing up without permission?! Dammit!

80
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,790
Untie these ropes!

81
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,390
Hey, get me some tea.

82
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,370
Affirmative.

83
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,230
Saburo! Why're you working like their servant?! Help me!

84
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,150
Boy, you sure make truly good stuff, old man.

85
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,900
Can I get one of these tin cans for myself?

86
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,280
Huh?

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,110
Hot diggity!

88
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,040
Serves you right!

89
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,500
Saburo can understand human languages to a certain extent.

90
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,730
He responds to people who use aggressive words or actions with his iron fists.

91
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,380
Okay! Release me from these ropes now! Hurry up, you bucket-of-bolts!

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,190
Otose-san, is that man really Edo's top inventor?

93
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,930
Huh? That's what I hear.

94
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,560
But to us, it looks like just junk, you know.

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,920
It's not junk.

96
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,060
Creating something is like materializing your soul into reality.

97
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,650
These are all my beloved sons.

98
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,190
Your son's tangled up over there with a delinquent.

99
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,560
No!

100
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,130
Rocket Punch Fire!

101
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,130
Stop!

102
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,400
He can't do that!

103
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,340
You're just tearing his arms off!

104
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,820
That should do it.

105
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,870
You can make as much noise as you like out here.

106
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,430
Do it all you want.

107
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,060
All I want? But they're all broken to bits...

108
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,340
What have you bastards done?

109
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,620
Don't worry. Sabu is okay.

110
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,260
Affirmative.

111
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,040
Don't "Affirmative" me! It's shaped differently!

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,290
You're missing your arms! Your arms!

113
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,020
What am I going to do?! I won't be able to finish in time for the festival!

114
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,200
Festival?

115
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,050
In three days,

116
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,840
there's going to be a festival to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the country's opening to the Amanto.

117
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,760
Even the Shogun is going to make a rare public appearance.

118
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,870
I have direct orders from the Bakufu to have my robots perform at the ceremony.

119
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,110
What am I going to do?

120
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,210
If I don't finish in time, I'll have to commit seppuku!

121
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,920
Uh-oh, I forgot I was making curry...

122
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,390
Hey! Give me back Saburo's arms!

123
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,160
Darn those kids... They're crazy.

124
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,500
Will you be all right?

125
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,940
I've got no choice, do I? If I work around the clock, I might...

126
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,550
Not that. I meant your son.

127
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,280
If I'm not mistaken about your son, didn't the Bakufu...?

128
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,040
Otose, the trick for an old man to live a long life is to quickly forget the bad things.

129
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,150
And, I've told you before, these are my sons now.

130
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,130
Dad! Dad, please stop!

131
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,350
What good will making a robot that kills do?!

132
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,050
Dad, didn't you say that you wanted robots to help people?!

133
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,040
And that time is now.

134
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,650
If things remain as they are, this country will be taken over by the Amanto.

135
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,000
This is the only thing I can do.

136
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,100
Then I'll fight instead.

137
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,510
What're you talking about?

138
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,640
Dad, you stopped smiling long ago.

139
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,530
You know, Dad...

140
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,640
I loved watching you work happily on your robots...all covered in grease.

141
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,110
Like a kid playing in mud.

142
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,890
I don't want to see you working with such a grim look on your face.

143
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,300
Hey, wait!

144
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,810
Wait, Saburo!

145
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,370
Listen up. On the day of the festival,

146
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,370
the Shinsengumi will protect the Shogun with every last man.

147
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,950
If the Shogun so much as gets a scratch, our heads will roll!

148
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,180
Keep that in mind!

149
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,220
If you see anyone suspicious, kill them without hesitation!

150
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,680
I'll take full responsibility.

151
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,400
For real? In that case, I'll start by killing every samurai in sight.

152
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,630
You can take the consequences.

153
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,840
Okay, guys! Disregard that last order.

154
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,800
Also, although this intelligence is still unconfirmed,

155
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,500
we have information that someone really dangerous is in Edo.

156
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,510
Someone really dangerous? Who could that be?

157
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,780
Remember that incident where over a dozen government officials

158
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,080
got assassinated during a dinner meeting?

159
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,820
That was his work.

160
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,330
The most radical and dangerous man among the Anti-foreigner faction.

161
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,420
His name is Shinsuke Takasugi.

162
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,040
Let's invite Yo-chan, too!

163
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,890
This sweet smell must be

164
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,000
cotton candy.

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,660
Cotton candy!

166
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,030
Damn.

167
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,980
Quit playing and get back to work!

168
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,300
Good grief, we're short on time!

169
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,820
But Hiraga-san, the festival has already begun.

170
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,190
We came to help you, but we're not going to make it.

171
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,000
The robot performance doesn't start till tonight.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,560
If we can somehow finish by this evening, we'll manage.

173
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,810
Don't play dumb!

174
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,250
You think I wouldn't know about it?!

175
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,190
This shirt has lipstick all over it!

176
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,000
You can't lie to me anymore!

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,950
Affirmative.

178
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,020
"Affirmative, Afffirmative"...

179
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,560
That's all you ever say!

180
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,140
That's why your subordinates look down on you!

181
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,870
Try saying "No" for a change, you perpetual manager!

182
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,660
Affirmative.

183
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,180
That's it! Domestic Violence!

184
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,890
What're you doing?! Stop that!

185
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,370
Who is she?!

186
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,470
It's Sachiko, isn't it?

187
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,690
That ugly witch who came to our housewarming party!

188
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,390
Stop it, I said! What sort of sick soap opera are you playing?!

189
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,590
It might be playing to you, but to me, it meant everything in the world!

190
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,710
We somehow managed to finish on time.

191
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,790
Though there are problems in spots.

192
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,450
Hmph!

193
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,440
If you guys hadn't shown up, I wouldn't have had any problems.

194
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,630
Get off your pedestal, you public hazard geezer!

195
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,330
We only came 'cause the old hag forced us.

196
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,010
I still have final adjustments to make.

197
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,010
You'll only get in the way, so go to the festival or something.

198
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,600
Gin-chan, hurry, hurry!

199
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,990
Thank you, Hiraga-san!

200
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,280
Hmph.... They sure are a rowdy bunch. Right, Sabu...

201
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,870
Saburo!

202
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,410
Hey, you can't go! Saburo!

203
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,120
Let's eat fried udon next!

204
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,570
How odd... Almost looks as if Saburo's having fun too.

205
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,710
Well, anything's more fun than hanging out with a grim-faced old geezer like you.

206
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,880
You say the same thing my son did.

207
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,150
Son? You had one?

208
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,650
He already died, though.

209
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,860
He went off to war on his own and died.

210
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,470
He loved robots every bit as much as I do.

211
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,280
A brat who would sneak in to tinker with machines.

212
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,490
When I think back now, that might've been the happiest time of my life.

213
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,220
Back then I tinkered with robots because I loved them.

214
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,690
But ever since people started calling me the greatest inventor in Edo and such,

215
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,280
robots just became a means to an end.

216
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,380
That son of mine rebelled against me for that and left me.

217
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,440
And that was it.

218
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,240
That reminds me. I heard from Otose that you went to war, too.

219
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,700
It wasn't anything grand.

220
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,020
Though, I still lost many friends.

221
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,250
Don't you want to avenge them?

222
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,100
Huh?

223
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,680
Haven't you ever thought of striking at the Bakufu and the Amanto for the friends you've lost?

224
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,430
Old man, you're not...

225
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,550
Oh, shoot.

226
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,160
I have some final adjustments to do, so I'm going back.

227
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,790
Hey! Saburo, let's go.

228
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,580
Oh, it's that old dude.

229
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,890
Oh no! It's that girl with the venomous tongue!

230
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,040
If it isn't Hasegawa-san!

231
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,000
You found a job! Congratulations!

232
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,030
Well, yeah.

233
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,890
Are the two of you...on a date?

234
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,650
A shooting game? Maybe I'll have a try.

235
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,240
Oh, sure! Go ahead, go ahead!

236
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,490
It's on me!

237
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,790
If I hit it, will you give me anything I want?

238
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,640
Sure, I'll give it to you.

239
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,470
Take good... aim and...

240
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,480
Hand over your shades.

241
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,620
What? You did it wrong... You were supposed to aim that way.

242
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,550
The watch is mine.

243
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,950
Now just a minute!

244
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,290
Wait! Come on!

245
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,980
I said I'd give you anything, but you can't have something of mine!

246
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,290
Hey! Are you listening?!

247
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,730
Got the beard.

248
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,420
Score the jacket.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,720
A hit on the nipple!

250
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,070
Toshi, Sogo hasn't been back since he said he had to go take a dump.

251
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,790
That bastard's goofing off again.

252
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,070
Toshi, you can doubt anyone else, but not one of our own.

253
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,100
I believe in Sogo.

254
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm sure he's having a hell of a time pushing it out. That's what I believe.

255
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,090
If that's what you're going to believe, I think he'd be better off if you doubted him.

256
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,810
But that damn Yamazaki sure is late.

257
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,740
What happened?

258
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,420
The Shogun said he wants to eat takoyaki.

259
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,250
He doesn't have a care in the world.

260
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,810
Vice-Commander! I have returned!

261
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,260
You're late! You better have had them put mayonnaise on it!

262
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,370
Hey, this looks like...

263
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,930
Actually, I was in such a rush that I tripped and they fell out on the way back.

264
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,800
Forgive me. I, Sagaru Yamazaki, have made a blunder I will regret my entire life.

265
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,580
I see. I thought the green nori flakes around your mouth was the blunder you'd regret your entire life.

266
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,500
Yamazaki!

267
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,690
Vice-Commander, this isn't what you think!

268
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,530
This is the green nori from the okonomiyaki I ate along the way!

269
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,150
It doesn't matter!

270
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,220
Hey, what are we going to do?

271
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,540
You're eating it!

272
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,730
Don't get so upset, Toshi.
Today is the festival.

273
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,540
I can't help it.

274
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,950
That bastard Takasugi has no political beliefs at all.

275
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,670
He only enjoys creating chaos.

276
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,180
There's no way a guy like that is going to overlook a huge festival like this!

277
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,560
Oh! It's started.

278
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,170
The show by Edo's top robot puppeteer, Gengai Hiraga!

279
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,740
A festival has to be loud to be interesting, that's for sure.

280
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,310
Don't move.

281
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,150
To think the man they called the White Knight would let someone attack him from behind.

282
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,330
Gintoki, have you lost your edge?!

283
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,900
What're you doing in a place like this?

284
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Just shut up and watch.

285
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,200
An incredibly fun show is about to begin.

286
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,960
Saburo, let's do it.

287
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,020
Affirmative.

288
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,310
Fire!

289
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,890
It's a terrorist attack!

290
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,580
It's the Anti-Foreigner Terrorists!

291
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,160
Is this a smokescreen?

292
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,690
You men secure the area around the tower!

293
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,280
Don't let even a mouse get near the Shogun!

294
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,950
R-Robots!

295
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,040
An army of robots!

296
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,470
The crowd has run off.

297
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,910
Okay, go!

298
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,250
Men, charge!

299
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,890
Do you remember, Gintoki?

300
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,560
How I once led a volunteer army called the Kiheitai?

301
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,670
There was a man named Saburo.

302
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,950
He wasn't any good with the sword, but he was incredibly good with machines.

303
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,790
He said he didn't join to fight a war; he came to fight his father.

304
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,590
His father was all he ever talked about.

305
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,910
But he died without ever returning to his father.

306
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,840
What a sad story.

307
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,210
We all risked our lives to protect our country from the Amanto,

308
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,030
but the all-important Bakufu quickly welcomed the Amanto.

309
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,610
Even the Kiheitai was no exception.

310
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,190
We were caught in the purge, and eventually destroyed.

311
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,840
When he saw his son's head exposed for public viewing by the riverbed,

312
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,470
who knows what his old man thought.

313
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,740
Takasugi, were you the one who egged the old man on?

314
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,720
Egged him on?  Don't be ridiculous.

315
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,970
His fangs were already showing.
I just polished them.

316
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,550
You see...I know the suffering that old man is going through.

317
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,280
There still remains a black beast of vengeance inside of me, as well.

318
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,060
Thrashing about all day and all night, saying in my ear

319
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,850
"Kill. Kill the enemies of my friends. Make them suffer the way we suffered."

320
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,420
Gintoki, can't you hear those voices?

321
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,430
No, I suppose you can't.

322
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,070
Looking away from the past and living a carefree life...

323
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,600
You've lost your fangs to indifference-you couldn't understand how we feel.

324
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,100
Don't underestimate me, Takasugi...

325
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,700
I've got a beast of my own too.

326
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,560
It...won't move.

327
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,580
But the beast is a white one.

328
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,890
What's its name?

329
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,130
He's called Sadaharu.

330
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,860
No waaay! My famed blade, Kotetsu-chan is...!

331
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,300
Toshi, my Kotetsu-chan got... No waaay!

332
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,310
Shut up! This isn't the time for that!

333
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,920
But I'm still paying off the loan. No waaay!

334
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,690
Hmph.

335
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,910
We keep cutting them down, but they keep coming back. There's no end.

336
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,820
What was that?!

337
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,350
Who are the bad boys who're

338
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,480
ruining the festival?

339
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,110
Ah! That's the "Festival Music Lover"!

340
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,480
An ancient spirit who punishes biker gangs who interfere with festivals!

341
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,730
Uh... I don't think so.

342
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,930
The god of festivals has come!

343
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,530
Victory is ours!

344
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,760
Next, we use real bullets.
Aim carefully, Saburo.

345
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,770
Affirmative.

346
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,530
Please stop this right now!

347
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,060
The Shogun escaped already.

348
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,090
That so? My eyes are going bad, so I couldn't see that.

349
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,780
Well, that's okay. Then I'll go after that group called the Shinsengumi.

350
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,900
Hiraga-san!

351
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,130
Hey, hey.

352
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,720
That's quite a dangerous show you're putting on out here.

353
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,580
Is it some sort of superhero show?

354
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,510
Let me play the hero!

355
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,440
You're not good enough for the role. Out of the way.

356
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,340
Who're you to diss the actor when you wrote such a crappy script?

357
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,220
Revenge flicks are so outdated.

358
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,990
You are making Saburo cry.

359
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,010
Which Saburo?

360
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,070
Both of them.

361
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,720
Nobody wants something like this.

362
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,090
You know that better than anyone else.

363
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,540
I do know that.

364
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,290
But it hurts so much...

365
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:41,470
Letting my son die like that, while this old body continues to live on.

366
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm tired of living my life just staring at useless things.

367
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,890
Actually, I don't really give a darn about the Shogun's head.

368
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,920
I fully realize that there's nothing I can to do for someone who died.

369
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,770
All I want is to live by my principles and die.

370
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,730
So get out of my way.

371
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,270
I'll show you no mercy if you get in my way.

372
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,550
I'm not moving.

373
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,070
I have principles I live by, too.

374
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,570
Fire!

375
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,930
Saburo!

376
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,450
You idiot! Why didn't you fire?!

377
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,840
D-Dad...

378
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,520
I loved... watching you work... happily on your robots...all covered in... grease.

379
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:46,400
Like a kid...playing, all covered...in mud...having so much...fun...

380
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,500
I loved you... like that...

381
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,530
What is it with all of you?!

382
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,790
What do you want me to do?!

383
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:12,110
How do you expect me to go on living?!

384
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,620
Beats me.

385
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,760
Just live a long life, maybe?

386
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,380
[If you see this face, call the police!!]

387
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,230
Looks like you failed.

388
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,500
We had unexpected interference.

389
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,880
I thought he lost his fangs a long time ago, but, boy, was I wrong!

390
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,410
When it's to protect something, everyone bares their fangs.

391
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,980
You, who have nothing to protect, are nothing more than a beast, Takasugi.

392
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,070
I'm fine being a beast.

393
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,100
I have nothing to protect, nor do I need one.

394
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,530
I will simply destroy everything until the beast in me stops whining.

395
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,000
Hey, smelly priest!

396
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,810
I'm not a smelly priest. I'm Katsura.

397
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,580
What're you doing? You broke it.

398
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,040
This is a wind-up toy?

399
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,010
Hey, stop touching that!

400
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:18,350
Buy it already. I'm saying buy it! It's fun! Just buy it!

401
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,380
He looks pretty happy.

The Masked Loincloth Bandit?

404
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,800
He wears a red loincloth on his head

405
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,430
and steals pretty girls' underwear to distribute to unpopular guys!
