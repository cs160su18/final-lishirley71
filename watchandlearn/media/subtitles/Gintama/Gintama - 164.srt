Why do I have to wander around town
to the point where I'm starving?

3

Stupid Kagura...

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,540
How can you let a growing girl go three
days on less than four pints of rice?!

5
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,520
Why don't we have any work?

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,680
We wouldn't have to go hungry
if you worked every day!

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,030
Go find work right now!

8
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,880
I won't let you inside the house
until you've found a job!

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,940
Easy for you to say.

10
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,940
We're in a global recession, you know.

11
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,180
It's not my fault that I can't find any work.

12
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,140
And she eats way too much.

13

Hey, Gin-san!

14
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,160
It's you.

15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,850
Man, that's pretty impressive.

16
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,290
Like you can pull it off when
you put your mind to it?

17
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,110
Huh?

18
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,380
To be honest, I'm in a tight
situation right now.

19
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,520
So how about it?

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,080
Give me a little assistance or charity?

21
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,940
Huh?

22
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,060
Stop trying to dodge the question!

23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,810
You don't have to act like you're all that

24
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,120
because you're raking it in, Gin-san!

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,150
Huh?!

26
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,720
What are you even talking about?

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,960
When did I start raking it in?!

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,550
Don't play dumb!

29
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,980
I was at Hello Work when
I heard the crazy rumors!

Odd Jobs is red-hot!

32
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,970
They're talking about how you're
fast, cheap, and nice!

33
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,670
And cool to boot!

34
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:48,980
What?!

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,670
What's this?

Who are these people?!

41
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,350
What's with their similar name?!

42
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,730
What is this?!

43
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,800
They're interfering with our business!

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,700
It's their fault that I've eaten less than
four pints of rice over the past week!

45
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,610
Still...

46
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,740
They're more popular,

47
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,150
so we can't really do anything about it.

48
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,430
Is it okay for the original
to lose to the copycat?!

49
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,300
At this rate, they'll be considered
the real ones!

50
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,890
We'll be buried in the annals of history!

51

Are you okay with that?!

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,060
Isn't that how history works?

53
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,650
These days, nobody cares about
where something originated.

54
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,150
What are you talking about?!

55
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,310
We cannot accept such dark history!

use this particular incarnation of Odd Jobs.

60
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,610
They look kinda cool.

A sudden job led to a
surprising encounter.

Can't reveal the name, but
it was someone famous.

87

were determined to accept the job.

to meet this person.

suddenly for that previous job.

Our Odd Jobs range from cleaning
gutters to looking for lost kittens.

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,690
Or helping old ladies with their shopping.

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,520
No. Most people wouldn't
know how to do that.

162
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,150
Get me some tea, big guy.

163
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,390
Huh?

164
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm telling you to get me some tea!

165
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,950
This place doesn't provide its
guests with any service?

166
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,080
Ah, right away.

167
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,380
Who is that?

168
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,370
["People Who Die Stay Dead"]

169
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,720
What's that?

170
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,400
Some high school girls said you
were gross and disgusting?

171
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,850
No, it wasn't that bad.

172
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,940
They were just laughing at me...

173
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,780
Though on second thought, it could
have been in a good way.

174
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,820
Like, "Oh, He's so cute! Whee!"

175
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,220
Are you a moron?

176
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,160
A moron?

177
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,190
Like hell that would happen.

178
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,230
Keep your eyes wide open
and look straight ahead.

179
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,010
In what universe would any high school girls
laugh at you in such a romantic way?

180
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,290
You're deluding yourself.

181
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,650
Gross! Disgusting! Four-eyes!

182
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,160
Why do I have to be insulted
for my glasses?

183
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,090
Uh, can I ask something?

184
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,250
What's up?

185
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,890
Who are you?

186
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,430
Me?

187
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,380
I'm a robot from the future.

188
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,470
A robot?!

189
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,060
You're going to have a sad and sorry future
at this rate, so I came to help ya.

190
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,400
I'll ask just because I have a feeling the conversation
would end if I just accepted that,

191
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,440
but what does this sad
and sorry future entail?

192
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,370
A sad and sorry future would
be sad and sorry.

193
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,950
Yeah...

194
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,820
You're wearing glasses, which means
your eyes are bad, right?

195
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,330
Well, yeah...

196
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,510
Plus, you don't know how to be
considerate and fail at sports.

197
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,010
Most people with those
circumstances have bad luck.

198
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,920
No looks, no brains, no luck.

199
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,740
Sad and sorry enough as
it is, but if it gets worse...

200
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,720
I can't bear to tell you.

201
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,150
So one of your descendants
ordered me to help you out.

202
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,880
Which is why I'm here when
I didn't really want to come.

203
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,830
By the way, big guy.

204
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,850
You're not being considerate enough.

205
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,680
What do you mean?

206
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,740
This right here!

207
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,790
I ask for some tea and
that's all you bring?

208
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,330
You're supposed to offer a snack, too.

209
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,470
Yeah, you know what I mean?

210
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,690
The one with red bean sandwiched between
two spongy pancake-like things?

211
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,310
In any case,

212
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,520
[Note: Dorayaki is Doraemon's favorite food.]

213
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,520
bring me some damn dorayaki!

214
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,770
Ah, he said it.

215
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,910
Here you are.

216
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,120
This is what I'm talking about!

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,480
U-Uh...

218
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,920
What's up?

219
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,210
If I have descendants...

220
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,370
That would mean I got married
and had kids, right?

221
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,260
So...

222
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,810
Who do I marry?

223
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,480
Oh, knew it! Knew it! Knew it!

224
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,140
I knew you'd be asking me that.

225
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,460
I knew it was coming.

226
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,340
Big guy's a real...dirty...man.

227
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,710
Man, I can't get over how young people
these days don't have any patience.

228
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,920
Look here.

229
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,250
It'd be simple for me to
give you the answer.

230
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,180
But you know what?

231
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,410
That would make you give
up on thinking for yourself.

232
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,240
You okay with that?

233
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,250
Aren't you just saying that
because you don't know?

234
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,920
Looks like I'll have to explain
this to you, big guy.

235
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,410
E-Explain what?

236
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,400
Under normal circumstances,

237
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,160
you would hesitate and wonder about
whether you really liked that girl.

238
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,200
A man betters himself through the effort of
establishing and maintaining a relationship.

239
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,320
You could even say that love only
lasts because of constant growth.

240
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,730
If I give you the answer now,

241
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,950
you'll believe that you can marry
that girl without doing anything.

242
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,710
And then you'll just lounge
around your entire life

243
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,620
without putting in any effort or
taking any risks, dumbass.

244
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,560
Which is why I won't tell you.

245
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,020
I'm not being mean.

246
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,980
[Note: Parody of Doraemon. "Neko" means "cat".]

247
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,980
Forgive me, Nekoemon-san.

248
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,600
Who are you calling Nekoemon?!

249
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,070
Huh?! Didn't you come from
the future to help me out?

250
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,620
People even treat me like
a Buddha or a god.

251
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,880
[Note: Parody of Doraemon's fear of mice.]

252
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,920
But I can't stand cats.

253
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,880
I absolutely despise them!

254
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,430
The sound they make gives me shivers.

255
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,920
Look here.

256
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,060
These ears were bitten by a cat.

257
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,830
[Note: In the story, Doraemon's ears
were bitten off by a mouse.]

258
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,580
Huh? Not by a mouse?!

259
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,830
I said a cat did it!

260
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
Ah, yes!

261
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,650
Sorry.

262
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,550
I thought you were someone who could pull
tools out of the pocket on his stomach.

263
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,550
[Note: Parody of Doraemon. His
pocket is filled with tools.]

264
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,700
Well, it's not that I can't.

265
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,040
Huh? You can?

266
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,720
Of course. Who do you think I am?

267
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,310
I-In that case...

268
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,850
That thing that lets you
fly through the sky!

269
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,850
[Note: Parody of Doraemon's Bamboo Copter.]

270
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,360
[Note: Parody of Doraemon's Anywhere Door.]

271
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,870
Or the door that lets you go anywhere!

272
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,860
Or the flashlight that makes
stuff big or small!

273
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,860
[Note: Parody of Doraemon's Small Light.]

274
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,170
Scary!

275
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,740
I'm scared, Mommy!

276
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,320
This person scares me!

277
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,830
He'll fly through the sky to
peek on women bathing.

278
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,830
Once he can go anywhere, he'll
sneak into a girls' locker room.

279
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,490
He'll become small so he can
slide down a girl's cleavage.

280
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,130
Ah! I'm scared!

281
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,260
This person's an animal!

282
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,470
A sex-craved beast! A sex beast!

283
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
Why can you only come up
with criminal actions?!

284
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,900
Huh?

285
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,360
Isn't that all there is?

286
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,540
No!

287
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,240
I would use them to improve myself!

288
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,320
Well, if that's the case, I
guess I'll bring them out.

289
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,680
Bamboo-wing!

290
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,680
[Note: Parody of Doraemon's Bamboo Copter]

291
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,900
Go-anywhere sliding door!

292
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,900
[Note: Parody of Doraemon's Anywhere Door.]

293
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,150
Big and small light!

294
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,150
[Note: Parody of Doraemon's Small Light.]

295
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,380
Uh.

296
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,640
This is it?

297
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,000
Such a weak response!

298
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,860
So you think these look weak?

299
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,010
You probably think they're just toys.

300
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,290
Well, kinda...

301
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,850
You'll be surprised when I use them.

302
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,970
Really?

303
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,500
Give it a try if you don't believe me.

304
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,130
How are you supposed to use this?

305
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,580
Just open it.

306
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,360
Like this?

307
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,920
Isn't this just a door with a piece
of paper on the other side?!

308
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,420
Yeah, switch the paper and you
can see anywhere you want.

309
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,560
Huh?!

310
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,110
And it's too small to go through!

311
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,170
Man, you just don't stop complaining.

312
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,940
You should learn to be satisfied
with what you have.

313
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,140
How am I supposed to be satisfied by
something a child could have made?!

314
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,750
What are you doing?!

315
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,080
This is probably just a flashlight.

316
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,140
W-Wait, hold on.

317
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,100
There's a reason for this.

318
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,330
Eh?

319
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,130
Please! Just listen to me!

320
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,870
Please!

321
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,530
You see, this is still a work-in-progress.

322
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,710
A prototype.

323
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,190
I'll bring a working one later
so just use this for now.

324
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,260
Well, it carries out the function
of lighting up dark places.

325
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,700
Right? Right?

326
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,300
Very useful! Super useful!

327
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,570
Just think about it.

328
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,480
It's the middle of the night and you're
going to buy one of those

329
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,410
[Note: In Japan, racy magazines are
often sold in vending machines.]

330
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,380
magazines you don't want other
people to know about.

331
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:12,630
The flashlight helps you find the money you
dropped so you can buy the magazine.

332
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,180
Could you stop treating me
like I'm in middle school?!

333
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,600
I feel like an idiot for expecting anything.

334
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,310
What are you saying?!

335
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,170
Here! This is amazing!

336
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,220
It's the real thing!

337
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,410
You can fly if you stick this on your head!

338
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,990
Really?

339
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,250
Don't you mean that it can fly when
it's not attached to anything else?

340
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,720
No way. It's the real deal.

341
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,410
You can actually fly.

342
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,960
I just have to put this on my head, right?

343
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,830
Yeah...

344
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,240
It's just...that...

345
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,260
Don't say I didn't warn you.

346
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,140
Hey.

347
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,730
Uh, don't you have one that goes
vertically instead of horizontally?

348
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,430
Oh, that.

349
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,230
I actually brought one.

350
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,240
Bamboo-wing: Vertical!

351
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,130
Oh. You have one.

352
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,810
But I wouldn't recommend using it.

353
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,650
Ah, not again.

354
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,460
That old timer gave me another
defective model.

355
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,840
So yeah...

356
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,830
This shows that you shouldn't
rely on tools.

357
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,840
Isn't that great, big guy?

358
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,070
You've learned something.

359
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,200
So what exactly are you
going to do to help me?

360
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,690
Big guy...

361
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,680
You can't rely on others.

362
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,730
If you rely on me and my tools from the start,
your future won't change a lick..

363
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,270
You see, big guy...

364
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,750
I'm essentially supposed to be with you.

365
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,660
I might bring out a tool to help you every
once in a while or listen to you complain.

366
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,680
But for the most part, I don't
intend to do anything.

367
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,230
Got it?

368
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,870
Kids are no longer curious
or adventurous

369
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,840
because of the dragon that brings dead people
back to life if you collect seven balls

370
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,840
[Note: Refers to Dragon Ball.]

371
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,840
and the robot cat who pulls out tools
when someone goes crying for help.

372
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,150
Uh?

373
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,680
Did you just deny your own existence?

374
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,100
I'm no cat.

375
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,060
And that's not the issue here.

376
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,990
People haven't realized this yet,

377
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,440
but the robot did more good when
he was by the kid's side

378
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,690
than when he was using tools
to solve his problems.

379
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,740
It wasn't a parent, sibling, or pet.

380
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,190
But it was someone the kid could talk
to about anything, like a friend.

381
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,970
It was important to have someone who could
accept all his flaws and weaknesses.

382
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,050
Do you have someone like that, big guy?

383
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,550
Right?

384
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,310
But you don't need to worry.

385
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,390
You and I are friends now.

386
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,150
Okay?

387
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,390
Yes.

388
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,340
So let's start by switching
that TV to a digital one.

389
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,660
Oh, that.

390
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,320
Are they really going to switch
on July 24, 2011?

391
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,260
Well, in the end...

392
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,450
What's wrong?

393
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,290
Not good.

394
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,950
We'll be overheard by Skynet.

395
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,950
[Note: Parody of Terminator]

396
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,860
Skynet?

397
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,690
Don't you mean the Time Patrol?

398
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,690
[Note: Refers to Time Patrol from Doraemon.]

399
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,250
You see...

400
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,280
Skynet is this computer developed
by the military.

401
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,760
But at one point, it determined
that humans were its enemy.

402
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,910
That was the beginning of a long
war between robots and humans.

403
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,430
Uh, I don't see where this is going.

404
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,950
Didn't I explain this in the beginning?

405
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,130
I came from the future because
people were worried about you.

406
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,660
I can use tools to protect you.

407
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,180
But that's all.

408
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,660
Uh, yeah...

409
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,690
I'm pretty sharp.

410
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,070
Lucky you, Connor!

411
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,070
[Note: Parody of Terminator]

412
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,390
Huh?

413
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,080
Connor?

414
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,080
Connor!

415
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,910
Connor?

416
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,150
Aren't you...Connor?

417
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,920
I'm Shinpachi Shimura.

418
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,310
Sorry, I got the wrong guy.

419
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,270
Huh? What...?

420
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,930
The next episode...

421
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,980
"If It Works Once, It'll Work
Over And Over Again."
