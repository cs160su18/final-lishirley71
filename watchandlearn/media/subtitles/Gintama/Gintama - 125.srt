5
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,860
Well, it looks like the GinTama anime
is finally entering its final chapter.

6
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,810
I never expected this to happen
in the middle of the third year.

7
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,150
Lately, JUMP anime just drag on
and on, and when they end,

8
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,800
[Note: Refers to D. Grayman,
which ended like that.]

9
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,800
it's like "Our battle has only just begun."

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,310
D. [bleep]man was just like that.

11
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,240
Well, It's unfortunate that the
GinTama anime is ending,

12
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,560
but let's do our best until the very end!

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,630
All right!

14
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,750
So how long do we have?

15
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,250
Huh?

16
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,020
How many episodes is the final chapter?
When is the final episode?

17
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,770
Oh, well...

18
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,310
What? It hasn't been decided yet?

19
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,320
What? What's the big idea?

20
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,270
Well, how should I put this? Umm...

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,810
the final episode is...in about
half a year from now.

22
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,700
What?!

23
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,150
We're half a year from the final episode?!
How long is this final chapter?!

24
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,490
That's enough for about two seasons
of a late night anime!

25
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,490
[Note: Three months is the usual length
for one season of late night anime.]

26
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,310
Is it that the type of thing they've
been pulling in TV dramas lately-

27
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,840
that scam, where they keep saying
they're going to end?

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,180
When you look at the TV schedule, you
think it's going to be the final episode.

29
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,370
But when you watch it, it's
not the final episode at all.

30
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,010
It's the first half of the last chapter,

31
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,570
or the second part of the final chapter,

32
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,200
or the conclusion of the final chapter.

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,720
Is it that ploy where it keeps
dragging on and on?

34
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,820
Well, umm, that's right...

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,460
The third year of this anime
is getting kind of dull,

36
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,980
so I thought we should
get a little enthusiastic.

37
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,910
Aww... I don't feel like doing
anything anymore.

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,190
You said it was the final chapter,
so I was getting excited.

39
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,310
Hey, you two...

40
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,490
Let's end for today.

41
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,520
Yeah.

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,410
What? No way!

43
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,880
Anyway, GinTama is over for today.

44
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,140
See you next week, uh-huh.

should I do?

47

Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What should
I write in a l-l-letter?!

48
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,810
What are you getting all flustered
about, Shinpachi?

49
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,930
Just leave this to me!

50
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,750
The next episode... "Some Things Can Only
Be Conveyed Through the Written Word."

51

Next is the King Kong twosome. Thanks.

52
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,390
[NOTE: King Kong is a Japanese
standup comedy team.]

53
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,640
H-Hey!

54
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,330
It's only been six and a half
minutes since we started!

55
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,750
Shut up. We've already done the
ending credits and the preview.

56
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,760
We can call it a day, can't we?

57
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,590
If we end here, it'll be dead air!

58
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,320
No, we've shown only this background since
we started. It's already like dead air.

59
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,690
Still...

60
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,250
Anyway, GinTama is over for today.

61
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,680
Everyone, we won't do anything
even if you keep watching!

62
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,270
Next is the King Kong twosome. Thanks.

63
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,390
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is bad.
Our superiors will be furious.

64
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,830
They're already mad at us
for a lot of other things.

65
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,580
The producer has already written
several apologies this year.

66
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,460
Mu-san was moved to a different
department, too.

67
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,460
[Note: Mu-san is now the producer
of an Ad agency.]

68
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,290
We can just write another apology.

69
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,080
We can't do that.

70
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,760
If I say it's over, it's over.

71
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,750
After this, watch [bleep]
until Konkon Hills starts.

72
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,750
[Note: Bleep covers Nintama Rantaro, a ninja anime for
little kids. Kinkon Hills is a Japanese variety show.]

73
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,720
Next is the King Kong twosome. Thanks.

74
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,810
I'm sorry! This is my fault!

75
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,760
Let's do this properly.
Okay? Okay? Okay?

76
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,500
Oh well. Let's fill up the time.

77
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,240
Phew...

78
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,290
Thank goodness.

79
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,220
But I don't feel like doing
anything anymore.

80
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,350
For times like this, we'll do that thing
with that thing like we always do.

81
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,440
Oh. If we do that thing with that
thing, they'll all do that thing.

82
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,340
I-I feel a sense of déjà vu...

83
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,710
Anyway, we're going to
a commercial break.

84
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,060
We'll be dragging on like this even
after the commercial break.

85
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,270
Anyway, we could have ended the episode
with thirty minutes of only that background,

86
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,570
but we were told we couldn't do that.

87
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,560
So we're going to make due
with a mish-mash recap.

88
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,870
All right, Shinpachi, you can start us off
by looking back on the GinTama anime.

89
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,650
Well, if you're talking about GinTama, there's
one episode that you've got to mention.

90
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,040
Back then, I...

91
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,250
The land of samurai. The
time when our country...

92
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,190
Hey! Why do you have to start
all the way back there?!

93
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,830
Well, this is the fateful episode
where we met.

94
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,860
Last year's recap episode
started from there!

95
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,270
We don't need that.

96
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,550
Let's go to my first appearance, next...

97
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,780
We already did that, too!

98
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,540
Reminisce about other things!

99
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,570
But when I try to look back on GinTama
and take a look at the list of titles...

100
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,850
["Nobody With Naturally Wavy
Hair Can Be That Bad"]

101
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,140
["You Only Gotta Wash Under Your
Armpits, Just the Armpits"]

102
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,380
It's difficult to remember anything
because a lot of the titles

103
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,470
["Watch Out for Conveyor Belts"]

104
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,790
make it impossible to tell what
the episode was about.

105
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,810
["You Know What Happens if You Pee on a Worm"]

106
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,100
["Do Cherries Come from Cherry Trees?"]

107
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,690
That's right.

108
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,390
["A Dog's Paws Smell Fragrant"]

109
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,530
The episode I first appeared in was

110
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,680
["The Manga Writer Becomes a Pro.
After Doing a Stock of Manuscripts"]

111
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,660
"Watch Out! Weekly Shonen Jump Sometimes
Comes Out on Saturdays!"

112
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,560
["Watch Out! Weekly Shonen Jump Sometimes
Comes Out on Saturdays!"]

113
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,090
What's that supposed to mean?

114
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,680
Oh, I think that's just being considerate.

115
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,060
Oh well. Then let's decide
on a theme and reminisce.

116
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,270
For example: Gin-san's
top ten touching lines,

117
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,850
or the top ten battles where
Gin-san looked cool.

118
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,970
Wait, why are they all
about you, Gin-san?

119
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,000
Then why don't we do the top
ten episodes that received

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,860
the most complaints from the viewers?

121
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,270
We can't do that!

122
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,240
Oh yeah. Why don't we say that we're going
to reveal all of the unaired scenes

123
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,000
and air them without the bleeps?

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,780
In that case, we should remove
the scrambled parts, too.

125
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,270
We'll be immediately cancelled!

126
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,250
Anyway, it's difficult to make
a recap about GinTama

127
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,140
because there isn't a continuous storyline and
the main character doesn't have a goal.

128
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:32,220
[Note: Parody of Dragon Ball and ONE PIECE.]

129
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,320
For example, searching for seven
balls that grant wishes,

130
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,220
or trying to become the pirate king...

131
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,030
We did that a month ago.

132
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,430
Oh...

133
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,910
Don't say "Oh." What are we going
to do? This is not even a recap.

134
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,590
If we don't cut it out, management
will be furious again.

135
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,270
Really?!

136
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,470
I'm serious. This time, they're going
to haul another person away.

137
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,180
What?!

138
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,970
This is an official police bust!!

139
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,830
What's your problem?

140
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,600
Prince of Planet Mayo Maniac,
why are you here, mayo?

141
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,810
We got word there was a suspicious secret
discussion going on here, mayo...

142
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,470
I didn't mean to say "mayo"! What
in the world were you doing?!

143
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,560
If you don't confess, I'll haul you in!

144
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,130
I won't tell you, mayo!

145
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,960
Anyway, who do you think you are, barging
into someone's house, mayo?!

146
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,330
Stop with the "mayo"!

147
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,510
So what were you all
talking about, mayo?

148
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,460
Well, the GinTama anime is finally
entering its final chapter,

149
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,340
so we thought we'd drum up some interest
by looking back on our past episodes.

150
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,060
Tsk. Is that all? A recap episode, huh?

151
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,800
Don't say, "Is that all?"

152
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,520
We need it to help keep GinTama going
for the remaining six months.

153

There are lots of things
we need to preserve.

With all the Amanto in the world now,

164

even the hero of the Amanto
war is just another criminal.

165
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,940
It takes real guts to still be fighting
the Amanto these days.

166
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,270
Hey, Okita, wake up.

167
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,780
I'm surprised that you could sleep
through that explosion.

168
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,660
Explosion? Did you let the
terrorists attack again?

169

You need to apply yourself.

They can blow up all the
Amanto for all I care.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,980
I'll let those fishies swim for a bit before I'll
reel 'em in, line 'em up and cut their necks.

173
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,380
It'll be a proud moment for the Shinsengumi.
I'm looking forward to this fight.

on Kondo-san next?

No, we don't really need to
look back on Kondo-san.

a part down the middle, what would you do?

as the egg is cooked, it's an omelet.

No, it's not. This isn't an omelet.
It's an innocent, abused egg.

Maybe you should talk
to the town magistrate.

uses for cherry blossom
viewing every year.

I don't mind if we sit on

Shut up!! I actually couldn't
care less either.

to move because of this jerk!

to save our spot, didn't we?

us, then bring a bulldozer.

Oh that's rich...talking back to
the bakufu government, eh?

285

It looks like we'll be watching blood
swirl, instead of cherry blossoms.

286
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,350
It looks like we're destined
to do this every year.

287
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,950

for what you did last time!

Let me explain. In Mallet and
Helmet rock paper scissors...

297
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,720
You play one round of
rock paper scissors...

The winner gets to hit the loser.

299

The loser is safe if he blocks
it with his helmet,

300
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,680
but the winner wins the
game if he gets a hit in.

301

Anyway, it's something like that.
It's a wild and aggressive game.

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,900
Umm... This challenge
will be decided by...

306
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,140
three representatives from each side.

307
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:31,180
To be fair, Shinpachi-kun and I, Yamazaki,
will be the judges.

308
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,050
The winner wins the right to view cherry
blossoms from here and gets Otae-san.

309
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,850
What kind of rules are those?!
What are you, kidnappers?!

310
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,810
We don't gain anything
by winning or losing.

311
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,440
Then we'll give you a Shinsengumi sausage.

312
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,470
It was in the headquarters' refrigerator.

313
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,390
In other words, it's just an ordinary
sausage! We don't need that!!

314
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,190
A sausage, he says. Let's go for it.

315
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,920
All right.

316
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,060
Idiots!! You guys are total idiots!!

317
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,430
[Round One:
Chief Kondo vs Otae-san]

318
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,430
Let's begin the first round!
Chief Kondo versus Otae!

319
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,720
Sis, don't push yourself.
I'll take your place.

320
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,430
No, there's no honor in this
unless I do it myself.

321
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,700
That man keeps popping up no matter
how many times I crush him.

322
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,350
I'm sick of it...

323
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,180
I'm going to end to it right here and now.

324
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,680
This is bad. That look in her eyes...

325
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,950
Well then...

326
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,000
Get ready to play...

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,680
Rock, paper...

328
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,670
Scissors!!

329
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,720
Whew, I'm safe!!

330
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,970
You're not safe! Run away, Kondo-san!

331
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,850
Huh?

332
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,280
Spirits of heaven and hell,
give me strength!

333
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,310
Huh? Huh?

334
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
Use me as an instrument
of divine judgment!!

335
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,810
Hey, Otae-san, I already
have the helmet on...

336
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,100
That's not in...the rules.

337
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,100
[That's not in...the rules]

338
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,040
Chief!

339
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,560
What the hell did you
do, you evil wench?!

340
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,850
Oh... So you want to fight, too?

341
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,830
We're very sorry.

342
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,450
Shinpachi-kun, you have
it rough, don't you?

343
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,130
I'm used to it.

344
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,630
Umm... The Chief is unable to continue,

345
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,300
so the first round is a draw.

346
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,550
For the second round,

347
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,910
both contestants please try to
at least follow the rules...

348
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,490
Whoa!

349
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,490
They've already started!

350
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,460
They're fast!! They're super fast!!

351
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,660
They're so fast it looks like they both
have a hammer and a helmet.

352
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,100
Oh? She's evenly matched
against Sogo?

353
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,320
Who is that girl?

354
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,590
Sogo's got no brains,

355
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,560
but he's got the strongest sword
arm in the Shinsengumi.

356
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,170
Evenly matched?

357
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,880
You think a human can
stand up to Kagura?

358
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,960
She's a member of the nearly
extinct race of warriors,

359
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,560
the Yato clan. She's amazing.

360
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,250
What? Well, our Sogo...

361
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,440
Well, our Kagura...

362
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,270
Hey, knock it off!

363
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,290
You sound ridiculous-like little kids
bragging "my daddy is a pilot"!!

364
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,890
Never mind that. Did you guys
start drinking already?!

365
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,460
Huh? Our round started already.
Okay, next up tequila.

366
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,820
Bring it on.

367
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,120
Man, they're in their own world
with that drinking contest.

368
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,640
Wow. The battle on this side
has become ever fiercer.

369
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,640
Huh? Wait a minute...

370
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,750
Both of them are clearly
wearing a helmet.

371
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,010
And they don't have hammers.

372
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,930
They're not even playing
rock paper scissors.

373
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,310
They're just beating the
crap out of each other!!

374
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,010
I told you to follow the rules!!

375
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,170
This is so out of control.

376
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,260
Oh well. We have to decide
this with the final showdown.

377
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,720
Gin-sa...

378
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,590
Hey! What are you doing?
You two can't fight like this!

379
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,260
Don't worry. I can still do
this. Let's settle this...

380
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,790
Bring it on, damn it!

381
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,250
It would be boring to settle
things normally.

382
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,030
Why don't we play some
"Cut and Parry-style

383
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,140
rock-paper scissors" using real swords?

384
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,680
Bring it on, damn it!

385
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,580
"Bring it on" is all you've been saying.

386
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,120
I feel weird asking you this,
but are you all right?

387
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,280
Bring it on, damn it!!

388
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,390
Yamazaki, give him a sword!!

389
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,980
Huh?

390
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,850
Sure! Sure!

391
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,640
You shouldn't have given him a sword.

392
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
Huh?! But...

393
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,050
Let's do this!

394
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,720
Bring it on, damn it!

395
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,860
Ready?

396
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,600
Cut and parry-style rock paper...

397
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,270
Scissors!!

398
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,970
I win!!

399
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,380
Don't worry. I used the back of my sword.

400
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,970
Well, I hope you've learned your
lesson-don't mess with me.

401
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,390
Hey you! You throw "rock" every time!

402
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,610
Are you trying to make a fool of me?!

403
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,110
What's wrong? You aren't
saying anything.

404
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,310
Are you trying to make
a fool of me, huh?!

405
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,800
We both have pretty strange bosses.

406
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,310
Yeah...

407
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,470
Father, cherry blossoms are really best
when viewed with a large group.

408
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,330
This is the most fun I've had
viewing cherry blossoms

409
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,150
since you passed away.

410
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,170
Come on, Shin-chan...

411
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,700
Oh, that's umm...

412
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,970
Huh? Where am I?

413
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,230
And so, we managed to fill
up thirty minutes of time.

414
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,110
Well, it really was just a recap episode.

415
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,090
Will the producer have to
write another apology?

416
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,600
[Note: Bleep covers Code Geass.]

417
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,600
It's all right. This happens
a lot with [bleep] as well.

418
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,230
It's Sunrise's usual problematic pattern.

419
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,550
Well, anyway, we'll finally be entering
the final chapter next week!

420
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,960
We still have half a year, so let's not
exert ourselves and drag it on.

421
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,240
We might extend into our fourth year!

422
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,520
That won't happen.

423
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,850
Oh, we forgot the cast credits.

424
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,060
[So anyway, we'd like to drag
on until the final episode.]

425
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:40,100
[Also, we won't be doing these crappy
recaps or whatever anymore.]
