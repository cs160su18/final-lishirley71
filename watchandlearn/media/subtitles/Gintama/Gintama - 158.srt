This is just a dog.

You're a funny guy, Mako-chan.

There's somebody in this thing, right?

51

Yeah, I was joking when I agreed to this yesterday.

What do I do here?

53

I can't do anything about this.

As you all know, Toshi was born after I laid my hands on the demon sword.

he attempted to separate from me as a separate personality

114
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,650
and sealed himself deep inside.

Wait, Mr. Hijikata!

117
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,330
He would probably disappear eventually.

118

That's what I thought.

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,550
But I kept waiting and he never disappeared.

120
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,330
He's still waiting with sharp eyes to take over my body when given the chance.

he's still part of my personality.

I didn't refuse the fight.

138
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,450
I chose to face him head-on and talk.

"I don't want to disappear without accomplishing anything.

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,300
Hand over? She was never yours to begin with.

165
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,870
I'm starting to repeat myself, but this is just a little fan club dispute.

166
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,130
That's what I thought you would say.

167
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,930
It appears that this battle was inevitable.

168
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,520
It's the fan club's duty to protect the princess to the very end.

169
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,190
Stop my conquest if you can!

170
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,660
Let's finish this, Hijikata-san!

171
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,560
I'll be the one to become the Tsu Terakado Official Fan Club!

172
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,800
Everybody!

173
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,220
Do you like Otsu?!

174
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,810
We love you!

175
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,930
You love me lots?!

176
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,310
We love you lots and lots!

177
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,770
You love me lots and lots and lots?!

178
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,380
We love you lots and lots and lots and lots!

179
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,680
A TV Mix-and-Match Special!

180
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,060
The pianist battle to decide Tsu Terakado's official fan club!

181
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,410
Okay, so we're on our way.

182
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,340
What do you think, Otsu-chan?

183
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,600
Impressive showing, right?

184
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,010
Five thousand fans gathered here for you!

185
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,970
Wow! Amazing!

186
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,200
Everybody!

187
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,990
Thank you! Suicide dive!

188
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,520
This is after we narrowed the numbers down significantly.

189
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,530
So from the five thousand people gathered here today,

190
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,230
in other words, from the 1,250 teams of four,

191
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,630
only one team will be chosen.

192
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,000
Only four of the five thousand people here will be able

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,010
to win the honor of becoming members of Otsu-chan's official fan club.

194
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,970
Well, this will be a difficult wall to climb.

195
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,380
How excited is everyone here?

196
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,000
Do you want to become Otsu-chan's official fan club?!

197
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,610
Are you willing to put up with any ordeal for the sake

198
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,650
of becoming Otsu-chan's official fan club?!

199
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,430
Are you willing to go anywhere for Otsu-chan, whether it's into fire or into water?!

200
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,930
Would you be able to eat Otsu-chan's ****?!

201
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,970
Wh-What's wrong with those people?!

202
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,700
How can they say that stuff on a live broadcast?!

203
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,180
They still managed to beep it just fine.

204
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,860
Somebody!

205
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,140
Get rid of those people!

206
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,780
Commercial! Cut to a commercial!

207
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,490
OEDO Record.

208
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,580
Tsu Terakado's long awaited single is on sale now!

209
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,980
Okay.

210
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,210
This is a pain, so let's go right to the final challenge.

211
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,240
We're going to distribute some of Otsu-chan's **** right now.

212
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,780
The team who finishes eating first wins.

213
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,260
Whenever you're ready!

214
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,810
What kind of challenge is that?!

215
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,090
And how much **** do you think Otsu-chan can put out?!

216
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,420
Stop ridiculing Otsu-chan!

217
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,920
Otsu-chan doesn't **** or fart!

218
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,960
Get lost scum!

219
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,090
You're the ones who should get lost, brats.

220
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,020
When you love a person,

221
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,780
that means you also love the dirty stuff about her.

222
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:35,100
When you pretend she doesn't **** and ignore the dirty stuff, you're out of the question.

223
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,120
Get out of here, cherry boys.

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,160
Our boss here boasts that he can down eight whole plates.

225
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,350
You people won't be able to beat our Tsu Terakado Fan Club in this lifetime.

226
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,600
Uh, could you stop making stuff up?

227
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,830
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club?

228
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,920
They're the legendary...

229
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,820
Impossible.

230
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,190
I heard they were destroyed by a rising new force.

231
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,980
I didn't expect them to still be around!

232
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,430
This isn't funny!

233
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,210
I came because I figured I had a chance, since they were gone!

234
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,540
Eight plates isn't humanly possible!

235
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,080
I was expecting one plate at most, which just shows he's on a whole different level.

236
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,700
I'm the first one out!

237
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,920
Second!

238
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,500
Oh, this is a surprising scene.

239
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,830
The appearance of the Tsu Terakado Fan Club has led to teams giving up one after another!

240
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,140
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club is a fearsome force!

241
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,120
What are you doing?!

242
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,140
Get down here!

243
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,870
Overwhelming other teams without even fighting!

244
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,520
A good portion of the teams have taken flight after that scat talk!

245
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,900
Gin-san, I appreciate this.

246
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,610
You understand, right?

247
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,370
I don't care about the membership cards.

248
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,180
The reward money is all mine.

249
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,800
What are you talking about?

250
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,640
The reward money's mine.

251
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,810
That's why I listened to Otsu-chan's songs over and over until I could sing them from memory.

252
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,360
Your big brother's a hi-

253
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,630
Are you stupid? Dying?

254
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,720
This isn't a singing contest.

255
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,980
Hey...

256
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,590
Shin-chan, are these people really going to work?

257
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,210
Uh, cut the chatter.

258
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,490
Tsu Terakado Fan Club,

259
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,310
if you pull something like this again, you'll be immediately disqualified.

260
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,470
Well, we had an unexpected disruption, but please calm down, everybody.

261
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,010
Otsu-chan, are you okay?

262
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,430
U-Um...

263
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,560
Yes.

264
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,410
Sorry about embarrassing you like that.

265
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,740
But everybody who stayed is able to eat Otsu-chan's ****, so you don't have to worry.

266
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,190
Stop talking about ****, MC!

267
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,940
I apologize.

268
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,470
We've lost quite a few teams, but we'll carry on as planned.

269
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,960
The people who already left would never have survived till the end.

270
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
Understood, everybody?

271
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,230
I'll explain the prelims so listen carefully.

272
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,510
We have approximately one thousand teams of four people here,

273
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:07,610
but only four teams will make it to the final selection!

274
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,180
Only four teams out of a thousand?!

275
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,450
A fierce battle right off the bat?!

276
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,730
Only those who truly love Otsu-chan can win the honor of being Otsu-chan's Official Fan Club!

277
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,460
However, there is no way to measure love!

278
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,740
In that case, you'll have to show me your love!

279
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,990
You call yourself a hyooooo-man?

280
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:33,260
Use your knowledge, stamina, and everything else you have to reach your beloved Otsu-chan!

281
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,200
What planet is your maaaa-ma fr-

282
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,720
The prelims will be a test of...

283
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,220
Stamina!

284
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,060
Otsu-chan will now take a helicopter to OEDO TV.

285
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,440
It's over there.

286
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,640
We have a ten kilometer course from the riverbed to OEDO TV.

287
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,480
You'll have to run it.

288
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,080
The first four people to reach Otsu-chan...

289
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,280
The teams those people belong to will earn the right to proceed to the final contest!

290
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,000
In other words, it doesn't matter if you have a slow ass on your team.

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,390
As long as one member ranks in the top four, your team proceeds!

292
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,880
But don't forget this:

293
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,800
If anybody on the team gives up, that team is immediately disqualified!

294
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,000
Everybody!

295
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,860
Come quick!

296
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,950
I'll be waiting!

297
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,180
Then, is everybody ready?!

298
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,030
Huh? We're already starting? Already starting?

299
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,420
Ready...

300
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,980
Set!

301
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,030
Go fish!

302
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,600
Why do otaku have such a hard time understanding how to use their bodies?

303
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,420
If they sprint at the very beginning, they're not going to last ten kilometers.

304
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,010
You'll always find people who race off at the beginning and drop off later on like Yamcha.

305
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,010
[Note: Yamcha is a character from Dragon Ball.]

306
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,170
Shin-chan, let's run together.

307
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,220
Let's cross the line together.

308
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,750
Kagura, you take care of the rest.

309
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,870
I'm gonna take it easy.

310
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,690
Woo-hoo!

311
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,130
The money's mine!

312
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,650
Fifty-fifty, fool.

313
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,670
Yahoo!

314
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,580
Buddy, this is so easy that I can feel mushrooms growing out of my belly button.

315
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,510
Stop, you're killing me.

316
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,670
[Note: Parody of TV series from the 90s, "Ai to iu nano motoni" (In the name of love).]

317
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,730
So easy that...

318
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,670
the Hideo Nakao in my belly button was tricked by a Filipino woman and almost killed himself.

319
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,470
Stop, you're killing me.

320
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,310
And that joke is ancient.

321
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,920
How can we possibly lose to a bunch of flabby otaku with their bellies hanging out?

322
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,950
There wasn't any need for me to participate.

323
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,170
That may apply to the otaku...

324
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,230
What is it?

325
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,930
Are you worried about something?

326
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,180
Well, I can't find Hijikata-san.

327
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,780
What? You're still worried about him?

328
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,340
Why isn't he around?

329
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,160
Well, I suppose it'd be hard to spot him in this huge crowd.

330
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,840
There's no need to worry.

331
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,780
It's possible that after all that big talk, he failed to finish the paperwork.

332
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,290
Whatever.

333
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,150
Anyway, I'm tired, so I'll take a sedan to the TV station.

334
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,680
I'll be rolling around in prize money, so I might as well start splurging now.

335
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,350
Hey, sedan!

336
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,660
Hey!

337
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,610
How lazy are you?!

338
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,550
You can't!

339
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,310
Didn't they say that any team that has a member who gives up would be disqualified?!

340
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,470
Refusing to run is the same as giving up!

341
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,940
It'll be fine.

342
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,350
[Note: Parody of "24 Hour TV Love Saves the Earth". A popular section of this show has charity marathons run by celebrities.]

343
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,400
I heard that ***** ********* was riding in a car when the cameras weren't on her on the 24-hour TV show.

344
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,660
And you've even got people who air pre-recorded stuff.

345
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,510
This isn't pre-recorded!

346
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,960
We'll lose the prize money and official membership cards!

347
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,100
Hey, cut it out already.

348
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,660
We're betting our fan club's existence here.

349
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,050
I'll beat the crap out of you if you don't shape up!

350
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,520
Let me go, stupid brat.

351
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,370
You want me to smash your best facial feature, those protruding teeth?

352
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,510
Like hell they're my best feature!

353
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,610
I obviously harbor a complex about that!

354
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,590
Bite your tongue.

355
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,580
People use their complexes as a way to mature.

356
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,890
You try to become better when you feel inferior.

357
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,380
So you could consider it a good feature in a way.

358
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,420
I'm gonna snap that great feature of yours.

359
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,360
Do it!

360
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,180
Snap them and make me handsome!

361
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,430
Stop it, Takachin!

362
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,640
Snapping them won't make you handsome!

363
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,500
That's not the issue here!

364
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,420
Damn it...

365
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,930
What's the issue-

366
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,130
Takachin!

367
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,130
Takachin, get a grip! Takachin!

368
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,490
They snapped...

369
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,160
How do they look...?

370
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,980
That's not the issue here!

371
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,510
What's the issue...?

372
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,070
Ah, he looks okay so carry on.

373
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,770
I see.

374
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,910
Uh, you're headed to the TV station, right?

375
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,880
Yes, OEDO TV.

376
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,720
Takachin!

377
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,350
Hey, somebody we obviously know was wearing a rather familiar lame costume

378
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,210
and headed to a place we just heard about in a taxi.

379
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,840
Huh?!

380
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,930
This isn't the time for that!

381
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,130
We have to take Takachin to the ER!

382
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,630
If anybody on the team gives up, that team is immediately disqualified!

383
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,410
Takachin...

384
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,810
The E-E-E-E-E-

385
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,520
His hair is bouncing back and forth. E-R, E-R.

386
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,950
Yeah, it sure is.

387
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,160
O-Okay.

388
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,720
We don't have time for this, Takachin.

389
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,920
L-Let's go.

390
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,090
H-Hey, walk properly.

391
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,790
Takachin, what's wrong?

392
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,110
That's why I told you not to drink so much.

393
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,600
Okay, we'll get you another round.

394
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,030
At the TV station bar.

395
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,450
H-His eyes are rolling back in his head.

396
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,030
Rolling back in his head!

397
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,070
He's obviously had too much to drink.

398
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,060
M-Maybe we should go to the E-

399
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,920
His hair's going E-R, E-R.

400
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,700
It sure is.

401
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,830
Uh, yeah.

402
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,780
Huh?

403
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,670
What are you doing, master?

404
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,910
[To Be Continued]

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:15,340
[Preview]

406
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,340
How long will you continue to struggle, members of the Tsu Terakado Fan Club?

407
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,840
When the other teams are all my pawns...

408
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,760
The next episode...

409
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,550
"If One Orange in the Box is Rotten, the Rest of Them Will Become Rotten Before You Know It!"

410
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,690
[With all the traps laid before them, the Tsu Terakado Fan Club is in danger of dropping out.]

411
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,900
[But the strongest help of all appears! And that person's name is...]

412
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,270
[See you next time.]
