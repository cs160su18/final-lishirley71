00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,400
Keep the room well-lit and watch from a distance, okay?

3
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,810
[Today's "Gin Tama" is a two-parter! Part One's guest stars are Michael and Marilyn.]

4
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,080
[Part Two's guests are those black shiny things! Sit back and enjoy the show.]

5
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,500
Who's there...?

6
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,350
My name is Gankeimaru.

7
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,480
If you wish to live, drop the sword you are wearing and leave.

8
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,460
I see...

9
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,570
So you are the ogre who has been hunting swords and causing a public disturbance.

10
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,290
Very well.

11
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,410
If you want this sword so badly, then come and take it...

12
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,810
by force!

13
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
Die!

14
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,720
That was too easy.

15
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,260
The only impressive thing about you is the sword you carry, eh?

16
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,530
This is far from the strongest sword I've found...

17
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,740
I heard there is a samurai's blade that can cut a star...

18
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,740
but it seems coming to Earth was a big waste of time.

19
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,960
Where is it, I wonder... The enchanted sword, "Star Destroyer"?

20
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,250
["Don't Panic-There's a Return Policy!"]

21
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,070
Ouch! My god!

22
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,160
Long hours as a manga artist have turned my stomach into a double cheeseburger!

23
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,520
Jennifer's going to hate me if I look like this!

24
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,180
What's the matter, Michael?

25
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,980
Did a fountain pen pierce your biceps and make them explode?

26
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,700
No! Look, Marilyn, at my stomach!

27
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,280
You need to be careful. Fountain pens are sharp enough to kill people.

28
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,320
I said this isn't about a fountain pens, stupid woman! It's my stomach!

29
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,060
Don't worry!

30
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,330
Use this: the "Round-and-Around Fat Burner"!

31
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,170
Use this for just two hours every day, and your stomach fat will completely disappear.

32
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,190
Are you serious, Marilyn?!

33
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,330
Act now and but two colors and we'll throw in the red one for free!

34
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,860
Just pay in 12 monthly installments, and you'll achieve the body of your dreams!

35
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,440
Say goodbye to this double cheeseburger! Yahoo!

36
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,700
Yahoo!

37
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,920
"Yahoo" nothing. Where did you get that?

38
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,680
I called that number and they gave it to me.

39
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,850
They gave me this, and this, and this, and this, too. Yahoo!

40
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,910
Good god!

41
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,200
Kagura-chan, this is called a shopping channel. It's a TV show where people buy things.

42
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,560
Those things weren't free; you bought them.

43
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,740
Seriously?

44
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,420
Anyway, return them immediately.

45
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,500
There's still time if you do it right now.

46
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,150
Hey, hey, that's harsh, Johnny!

47
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,750
Who're you calling Johnny?!

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,750
Shinpachi, give me a hand. We're returning all of this.

49
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,110
Right.

50
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,660
Stop right there!

51
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,940
Johnny, Maxwell!

52
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,580
This is so unfair, dammit!

53
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,560
Don't you care if I end up with a double cheeseburger?!

54
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,340
Stupid Gin-chan!

55
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,160
Adults don't know anything!

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,780
Hmm...this isn't it, either...

57
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,450
Hey! What're you doing?!

58
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,970
What're you doing walking around with a bunch of swords when there's a sword ban?

59
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,700
That's not good...

60
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,240
A fine's a fine. And the fine is million yen, at least.

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,030
Since there are three of us, that's three million.

62
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,790
What a filthy wooden sword!

63
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,290
Smells like curry, too? You're asking me to buy this from you?

64
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,500
Yes. I want to buy stuff from the Shopping Channel.

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,120
I don't quite understand, but I can't buy this from you.

66
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,800
I am willing to buy that odd creature from you, though.

67
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,780
Damn you... Do you realize we're Bakufu officials...?

68
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,800
Phew! It reeks of curry!

69
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,080
And it says "Lake Toya"-this is a souvenir, isn't it? I don't want it.

70
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,850
Surrender!

71
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,680
The sword... Where is the sword...?

72
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,220
I don't eat Earth foods. I don't like the taste. Especially curry.

73
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,620
What? A wooden sword?

74
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,740
If it belonged to a handsome guy, I might buy it, with a few conditions,

75
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,310
but I have no interest in something of yours, young lady.

76
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,970
Why won't anyone buy this good-for-nothing stick from me?!

77
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,280
Useless thing!

78
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,920
I don't even get a real salary!

79
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,350
How am I supposed to buy the things I want?!

80
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:50,250
Last month, I got paid in pickled seaweed! How sour a wage can somebody get?!

81
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,720
H-Hey! The bridge!

82
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,870
Am I supposed to spend my youth with just pickled seaweed?!

83
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,120
This isn't it...or this...

84
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,000
A monster!

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,520
What is that wooden sword?! The bridge is gone!

86
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,010
Wooden sword?

87
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,630
Can't even go home if I want to.

88
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,380
I took his precious sword without his permission.

89
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,510
Gin-chan's going to be angry for sure.

90
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,880
Who are you?

91
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,110
Young lady. Where did you get that wooden sword?

92
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,410
The way it cut a bridge in two...

93
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,920
I've found it at last...the enchanted sword...

94
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,370
Star Destroyer!

95
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,300
Quietly hand over that sword! If you don't, I'll take your life!

96
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,260
Now you've done it, young lady!

97
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,630
Huh? "Sword Collecting"?

98
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,140
That's right. There seems to be a lot of attacks around town...

99
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,780
The culprit is apparently an Amanto training to become the strongest warrior in the universe.

100
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,260
He's apparently really strong.

101
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,420
Seems many Bakufu retainers and ronin have already fallen to him.

102
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,040
Wasn't that his work we just saw?

103
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,760
The strongest in the universe, you say?

104
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,070
We may come from different planets, but the stupid things men do don't change.

105
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,020
Is he pursuing a dream or something?

106
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,330
All of these guys read too much JUMP.

107
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,530
He might come after your wooden sword, too, Gin-san.

108
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,020
That wooden sword is much more powerful than an ordinary metal one.

109
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,710
It can cut through anything.

110
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,540
What on earth is that sword?

111
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,330
It is, well...

112
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,150
When I was on a school field trip to Lake Toya, a hermit who lived there...

113
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,170
Huh?

114
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,860
What? Now that you mention it, what'd I do with it?

115
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,260
Who was that guy?

116
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,790
We'll hide here for a while, Sada...

117
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,710
Found you, young lady.

118
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,250
Hey! Look what you've done!

119
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,190
And you, too! Pay up!

120
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,030
That guy will pay!

121
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,490
You're not getting away!

122
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,340
I've seen many swords up until now, but your sword...

123
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,890
is the enchanted sword I have been searching for all these years. The Star Destroyer!

124
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,150
Don't get so excited, sword freak.

125
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,530
You underestimated me.

126
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,300
I held back and was soft for not killing you, young lady?

127
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,770
But we of the Genbu Clan have bodies so tough that even bullets bounce off us.

128
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,140
With this body and the Star Destroyer, no one can stand against me.

129
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,800
The strongest sword should be wielded by the strongest warrior.

130
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
Now, admit defeat and hand it over.

131
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,260
Oh, this must be my punishment for bad karma.

132
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,800
It's because I stole someone's cherished possession.

133
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,490
So now, God is punishing me.

134
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,740
But please listen, God... He didn't pay me a real salary.

135
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,290
And he took away all my cool crap.

136
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,750
Maybe I should hand over this wooden sword and make it easy on myself.

137
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,230
No, wait. If I did that, then I would be exactly like him.

138
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,950
At his age, it's impossible for Gin-chan to change his character.

139
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,010
But Kagura... There's still time for you.

140
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,570
Grow up! Kagura!

141
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,480
Dammit! What have you done?

142
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,200
What?!

143
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,010
Good boy, good boy. Well done, Sadaharu.

144
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,680
Let's go home and apologize. Though, I'm still a little mad.

145
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,280
This sword looks best on Gin-chan's belt, after all.

146
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,650
I'm home!

147
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,400
Ouch! My god!

148
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,410
I can't believe I'm being threatened by samurai!

149
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,100
Today's my date with Jennifer. What rotten luck. Shit!

150
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,160
Jennifer's not coming. You're going to die here, Michael.

151
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,070
Hey. What're you doing here?! Nobody said anything about this.

152
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,840
The other day, when you were drinking, I heard you call me "Frankenstein"!

153
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,720
I've only had a nose job, you bastard!

154
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,450
I'm going to take this enchanted sword "Star Destroyer"

155
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,050
and cut off your ripping muscles so hard you'll never recover.

156
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:54,320
This was fashioned from a 10,000 year-old Diamond tree that only grows on a distant planet!

157
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,560
This amazing wooden sword can cut through rock, meteors and even your muscles.

158
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,800

166

[Expert on space creatures, Prince Hata]

Yes. They are indeed cockroaches, but they are probably not from Earth.

206
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,880
They most likely entered Edo aboard an alien ship that came to Earth.

207

So they are alien cockroaches?

208

No, I wasn't. What are your thoughts, Prince?

246
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,170
They are carnivorous, so I would advise caution.

Don't be silly.

262
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,250
It's just a huge cockroach. It wouldn't.

263

264
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,060
Spit him out, damn bug!

265
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,410
What'd he taste like?! Like corn potato? Or salted cod roe?!

266
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,950
Oh? It's crying. What a baby!

267
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,010
If crying solved everything, we wouldn't need police, idiot!

268
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,820
Seriously, what should we do with this thing?

269
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,770
I repeat. Even if you find them, do not kill the cockroaches.

270

If you do so, it will call its brethren to its aid!

271

Under no circumstances, are you to attempt to kill it!

272
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,570
However, Idiot Prince, that means there is no way to combat the cockroaches.

273
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,190
Hey, you clearly just said "idiot."

274

Announcer Ketsuno!

278
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,870
Yes, I am now in Kabukicho, Shinjuku, where the monster cockroaches have caused the greatest damage.

279
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,330
Just look at this disaster.

280
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,290
The cockroaches, which appeared suddenly and reproduced abnormally,

281
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,760
are currently attacking all of Edo.

282
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,970
What will become of Edo from here on?

283
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,470
Is there a reason why the cockroaches are concentrated in Kabukicho?

284
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,190
Prince... Idiot Prince?

285
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,130
Why'd you say that?! You could've just continued on your way!

286
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,620
I'm definitely going to kill you all later!

287
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,840
No... I won't have to dirty my hands. You'll eventually die.

288
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,690
Listen to me.

289
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,990
The reason they're gathering there is probably because the queen is there too.

290
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,200
They are all siblings born from a single female.

291
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,180
First, the queen builds her nest on a planet and lays a large cache of eggs.

292
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,980
The hatchlings eat their way through the entire planet.

293
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,410
In this manner, they have destroyed several planets.

294
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,460
As long as the queen exists, they will continue to multiply.

295
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,980
At this rate, it will most certainly be the end of this planet.

296
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,970
So the only way to save ourselves is to exterminate the queen?

297
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,720
Is that what you're saying, Idiot?

298
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,750
Add "Prince"! If you're going to call me an idiot, at least add the "Prince" title!

299
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,120
Is there any way to tell the queen from the others?

300
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,470
Nope. Their queen is identical to an ordinary cockroach.

301
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,130
No, wait. There is one thing different about it.

302
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,010
What could that be?

303
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,700
She has the characters for "Goro" written on her back.

304
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,170
What? What does "Goro" mean?

305
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,860
It's just the name I gave her.

306
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,210
That Goro, running away from her cage on her own after I took such good care of her.

307
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,780
What did you just say?

308
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,440
What? Did I say something I shouldn't have? Uh...

309
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,820
[Please Stand By.]

310
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,900
They say it has "Goro" written on its back.

311
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,750
Who cares? We're done for. It's the end of Earth.

312
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,660
You're making too much noise! Keep it down, up there, you nimrods!

If I knew this was going to happen, I should've been nicer to cockroaches!

316
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,220
Hey! Kagura, this is no time to be sleeping.

317
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:03,850
Three cockroaches. Four cockroaches. Five cockroaches.

318
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,980
Kagura-chan?!

319
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,210
Don't fall asleep counting cockroaches!

320
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,850
You'll have a nightmare about being locked up in a sticky, slimy room!

321
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,540
Hey, snap out of it!

322
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,860
"Goro" on its back. Got it?  "Goro" on its back!

323
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:15,190
If a cockroach with "Goro" on its back is exterminated, the other cockroaches will die off.

324
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,190
Please. The fate of the Earth is at stake.

325
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,700
The fate of Earth is in your hands!

326
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,440
What's this? Why's it say "Goro"?

327
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,700
That's really weird. As if this thing isn't creepy enough already.

328
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,710
But under these conditions...

329
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,870
You're a lucky fellow. Saved by a spider's...er, roach's...thread.

330
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,510
This damn well better be worth some good karma.

331
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,160
Gin-san! I, Shinpachi have returned!

332
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,790
Shinpachi! You're alive!

333
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,600
You actually thought I could be killed by a cockroach.

334
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
I bought an ultra-powerful bug spray.

335
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,050
I guess that karma stuff works.

336
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,280
Gin-san!

337
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,540
All right. It pays to do good deeds.

338
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,590
These things are everywhere!! The city is going crazy!

339
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,650
There are pickled seaweed cockroaches crawling all over the streets.

340
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,060
We're in trouble. If they find out it was our fault, they'll chop our heads off.

341
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,470
There is a strange rumor going around.

342
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,690
Something about these being man-eating cockroaches that came from space to take over Earth.

343
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:21,000
And the world is doomed unless we kill the queen cockroach, with "Goro" written on its back.

344
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,650
Man, people will believe anything!

345
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,400
Shinpachi-kun...say that again.

346
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,080
Like I said, these are man-eating cockroaches,

347
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,440
and unless we kill the queen roach that has "Goro" written on its back, Earth is doomed.

348
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,170
Is that stupid or what?!

349
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,910
Sure is stupid...

350
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,120
Stupid, like being the man who destroyed the world.

351
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,920
What else can I do but laugh...

352
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,620
You've seen it? You saw Goro?!

353
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,280
I had it in my hand and I let it go.

354
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,400
I've doomed Earth.

355
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,370
Wh-Wh-Where?! We have to find it right away.

356
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,660
It's no use. It ran off somewhere.

357
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,670
Forget it. Let's go eat steak.

358
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,170
Okay, Kagura, you can eat all you want today.

359
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,960
After all, we're all going to die, anyway.

360
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,390
Wait, Gin-san, pull yourself together!

361
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,790
It's as though I've condemned us all to death. Kill me now.

362
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,110
Gin-san!

363
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:22,140
[Preview]

364
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,620
Excuse me?

365
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,460
May I say something?

366
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,990
I think the culprit is a pauper.

367
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,130
So I think...

368
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,390
What's going on?

369
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,130
What's next week's story about?

370
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,180
The next episode: "Even Teen Idols Act Like You Guys."

371
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,080
[How a live street performance touched the heart of a young man about to self-destruct.]

372
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:40,090
[A young girl's singing gave this young man a reason to live.]
