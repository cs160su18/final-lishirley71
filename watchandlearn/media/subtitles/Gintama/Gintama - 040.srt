No way!

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,090

[The hit movie now playing in Edo. Even that man cried emotional tears.]

16

Why’s it have to be just before quitting time?

17
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,410
Seems something alien attached itself to the fuselage during the flight.

18
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,400
Huh? You’re not suggesting an alien or something is stuck to it…?

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,990
Which reminds me. Did you see “Alien vs. Yakuza”? Man, it was awesome…

20
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,930
I haven’t seen the series since “Alien 2.”

21
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,060
Really, it’s not that good, is it?

22
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,780
No, you’ve got to see it.

23
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,010
The latest one’s awesome!

24
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,260
There’s this army of aliens, right, and they fight a bunch of Jo Bro clones…

25
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,840
…and no matter which side wins, only death awaits them in Edo!

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,080
Why’s that? Why’s Edo going to be destroyed because of Jo Bro?

27
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,860
You know what? I was actually more afraid of Jo Bro.

28
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,440
That so? Then let’s hope it’s not Jo Bro that’s stuck to the fuselage.

29
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,460
It’s for real!

You guys mechanics?

36
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,620
There’s a good chance that monster’s main body has escaped into Edo.

37

Edo’s in big trouble.

38

Would you tell the police for me?

39

Is that you, Gin-chan?

00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,760
That’s right. It’s Gin-chan… Gin-chan.

47
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,290
I got into an accident and hit a pregnant woman. I’m in deep trouble.

49

What?! How could you say that? That’s awful!

50
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,890
Anyway, I need money. If you don’t hurry, I’ll be arrested.

51
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,300
Seriously?

52

[Note: In Japanese, the word “deposit” sounds similar to the term that means “throwing rice.”]

53

I need you to immediately deposit the money to this bank account…

54
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,050
That hurt. I wiped too hard.

Man, we’ve got to get a bidet.

56

Huh? Did somebody just leave?

57
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,590
Yeah. That was Kagura-chan.

58
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,710
She went rushing out in a panic after taking a call.

59
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,820
What’s that about?

60
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,090
Must’ve been a call from her home. Maybe they want her to return.

61
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,250
That’d be great. It’d be a lot quieter around here.

62
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,770
More importantly…

63
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,790
Gin-san, you gotta check this out.

64
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,540
The “It’s Me” con artist?

65
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,250
It’s a new scam where the con artist calls on the phone without saying their name,

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,090
just saying “It’s me” and letting you assume it’s someone you know.

67
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,520
Then they say they’re in trouble and need you to wire money to them.

68
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,790
I wouldn’t deposit money no matter who was in trouble.

69
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,680
Remember that, Shinpachi.

70
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,150
The only one who’d fall for that is some stupid girl with Amazonian strength.

71

Umibozu? What’s that?

72
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,230
You don’t know, Okita-san? Everybody knows.

73
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,990
Let me see that.

A space exterminator who hunts and eradicates the most dangerous aliens in the galaxy.

78
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,100
He’s celebrated as the strongest of all the exterminators.

79
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,220
He has secret ties with planetary authorities everywhere.

80
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,220
He’s a man who has traveled the stars and battled countless monsters.

81
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,000
He’s known only as “Umibozu”… He’s a living legend.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Ohh… So what’s a legend doing here?

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,740
Seems an alien escaped into Edo.

84

85

We will handle it from here, so please rest assured.

However, I never thought I would meet the Umibozu. I am honored.

87

Are you here on Earth to hunt aliens?

88
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,760
You say that like I’m hunting mushrooms!

89
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,300
I’m here on private business.

90
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,610
I’m pursuing someone much more troublesome than any alien.

91
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,980
Someone who troubles even the famed Umibozu-dono?

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,510
A woman, I take it.

93
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,240
She is indeed a woman. No question about that.

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,320
I’m sorry. Gin-chan told me on the phone! He’ll get in trouble if I don’t “throw rice!”

97
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,120
Huh? Throw rice?

Miss, Miss…

99
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,200
You don’t throw rice. Don’t you mean “deposit”?

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,570
Anyway, I have to do this!

101
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,330
No, you must be referring to “deposit”!

Don’t bother me, four eyes!

We have to act quickly or we’ll have a major problem.

Jo Bro, we love you!!

118

I don’t entirely understand… but listen carefully.

119
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,740
This alien can take over any organism—a dog, a cat— anything as its host.

120
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,310
Its intelligence is low, but its adaptability makes it deadly!

121
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,580
The quickest way to tell if someone’s been taken over by it is to look at their face. There will be bruises.

122
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,820
Look for a panda! The parasite’s host…

123
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,930
will have black circles around their eyes.

124
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,600
Understand, men? Look for a panda! We must…

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,940
stop it before it causes any damage. Look for a panda!

126
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,800
Not like…a real panda…you know.

127

I’m at the Oedo Bank & Trust, where a robber has barricaded himself inside.

We can see the robber’s face! What are those dark circles around his eyes?

129
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,690
He must be sleep deprived!

This is a message for the robber!

133
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,910
You are completely surrounded.

Come out peacefully.

135

We’re too late.

136
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,420
What? You don’t mean that Kagura-chan did this?

137
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,340
Kagura is responsible?

138
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:50,080
That’s right. She was tricked by the “It’s Me” scam and tried to deposit money.

139
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,490
But, of course, she doesn’t have any money. And that’s what led to this violent act.

140
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,820
Oh no… What should we do?

141
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,140
What can we do?

142
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,150
Gin-san?

143
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,560
This is a message for the robber…

144
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,880
Hey, what’re you people doing?!

145
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,390
I don’t think I can beat her, but if I don’t try to stop her, who will?

146
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,410
If her family were here, they’d do the same.

147
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,220
G-Gin-san…

148
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,530
I’m in too.

149
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,720
It’s too dangerous!

150
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,280

151
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,120

152
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,180
A monster!

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,890
Well… I’m glad… seems Kagura-chan isn’t the robber.

154
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,390
Yes, you’re right.

155
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,720
But wasn’t something attacking her?

156
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,580
That must’ve been, you know, her father.

157
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,790
That call must’ve been from her father. They were meeting here.

158
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,160
Oh, so that was her father giving her a big hug.

159
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,470
They want time alone, just father and daughter. We really shouldn’t disturb their reunion…

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,040
Gin-chan, that’s cruel. Why didn’t you rescue me?

161
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,380
What’re you doing? What’s that all over you?! Is that your father’s guts!

162
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,570
I threw a lot of rice for you, Gin-chan.

163
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,320
What happened to the priest? Did you settle it?

[Note: A play on the word ninpu meaning pregnant woman and shinpu meaning priest]

165

What’s this about a priest? How did that guy scam you?!

166
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,820
What is that?

167
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,710
Is that your dad?

168
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,450
That’s not my dad!! It just appeared and started spewing all over the place.

169
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,060
It’s still spewing!

170

Let go! Let go!!

171

Bad Kagura-chan! Let go of us!

172

I’m taking both of you with me!

173
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,680
Oh, found you.

174
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,640
Hey, that umbrella…

I’d rather die than break my principles!

181
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,770
I was totally moved.

182
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,150
Jo Bro is the best!

183
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,370
Yes, I cried. It was the best.

184

Aliens are scum!

[Now playing]

190

Hey, Otsune. A man talks with his back.

00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,030
Testing, testing.

192
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,510
This is a message for the alien.

193

You are completely surrounded.

194

Give up this pointless resistance and come out peacefully, alien.

195

Your mother back in your hometown is crying!

196

She didn’t raise you to be this kind of alien.

What kind of alien is that?

It doesn’t matter if you’re an alien or human,

199
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,150
anyone who makes his mother cry is a loser. Right, mother?

[Note: "bozu" means priest, and is slang for bald.]

227

He’s not bald, but his hair is thinning.

228

Hey, what do you mean by “thinning”?

229
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,540
I’m just thin on top.

230
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,230
Umibozu is the fiercest Alien Buster ever.

231
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,520
His name is known throughout galaxy. The wandering exterminator.

232
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,150
Oh, yeah, yeah, I’ve heard of him. The balding janitor.

233
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,510
It’s “buster”, not "janitor"!

What do you mean, hopeless?

240
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,000
And this guy with the stupid fuzzy-head is Gin-chan.

241

What’s with the stupid?

You talking about grating a radish on your head?

248

A father who abandoned his daughter has no right to talk.

249
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,500
I’ve been hunting feverishly for her ever since

250
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,900
I took my eyes off her for a second and she disappeared.

251
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,220
Girls this age are difficult. They’re as fragile as a glass sculpture.

252
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,600
What’re you talking about? Your brain is as fragile as a glass sculpture!

253
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,960
You talk big, with your big hair.

254
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,930
But, when you pass thirty, it’ll happen so quickly.

255
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,120
Before you know it, the follicle goddess will abandon you too!

256
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,120
Come on, stop that, you two!

257
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,190
At any rate, I can’t leave my daughter in the hands of someone like you.

I’m taking Kagura-chan home with me!

You don’t get to decide that!

260
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,600
Kagura-chan, there’s no excuse for domestic violence!

261
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,950
Pappy, you ignored your family and did whatever you pleased.

262
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,140
I don’t want you meddling in my life now.

263
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,790
I don’t interfere in your life…so don’t interfere in mine!

264
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,120
I came to Earth on my own. I’ll go home on my own.

265
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,980
Kagura-chan…

266
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,730
Family is like a bird’s nest.

267
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,250
A bird can’t keep on flying forever.

268
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,140
If there’s no nest to go home to, she’ll eventually fall to the ground.

269
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,800
Pappy, you’re a migratory bird. You don’t need a nest.

270
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,400
I’m the same way. I don’t need a nest; a wooden perch is enough.

271
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,480
Then what’s so special about this wooden perch?

272
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,940
Is there something that you can only get here?

273
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,680
What would I gain by going back home?

274
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,350
I’ll perch wherever I like and fly from there.

275
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,990
Kid! Don’t talk like you know it all.

276
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,450
You still think I’m a kid…Baldy?

277
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,090
Huh? What is this feeling?

278
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,190
Hey, they’re going to…

279
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,200
Kagura-chan!

280
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,760
All right, carefully move it outside.

281
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,550
Hijikata-san, what’re we going to use this nasty corpse for?

282
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,010
The Immigration officers said to bring it in.

283
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,840
Some VIP wants it, they said.

284
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,290
You’d think he could find something better to collect…

285
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,810
Is this the kind of monster Umibozu always fights?

286
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,970
Makes me wonder which one is the real monster.

287
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:07,060
And to think he’s that China girl’s father! Not exactly the family type.

288
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,150
There are two kinds of men.

289
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,130
One is the protective type who seeks to protect his home and family.

290
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,780
The other is the hunter type who leaves that home in search of prey.

291
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,340
In that man's eyes, I see the hunter.

292
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,480
But even more… I see a beast. He’s not the type that can stay peacefully at home.

293
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,300
I’m afraid that girl has lived a lonely life until now…

294
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,050
What’s that?!

295
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,080
What are they? Are they even human?!

296
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,180
Do you think I’d allow my unmarried daughter

297
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,240
to live with a man?!

298
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,680
That’s how you get

299
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,600
a marriage forced by pregnancy!

300
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,310
I’m not a loose woman!

301
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,460
And anyway, isn’t that how you married mommy?!

302
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,940
That bitch! She told you that?!

303
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,690
You’ve got no right to preach, Pappy!

304
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,850
I do!

305
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,330
I won’t let you make the same mistake I did!

306
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,890
Leave me alone already!

307
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,950
That’s all you’ve ever done anyway!!

308
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,770
So I’ll decide for myself where and how I’ll live!

309
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,410
Seems you really like this wooden perch.

310
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,120
Then all the more reason you should leave it.

311
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,880
Have you forgotten the beast blood that runs through our veins?

312
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,780
The Yato instinct that makes us roam in search of prey?

313
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,150
We are just beasts that can only live on the battlefield.

314
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,260
What happens when you put that beast in a peaceful place?

315
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,840
You forget who you are…

316
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,760
become self-destructive, hurt yourself…

317
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,390
Stay here, and you’ll snap this wooden perch in half.

318
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,050
If you love this place, then leave it.

319
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,370
If you don’t want to come home, then come with me.

320
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:29,010
This isn’t the place for you. This isn’t the sky we should fly in.

321
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,040
No. I don’t want to live a life where I just give up.

322
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,760
I’m going to change here. I know if I stay here, I can change.

323
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,420
I’ll stay with Gin-chan and the others.

324
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,630
Gin-chan? That guy? What can a bum like him do?

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,770
You leave me no choice…

326
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,470
Then I’ll take you with me by force.

327
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,570
Gin-chan!

328
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,560
Mommy!

329
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,590
What is it with you people?!

330
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,850
Gin-chan, I…

331
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,760
What do you think you’re doing?

332
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,590
Don’t be sticking your nose into a family argument.

333
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,300
That was another wild fight.

334
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,560
You and your daughter are a pair! Like father like daughter, huh?

335
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,170
Go home.

336
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,480
The Earth’s too small for you, after all.

337
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,420
I think we can all see that now. Go home with your father.

338
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,720
Let’s make this good-bye.

339
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,390
What? Why? Why are you saying that?

340
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:56,330
I’m never going back… I’ll stay…forever…with you and the others…

341
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,970
Wait…

342
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,180
Stop it!

343
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,660
Think about it. This isn’t where you belong, is it?

344
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,420
Why…?

345
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,260
Why…?

346
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,770
Why…?

347
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:05,430
[Preview]

348
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,320
You fired her?! You fired Kagura-chan?!

349
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,690
Does that mean she went home together with her father?!

350
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,430
Gin-san, have you ever thought about Kagura-chan’s feelings?

351
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,900
The next episode: "You Can't Judge a Movie by Its Title."

352
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,290
Third year, class Z, Ginpachi-sensei

353
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,040
[Third Year, Class Z, Ginpachi-sensei!]

354
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,730
Stand! Bow! Take your seats!

355
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,780
For today's lesson, I'd like to explain the difference between “Alien” and “Amanto”.

356
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:31,500
Sensei, I think the spelling for Alien is “Alien” not “Aliyan”.

357
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,020
Shut up, this is more sophisticated and trendy.

358
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,220
In the first place, I don’t want someone who can’t even speak proper Japanese to point that out.

359
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,220
OK everyone, open the brochure for “Alien vs Yakuza”.

360
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,450
Sensei, I have misty eyes and I can’t read this.

361
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,960
Please avenge Jo Bro.

362
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,580
Go to the nurse’s office and get a mayonnaise injection or something.

363
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,490
First of all, Aliens are…

364
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,330
Sensei!

365
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,330
I found out I am really alien.  What should I do?

366
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,820
Go home and have a talk with your mom.

367
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,930
Sensei, I’m hungry. Why don’t we finish this class?

368
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,900
Sensei has decided to have curry for lunch, so no.

369
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,610
What do you mean by that?

370
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,580
It’s okay. There was no meaning from the very beginning.

371
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,550
Okay, “Alien vs Yakuza” is now playing in theaters, so go and watch it, everyone.

372
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,020
Okay.

373
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,430
I’m absolutely going to watch this movie.

374
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,050
