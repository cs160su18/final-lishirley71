It was pretty warm out today.

We're going to hit the rainy season soon.

What are you doing, master?

Well, what a coincidence.

Put me in quite the fix.

55
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,030
He was going on about freeing the Vice-Chief or something,

56
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,100
but how am I supposed to understand what's going on when you put me

57
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,290
in this embarrassing uniform and tell me to run.

58
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,460
Well, it's not that I don't like Otsu-chan or anything,

59
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,630
but I'm not a big enough fan to want to participate in an event like this.

Hey.

61
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,010
Besides, I have no idea how becoming Otsu-chan's official fan club

62
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,950
is going to save the Vice-Chief, yeah?

If the committee finds out about Takachin, we're finished!

We have to cover this up!

71
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,600
That sounds rough.

72
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,610
Well, we happen to be in a hurry so...

Y-Yeah...

78
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,910
You probably let someone else run up ahead so you could relax yourself, right?

79
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,120
You don't need to put on airs.

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,920
We have no choice!

81
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,940
We don't have to worry about what place we're in since Kagura-chan's running up ahead,

82
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,130
but that'll all be for nothing if they find out about Takachin's injury!

83
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,780
We must make it to the finish line without anybody noticing!

84
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,940
Uh, at the moment, a young girl and a large man are in the lead.

85
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,270
Members from the Tsu Terakado Fan Club and the Tsusengumi.

86
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,080
Neither is giving up an inch! This is amazing!

87
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,710
We've got an intense head-to-head race here!

88
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,730
Regardless of which one pulls ahead,

89
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,750
both teams appear assured to make it out of the prelims...

90

Wait, that's wrong!

That's the wrong way!

00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,720
What is this?!

94
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,020
The two lead runners are so intent on their contest that they've gone the wrong way!

95
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,100
Ah, that's wrong!

96
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,480
That's the wrong way!

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,720
They're racing off course at a tremendous speed!

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,520
Their rankings are starting to drop!

99
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,570
From heaven to hell!

100
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,870
This is bad!

101
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,020
The other members of their teams have to do something,

102
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,500
or neither team will make it out of the prelims!

103
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,320
What the hell is she doing?!

104
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,770
What do you mean, the other members have to do something?!

105
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,940
Isn't it a bit late to do anything?!

106
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,780
Are we supposed to catch up while carrying Takachin!

107
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,770
This is the pits!

108
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,820
It was stupid of me to send her up ahead!

109
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,860
Master, master.

110
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,310
Behind you. Behind you.

111
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,670
You've picked up all kinds of junk.

112
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,750
Uh, is that guy okay?

113
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,590
He hasn't moved at all.

114
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,440
Huh?!

115
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,900
Did something happen?

116
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,370
N-Nothing at all!

117
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,770
He's absolutely fine!

118
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,680
He's just tired after running too fast at the beginning!

119
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,160
Yeah, but...

120
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,670
He's got a stray dog biting down really hard on him.

121
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,450
Those are the eyes of a dog hungering for dead flesh.

122
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,500
Is that okay?

123
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,520
Absolutely okay!

124
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,160
He's got a few dogs at his old home!

125
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,880
Maybe dogs just love him?!

126
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,380
Yeah, but...

127
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,600
There's a weird old guy with a scythe bearing down on you.

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,510
Is that okay?

129
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,710
Absolutely okay!

130
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,440
Maybe it's his dad from back home?!

131
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,150
He must have come to cheer him on!

132
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,350
Yeah, but...

133
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,950
There's also an old lady with wings on her back bearing down on you.

134
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,950
Is that okay?

135
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,220
It's his mom!

136
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,710
Both of them came!

137
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,360
What a wonderful family!

138
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,100
Master! He's completely exposed now!

139
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,160
Are you sure he's okay?! Hey!

140
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,710
Absolutely okay!

141
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,680
He may be completely exposed, but we've got a hat covering it so we're okay!

142
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,520
[Note: Gin is hinting that Takachin has phimosis, a physical condition that affects men. Look it up.]

143
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,520
A little sun visor's covering it!

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,270
Gin-san!

145
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,010
This is impossible!

146
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,580
This is impossible to cover up!

147
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,850
Takachin's body won't be able to bear all of this!

148
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,550
And worst of all, he'll be charged with public indecency before we make it out of the prelims!

149
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,460
Damn it...

150
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,090
I have no choice!

151
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,730
Sacrifices must be made at times!

152
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,210
Shinpachi!

153
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,430
I'm counting on you to catch-up!

154
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,120
Gin-san!

155
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
Where are you going?!

156
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,920
I'll take Taka-chin to the hospital for now!

157
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,050
Gin-san, it's no use!

158
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,600
If you take him to a doctor in that condition, he'll be hospitalized in no time!

159
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,390
We won't be able to avoid his disqualification!

160
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,580
I vow to bring him back once he's been looked at!

161
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,430
I promise!

162
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,290
So I'm counting on you in the meantime, Shinpachi!

163
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,860
Gin-san!

164
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,110
That's a clinic for urologic plastic surgery!

165
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,500
What are you having him looked at for?!

166
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,800
It's over, Shinpachi-kun.

167
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,230
He won't be able to make it back in that state.

168
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,480
Well, we'll work hard enough for your share.

169
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,590
Just give up quietly and join the spectators.

170
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,810
I won't give up!

171
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,360
Gin-san promised, so they'll definitely return!

172
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,880
All I can do is believe in them and move on!

173
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,560
Aw, he's all fired up now.

174
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,580
What a waste of effort.

175
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,150
The Tsusengumi's victory is all but...

176
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,070
He's pretty quick.

177
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,240
We might have a chance at this rate.

178
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,100
That was fast!

179
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,640
What? You got a problem with me coming back so fast?

180
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,080
No, wasn't that a little too fast?

181
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,370
Where's that injured guy?

182
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,390
Did you just dump him off somewhere?

183
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,320
No, he said he'd race over as soon as he was done being treated.

184
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,800
You're such a kidder.

185
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,430
What's the point in buying a little time?

186
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,210
He won't be coming back.

187
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,120
Ah, there he is.

188
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,060
Huh?

189
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,490
Hey!

190
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,950
Over here!

191
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,270
Man, it's a good thing it wasn't anything serious.

192
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,330
Besides, you're too weak.

193
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,460
You need to work out more.

194
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,320
Yeah, Taka-tin?

195
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,930
Who is that?!

196
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Who is that?!

197
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,630
Who is this person?!

198
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,310
Isn't this a completely different person?!

199
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,740
Who is this brazen foreigner?!

200
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,470
Huh? What do you say?

201
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,790
It's Taka-tin.

202
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,180
It's obviously Taka-tin and nobody else.

203
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,470
That's true.

204
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,720
No, it's obviously a completely different person!

205
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,210
Look at this guy from any angle and any position and this guy's got nothing on him!

206
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,710
Yep, nothing on him.

207
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,470
Since Taka-tin was just released from surgery.

208
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,950
What kind of surgery?!

209
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,840
I'm talking about his character!

210
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,390
It's not like you ordered the wrong guy here!

211
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,700
And what do you mean, Taka-tin?!

212
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,540
Why are you speaking in English?!

213
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,390
Hey, now.

214
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,480
Don't try to pick a fight here.

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,520
He's the real deal. 100% genuine.

216
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,150
Authentic stuff, yeah.

217
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,690
Lose the crappy English accent! It's pissing me off!

218
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,470
Now, now. Think back.

219
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,130
Taka-tin had that French bread-looking pompadour.

220
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,130
He's just carrying a loaf of French bread in his hand!

221
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,340
You could at least put the bread on his head!

222
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,470
Why is he just standing there?!

223
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,120
Why is he standing there with French bread?!

224
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,400
Well, the treatment being what it was...

225
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,800
A man becomes an adult when he's had the hat down there removed.

226
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,180
He's dropped the sun visor to stand out where everyone can see.

227
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,240
So he's probably trying to act a little more mature.

228
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,200
[Note: Gintoki is taking about a circumcision and the surgical operation used to fix phimosis.]

229
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,640
Like I said! What kind of treatment was it?!

230
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,050
How could he possibly have turned into a huge adult who can't fit into a T-shirt?!

231
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,190
[Note: Turtleneck sweaters are often used in ads as a symbol of phimosis.]

232
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,190
Well, he finally dropped the turtleneck he's had since he was born.

233
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,050
Time is money.

234
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,140
Oh, we don't have time for this.

235
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,150
We need to be on our way.

236
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,980
He just spoke in English.

237
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,910
He's not even trying to pretend to be him!

238
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,250
And he's eating the French bread!

239
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,350
One hour, ten thousand yen.

240
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,420
Two hours, twenty thousand yen.

241
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,690
During that time, I'm Taka-tin.

242
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,620
Okay?

243
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,270
Okay. Okay.

244
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,510
Three hours, three loaves of French bread.

245
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,530
Four hours, four loaves of French bread.

246
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,580
Okay?

247
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,630
Why does his compensation become French bread after three hours?!

248
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,820
It obviously isn't okay!

249
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,600
He's only getting twenty thousand out of this!

250
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,220
Okay! French bread!

251
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,270
You're okay with it?!

252
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,640
Bread over money?!

253
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,730
This is obviously fraud.

254
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,590
He's nothing more than a substitute.

255
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,100
Sorry, but I have to report this to the committee.

256
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,650
Everybody's serious about this!

257
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,820
I can't let this slide!

258
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,580
Ow!

259
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,590
The French bread is hard!

260
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,680
The French bread hurts!

261
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,850
Everybody's serious about this?

262
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,160
Hey, don't give me that bullshit. Hey, now.

263
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:47,060
Want me to tell you how Takachin got injured in the first place? Huh?

264
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,470
The prelims are yielding a whirlwind of events.

265
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,900
Half of the participants are out after being caught up in the rampage of the front two.

266
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,690
And the front two are missing after going the wrong way.

267
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,710
At the moment, the last stragglers from the remaining half

268
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,090
have passed the five kilometer mark where they disappeared.

269
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,230
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club and the Tsusengumi

270
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,700
have clawed their way from the depths of hell in search of victory!

271
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,990
Quite frankly, they have no chance of bouncing back.

272
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,330
Very unfortunate.

273
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,790
Two of the top teams falling in the prelims...

274
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,650
Ah...

275
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,690
That's...

276
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:40,390
The person racing over the countless fallen bodies of otakus at a tremendous speed...

277
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,870
C-Could it be?!

278
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,190
That's... That's...

279
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,230
Here it is!

280
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:54,850
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club has clawed their way from the depths of hell in search of victory!

281
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,510
However, a large gap has opened between the leaders and the stragglers.

282
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,790
It will be very difficult to overcome their lead!

283
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,830
I can't lose here!

284
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,430
I can't let myself lose!

285
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,430
Whoa! He's speeding up!

286
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,870
He's already caught up to the frontrunners and is attempting to pass them!

287
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,700
Formation Genbu.

288
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,950
Oh?

289
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,660
What... What is this?

290
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,640
The frontrunners have abruptly created a formation to block the Tsu Terakado Fan Club's path!

291
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,510
A wall! It's like a wall!

292
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:52,010
A large wall of otaku prevents him from advancing!

293
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,830
What is going on here?

294
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,340
How could all these scattered teams move with such coordination?!

295
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,680
It couldn't be...

296
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,120
What a naive bunch of people...

297
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,800
Between the committee running this contest and your little fan club...

298
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,530
Five thousand participants in this tournament.

299
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:18,920
In other words, over a thousand teams fighting for the title of Official Fan Club...

300
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,180
You still haven't noticed that this contest isn't all fun and games?

301
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,280
A thousand teams versus one.

302
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,070
Five thousand versus four.

303
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,830
The only people in this competition are yours and mine.

304
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:46,190
All of the otaku standing here after entering the tournament are my pawns, excluding your group.

305
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,280
Th-That's impossible...

306
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,630
All of them belong to the Tsusengumi?!

307
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,420
They're all our enemies?!

308
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,550
No way...

309
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,700
It can't be!

310
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,200
How could you have become such a large force...?

311
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,140
The battle was over before it even began.

312
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,700
Yes.

313
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,040
This isn't a contest for becoming the Official Fan Club.

314
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,730
It's merely a ritual.

315
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,390
A little celebration to cleanse Toshi.

316
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,220
And you people are the sacrifices.

317
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,280
Nobody likes sacrifices that don't know when to give up.

318
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,700
You shouldn't be roaring for a fight. You should be accepting your fate.

319
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,990
What's this?!

320
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,590
A member of the Tsusengumi was among the frontrunners!

321
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,260
We were unable to hear the conversation,

322
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:48,460
but it's believed that he's leading multiple teams in working together to block the Tsu Terakado Fan Club!

323
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,630
The waves of otaku are parting like the Ten Commandments!

324
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,340
The Tsusengumi has instantly jumped to the top!

325
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,750
On the other hand, the Tsu Terakado Fan Club...

326
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,730
Oh! The Tsu Terakado Fan Club has charged into the wall!

327
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,520
However, the wall of otaku is preventing him from making a move!

328
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,920
Damn it! Damn it!

329
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,190
I won't give up!

330
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,710
I refuse to give up!

331
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,730
I made a promise with Gin-san!

332
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,610
I'm sure that Gin-san will keep this team alive!

333
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,490
I must keep our hopes alive!

334
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,920
I must find a path...

335
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,660
I don't care how thin it may be.

336
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,890
I will find the ray of light that leads to victory!

337
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,990
We now move to the bridge at the seven kilometer mark of the course.

338
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,530
Only three kilometers to the finish line.

339
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,370
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club remains stuck in dead last!

340
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,690
It will be difficult to change the situation!

341
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,080
Is this the end for their fan club?!

342
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,720
Found it...

343
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,560
The rail of the bridge!

344
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,830
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club

345
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,060
has found a path to victory where none existed, on the thin rail of the bridge!

346
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,360
The other teams are unable to cope with this unexpected development!

347
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:45,310
[Note: Reference to Yoshitsune Minamoto from Heian era. Legend says he dueled legendary warrior monk Benkei on Gojo Bridge.]

348
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,190
Like Yoshitsune, He's gracefully tearing across the bridge!

349
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,310
The otaku are gathering onto the bridge to block the fan club's path!

350
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,310
Will he make it past this wall of bodies?!

351
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,750
Can he surpass his own limits?!

352
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,090
A little more... Just a little more!

353
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,710
This is our last chance!

354
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,200
I'm definitely going to take it!

355
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,890
Victory! Victory for all of us!

356
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,430
Well done, Patsuan.

357
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,530
That's enough.

358
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,760
We'll handle the rest.

359
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,480
Gin-san!

360
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,730
Takachi...

361
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,230
So we're counting on you,

362
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,910
Taka-tin.

363
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,230
French bread!

364
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,990
Huh?

365
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,950
Who is that?

366
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,040
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club has used one of their own as bait to destroy the other teams!

367
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,920
[To Be Continued]

368
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,130
A Little Ginpachi Sensei!

369
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,450
Okay, we have some extra time, so I'll read a few letters.

370
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,940
Uh, a question from pen name Odd Jobs Rule, Shinsengumi...

371
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,800
is okay?

372
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,540
Nice to meet you.

373
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,040
I just noticed something.

374
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,110
Shinpachi is a fan of Otsu.

375
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,770
[Note: Enka is Japanese traditional popular music.]

376
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,500
And Kagura likes enka.

377
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,770
So what kind of music does Gin-san like?

378
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,960
I can't think of anything off the top of my head, so please let me know.

379
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,080
Okay, I'll give you your answer.

380
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,310
Gin-san doesn't listen to music.

381
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,050
He hums a few commercial jingles every now and then.

382
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,300
[Note: Episode #133]

383
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,670
So you remember back when I sang A Thousand Winds?

384
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,990
After that episode aired, the voice actor's mother called to say,

385
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,660
"Tomokazu, do a better job of singing."

386
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,330
[Note: The voice actor is Tomokazu Sugita.]

387
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,480
Sorry, that's how this character is supposed to be.

388
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,910
And on a different note,

389
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,060
Okita probably listens to comic storytellings.

390
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,900
[Note: Japanese comic storytelling (Rakugo) is Japanese verbal entertainment.]

391
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,900
You can imagine him listening to the stuff, right?

392
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,450
Uh, here's another one.

393
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,220
A question from pen name Kaishu Katsu should be in GinTama.

394
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,020
Hello.

395
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,210
Excuse me, I have a question to ask.

396
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,690
While watching the ending credits,

397
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,920
it says that Yuu Saito assisted in the production.

398
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,040
He's the current editor for the manga, right?

399
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,230
When Onishi was the editor, it said that Kohei Onishi assisted in the production.

400
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,540
How exactly do they assist in the production of the GinTama anime?

401
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,680
Please let me know.

402
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,400
Okay, I'll give you your answer.

403
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,030
They don't do anything at all.

404
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,540
Every week, they hold so-called meetings with the anime staff where they drink using their company money.

405
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,390
So Nakasaki, the new editor.

406
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,480
Enjoy the company's money next week.

407
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,620
Who are you?!

408
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,760
Who the hell are you?!

409
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,840
The next episode...

410
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,860
"From a foreigner's perspective, you're the foreigner."

411
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,180
"From an alien's perspective, you're the alien."

412
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,620
Yeah!

413
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,320
So who the hell are you?!

414
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,660
Taka-tin.

415
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,520
[Finally, the main round for the battle to become the Tsu Terakado Official Fan Club begins!!]

416
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,860
[The Fan Club versus the Tsusengumi. They begin with a quiz!]

417
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,230
[See you next time.]
