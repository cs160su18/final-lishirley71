The sky is egalitarian... It doesn't discriminate against anyone.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,760
It shines the light of the sun on everyone equally.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,760
But the skies test us at times.

5

Night comes...

6

the sun becomes obscured by rain or clouds.

There is no rain that does not stop.

As long as the sun shines in our hearts,

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,690
we will never lose our way.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,770
But we did not know at the time

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,830
that the stronger the sun shines,

14

You're a hundred years too early to be stealing my wallet.

Your work is sloppy.

32

When it comes to stealing, when you stick your hands into someone else's kimono...

important things also fall out of your kimono.

What kind of adult are you?!

43

The fact that you know you're a kid means that you're already an adult.

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,500
How about it, Mr. Samurai? Care to stop by?

165
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,800
I'll throw in a little extra something.

166
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,300
Don't touch me, you tramp.

167
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,260
I didn't come to buy cheap women like you.

168
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,530
I heard that Hinowa, the best woman in Edo, is here.

169
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,260
As part of the movement to overthrow the Shogunate,

170
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,430
I want a woman of unsurpassed beauty to pour me my sake.

171
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,150
Lady Hinowa would never bother with country samurai like you.

172
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,330
Go home, you boors!

173
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,480
Are you making fun of warriors?!

174
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,290
I shall slay you! Stay right there!

175
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,310
Do you think that you can get away with this in this town?!

176
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,690
This is Yoshiwara.

177
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,700
It's a different world from the one above.

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,450
This is the land of women.

179
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,430
Oh? There really are beauties here.

180
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,380
How much are you?

181
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,910
You want to buy me?

182
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,010
How much? Tell me.

183
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,150
You've already...

184
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,090
paid the price.

185
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,540
You're a Hyakka!

186
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,170
She's a member of...

187
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,590
...the Hyakka, Yoshiwara's para-military force!

188
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,490
If you don't...

189
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,360
hold a rose carefully, you'll get pierced by its thorns.

190
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,930
That kid's holding out pretty long.

191
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,800
How long has it been since he came here?

192
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,680
He's quite a find. He's clever, honest, and learns his job quickly.

193
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,400
I'd like Catherine to learn from him.

194
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,520
He probably knows he has no way out.

195
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,360
He's seen quite a lot for a kid.

196
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,540
Seita's changed.

197
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,540
It's great. The look in his eyes has gotten better.

198
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,530
Are you going there?

199
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,390
Huh? What are you talking about?

200
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,450
You know the significance of Yoshiwara, right?

201
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,510
It's the place where men's dreams are granted, right?

202
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,710
Not that.

203
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,470
There's a dark side to Yoshiwara.

204
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,490
It's an extraterritorial area that's beyond the laws above ground.

205
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,800
One man is making that possible.

206
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,140
Hosen, the King of the Night.

207
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,570
He is the owner of Yoshiwara Shangri-La and the most powerful man in Yoshiwara.

208
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,710
Even top officials in the Shogunate cannot touch him.

209
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,280
He is the king of the land of eternal night.

210
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,290
He goes by many names, but he's dangerous.

211
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,070
Those who have gone after him have never seen the light of day ever again.

212
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,860
That's what people say about him.

213
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,350
King of the Night, huh?

214
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,350
Come to think of it, we haven't seen him lately.

215
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,310
I wonder what happened to that scruffy kid.

216
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,150
Oh, you mean Seita?

217
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,300
Yeah.

218
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,900
The dirty kid who brought us money every day because he wanted to meet Hinowa.

219
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,500
Ah. Well, I heard that he recently got a proper job.

220
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,410
There's a place that hired him?

221
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,120
Yeah. There sure are some freaky people.

222
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,510
He's stopped coming every day, but he still comes once a week.

223
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,110
He brings all his money. It's pretty amazing.

224
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,350
Before, he used to look like a filthy stray dog,

225
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,190
but he's cleaned up now.

226
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,000
He's really chilled out and become more child-like.

227
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,860
Oh? Is that so? So, how much has he saved up?

228
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,500
Huh? How much what?

229
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,940
The money that Seita's been bringing every day, of course.

230
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,050
He's been looking at Hinowa every day

231
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,770
as if she were the sun, just as her name suggests.

232
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,120
He should have enough to at least have tea with her.

233
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,850
You can't mean to tell me that you...

234
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:04,890
Come on. It's impossible for a stray dog like that to meet Hinowa.

235
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,930
She probably wouldn't even talk to us.

236
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,410
Besides, that money was good for getting a drink every day.

237
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,340
You're really terrible.

238
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,340
So you don't have a single sen of it?

239
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,440
None at all.

240
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,350
Why should we care? We're talking about a stray.

241
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,500
He's probably doing despicable things to get that money.

242
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,970
He can't complain.

243
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:35,180
That's probably true. Take me with you the next time Seita comes.

244
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,470
Whoops. I shouldn't have said anything.

245
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,630
I thought so.

246
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,430
Oh well.

247
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,080
I never thought that it was possible for Seita to pay to see her.

248
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
Miss, how much do I owe you?

249
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,590
You don't need to pay. You made me feel better.

250
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,000
Do you know Seita?

251
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,350
He was well-known around here.

252
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,470
This isn't the sort of place where children come to.

253
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,910
This is all they have?

254
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,610
Are you trying to get Hinowa and Seita to meet each other?

255
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,120
It's a nuisance to have a noisy kid live with me.

256
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,060
I just came to see if he had any relatives.

257
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,640
How can someone without money meet Hinowa?

258
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,960
Hinowa is the highest ranking courtesan in Yoshiwara.

259
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,300
You have to be a pretty important customer in order to meet her.

260
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,880
You should probably give up.

261
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,070
Yoshiwara Shangri-La is a country bound by different laws.

262
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,530
Things don't follow the same rules as above.

263
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,170
If you don't follow the rules here, you'll never return to the surface ever again.

264
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,960
Sorry.

265
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,750
Above or below, I live by my own rules.

266
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,830
Intruder! Intruder!

267
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,950
Tsk! Things have gotten troublesome!

268
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,750
What's this? What's going on?

269
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,120
Hey... Wait, Seita-kun!

270
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,380
It's hard to walk in this!

271
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,760
Walk quickly, Shinpachi!

272
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,260
Are the Hyakka on the move?

273
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,910
It seems that a strange ronin has snuck in.

274
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,280
One of the Hyakka was defeated. He's pretty strong.

275
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,300
I hear he's looking for Hinowa.

276
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,830
That's not unusual.

277
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,300
She is the sun in this land of eternal night.

278
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,590
The women are treated as inmates in this prison.

279
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,650
But she is the only one whose eyes

280
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,620
show no signs of weariness, vulgarity, or worry.

281
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,630
Even though she's here, underground,

282
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,510
her soul remains unbroken.

283
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,170
She will never lose her true beauty.

284
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,690
All the women in this town have great respect for her.

285
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,500
And all the men who come to this town love her,

286
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,730
even though she is beyond their reach.

287
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,500
No.

288
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,310
It seems that that ronin doesn't want to meet Hinowa,

289
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,280
but was hired by that child.

290
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,070
That child who said he wanted to meet Hinowa and was hanging around?

291
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,200
So it is him. I had ignored him because I thought it wasn't worth my time.

292
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,930
From what I have learned...

293
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,710
There's no mistake. He's that child from eight years ago.

294
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,240
I see. I thought that he had died off somewhere,

295
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,310
but I never thought that he would follow Hinowa's scent all the way here.

296
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,560
It's dangerous for Hinowa and that child to come into contact with each other.

297
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,670
Are you saying she'll try to escape with him again?

298
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,830
She won't ever escape.

299
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,720
She knows too much about the underground to live above ground.

300
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,720
We need to keep her in the eternal night until she dies.

301
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,340
Use Tsukuyo.

302
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,260
We can't defeat him unless we use whatever means possible.

303
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:31,030
Don't let that child or that ronin get back to the surface alive.

304
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,820
What?!

305
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,540
They used up my money?!

306
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,750
Yeah.

307
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,200
Those shopkeepers you've been leaving your money with

308
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,810
were jerks who would use the brothel's money.

309
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,200
It seems they were well-known for it.

310
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,620
Those bastards!

311
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,550
I changed myself and worked hard, but it was all for nothing!

312
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,550
It wasn't for nothing. We were watching you.

313
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,110
You'd be too embarrassed to meet your mother if you had picked pockets.

314
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,100
You were working really hard.

315
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,410
What's the point in any of that?!

316
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,510
If I don't have money, I can't meet my mom.

317
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,040
It's meaningless!

318
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,260
It has meaning.

319
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,690
Dressed like this, we can meet your mother openly.

320
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,710
Besides, it's strange to have to pay to meet your mother.

321
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,770
Parents and children should be able to see each other whenever they want.

322
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,450
Do you think that granny made you work for her

323
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,920
so you could make some worthless money?

324
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,840
Odd Jobs Gin...

325
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,760
...will take up...

326
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,890
...your case.

327
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,730
B-Both of you...

328
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,950
It's impossible! You can't meet a courtesan without money!

329
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,390
This place doesn't follow the same rules as above.

330
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,970
Wh-What?!

331
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,130
That's... That scar...

332
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,720
Who is she?

333
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,990
The Hyakka are a para-military force that punishes those who break the laws of Yoshiwara.

334
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,450
She's the Yoshiwara's strongest guard and leader of the Hyakka!

335
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,120
She is feared as the Courtesan of Death.

336
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,930
I am Tsukuyo.

337
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,780
Pleased to meet you!

338
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,180
[To be continued...]

339
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:13,680
[Preview]

340
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,140
Gin, this is bad.

341
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,130
He has a really dangerous air about him.

342
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,400
He smells of blood...the smell of blood from surviving countless battles.

343
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,250
The smell of a true Yato.

344
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,090
["Beware of Those Who Use an Umbrella on a Sunny Day!"]

345
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,100
Why is he here?

346
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:49,000
Otose
