00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,170
Boy, the year's already over, huh?

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,390
Sure was fast.

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,900
I hate how the years go by faster as we get older.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,440
At this rate, by the time I'm an old geezer,

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,400
the years will pass at the speed of a Formula 1 car.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,730
I've still got a long ways to go.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,160
Well, I'm already up to Ben Johnson speed, I'd say.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,080
My Ben Johnson is already up to here.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,310
[Note: In Japanese, Ben also refers to Poop. So here Gin is referring to his incontinence.]

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,310
Don't get too cocky because you're all still young.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,810
Your Ben Johnson will fall behind soon enough.

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,370
For real? Ben Johnson's gonna fall out?

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,400
[Note: Carl Lewis is a famous track and field athlete.]

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,400
I prefer Carl Lewis over Ben Johnson. He's cooler.

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,750
Well, all I'm saying is, we all had a pretty good year, right?

17
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:55,180
Hell no! It's still February! We still have eleven months left!

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,510
...Because this script was written in December.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,710
That's right. Do you know how long it takes to make an anime?

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,980
When they make an anime, they should know the airdate!

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,370
They did. Like, at the end of the year, they closed out with a "group date,"

22
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,230
which reminded me of a year-end party.

23
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,800
On January 3rd, they thought the perfect episode would be "My first dream of the new year."

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,420
They really had a lot of ideas.

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,250
But the airdate schedules were completely messed up because of the Japan Series

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,730
and the New Year's special programs.

27
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,230
We don't need that kind of frank information.

28
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,800
Moreover, the show was supposed to finish after the second year,

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,950
so they planned BLEEP and BLEEP episodes,

30
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,580
a BLEEP version and a BLEEP story to make it to episode 100, the last show.

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,990
They carefully planned the whole series,

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,910
but now they say the show will be extending to a third year, so the story must be dragged on.

33
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,020
Give me a break, really.

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,710
[Note: Spoof of Cop TV shows. Older cops often say such a thing to youngsters.]

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,640
The people who will suffer later are us and the detectives at the site.

36
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,710
They don't understand anything.

37
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,210
"An anime isn't something that can be created in a meeting room."

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,210
[Note: Spoof of famous line from the Japanese film "Bayside Shakedown."]

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,350
It's made from the strange juices the animator squeezes out.

40
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,760
By the way, will this show enter a third year?

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,800
Is it all right to say something that important at this point in the series?

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,040
No problem.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,060
Everyone would have known it in the next issue of the anime magazine, anyway...

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,800
Ah... I had hoped the show would be sorely missed and comments like

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
"We want to watch Gin-chan again!" would pour in,

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,890
so it would return to prime time a half year later, Reborn!

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,890
[Note: Spoof of Reborn the manga/anime.]

48
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,280
No way! Sounds like you're dreaming!

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,780
Until just recently, we were afraid the show was going to be canceled at any moment,

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,620
so how can we return to prime time? I really don't get what you're talking about!

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,190
I heard DVD sales are going pretty well.

52
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,550
It doesn't matter.

53
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,270
No matter how many DVDs are sold, not even a cent comes back to the show.

54
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,010
The production costs never increase.

55
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,130
Really... Aniplex entices people with unscrupulous cover designs on every DVD.

56
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,110
No, it's not that kind of cover.

57
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,260
And Gin-san please stop talking about money on the air.

58
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,510
Recently, you said, "Give us a budget, even if it's half of BLEEP,"

59
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,810
so the director of BLEEP, Director Mizushima, complained to us.

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:56,040
[Note: Seiji Mizushima is the director of "GUNDAM 00.]

61
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,040
It didn't mean BLEEP, but BLEEP.

62
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,180
It's so confusing because they bleep out everything.

63
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,500
All right, I'll correct them. It wasn't BLEEP, it was BLEEP.

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,930
Hey, it's the same thing if they use bleeps!

65
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,960
For all of those reasons, we can't just halt the show,

66
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,470
stock up enough episodes and then restart.

67
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,240
Therefore, the GinTama anime drags on for a third year.

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,300
Drags on?!

69
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,100
When a weekly manga series becomes a long-term animation,

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,030
it always encounters the same problem.

71
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:29,100
A twenty-page weekly manga and a thirty-minute anime show run at different speeds,

72
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,240
so the anime will eventually catch up to the manga.

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,710
Regardless, with this issue,

74
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,110
our predecessors took various measures to make their shows dragged on.

75
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:46,200
[This is a repeat of the
previous episode to use up time.]

76
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:46,200
[What's this?]

77
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,370
The first way is to look back at the last episode.

78
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,980
At the beginning of the show,

79
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,480
repeat the last scene from the previous episode for about five minutes, so it drags on.

80
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,820
In some shows,

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,710
it takes more than ten minutes before the episode titles show up, which is amazing.

82
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,210
But basically GinTama is a self-contained show, so we can't do it that way.

83
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,960
Next is to insert flashbacks...

84
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,300
When two people face off in battle scenes and reach a deadlock,

85
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,230
an all-knowing old man appears.

86
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:22,510
[Replaying old scenes]

87
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:22,510
[Old man]

88
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,700
And he says something like, "That's so and so, blah, blah, blah..."

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,230
and replays old scenes for a long time.

90
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,520
In one anime,

91
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,830
the main characters never throw a punch at each other during the 30-minute show.

92
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,010
But GinTama isn't a battle manga. So we can't use that either.

93
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,930
But, GinTama created a way...

94
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,520
to drag on the episode that even its predecessors couldn't think of.

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,630
That would be...

96
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,000
That would be...?

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,510
That would be...

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,730
All right, five minutes have passed.

99
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,110
[The GinTama anime has amazingly entered its third year! Is it really okay to continue the show?]

100
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,050
[So the full show is coming up next. Sniper VS Gintoki Breakdown Battle.]

101
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,670
A long time ago, a strategist once said

102
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,470
that an excellent strategist who emerges victorious from a fight...

103
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,380
is nothing more than a big coward.

104
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,410
A cowardly man who is frightened by an unexpected situation...

105
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,140
and thus takes all possible precautions.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,580
And he never starts a fight until the conditions are set up in his favor.

107
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,310
Really, what that guy said is totally right.

108
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,080
Thanks to that, I ended up in a really messy room for nearly three months.

109
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,820
However, it's about a strategist.

110
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,660
You can't win a fight by being cowardly.

111
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,590
There is one more thing you need to win a fight.

112
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,250
It's the bravery soldiers who charge a huge army have.

113
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,340
In other words, I, the lone wolf,

114
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,640
have to be a cowardly strategist as well as a brave soldier.

115
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,950
What a hardship.

116
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:50,010
It seems I have some talent as a strategist, but as a soldier, I seem to be worthless.

117
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,340
I've been doing this for 20 years, but my hand still shakes every time I go to work.

118
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:02,930
I always make elaborate plans and hide in a very safe place...

119
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,910
and only when the target appears, do I strike.

120
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,430
What I do, some people with foul mouths say I'm...

[COWARDLY AND DULL]

[A TURTLE.]

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,870
Since that day, I've been called "Turtle the Sniper."

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,470
What an easygoing name.

129
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,580
Who would imagine that I'm the best assassin in Edo?

130
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,330
Right... Some say I'm the strongest assassin, but that's wrong.

131
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
I'm just the biggest coward in Edo.

132
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,460
The reason why I am so good at handling a dangerous weapon is

133
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,550
that I have neither the power nor the courage to beat my target to death barehanded.

134
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,200
And the reason why I never miss my target is that I'm afraid he'll

135
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,380
come back and take revenge.

136
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:07,590
The reason why I murder anyone for money is because I worry about retirement.

137
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,400
The target comes to the park on Sunday afternoons to walk his dog.

138
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,280
According to my information, he's someone who works for the Bakufu,

139
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,840
and that's enough for me.

140
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,270
All I have to do is wait for my hands to stop shaking.

141
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,610
And wait for my confidence to come out of its shell.

142
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,320
But...

143
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,920
...my hands won't stop shaking.

144
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,990
The man who appears before me isn't a cowardly strategist...

145
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,080
...nor a brave soldier, nor a target. He's...

Is he looking at me? Why is he looking at me?

No way.

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,330
Kamekichi seems to have noticed there's something wrong

157
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,290
as I hear him moving around in the water tank behind me.

158
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,070
Kamekichi, it looks like I screwed up.

159
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,370
It took half a year, including preparation time,

160
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,620
until I could carry out this assassination.

161
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,640
I had many opportunities to get my target.

162
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,940
Nevertheless, the reason why I waited for so long

163
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,390
was to make sure my target is completely eliminated.

164
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,140
And above all I wanted to ensure my own safety.

165
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,560
Information leaks are impossible.

166
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,820
I didn't contact anyone and literally waited with bated breath in my shell.

167
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,270
And yet...

168
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,510
Why was there a leak?!

169
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,120
That man...must have figured out Matsudaira's assassination plan!

170
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,130
Since the plan's been discovered, there's no way Matsudaira will come to the park.

171
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,430
I should escape. However, my body won't move.

172
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,790
That man's piercing eyes won't let me.

173
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,940
My instincts sense a danger stronger than any I've felt before. This is really bad.

174
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,800
He's not an underling of Matsudaira's.

175
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:41,060
Perhaps he's a hired goon. No, he must be better than that.

176
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,700
Those eyes are the eyes of a beast...in search of blood and on the hunt for souls.

177
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,190
If I break eye contact for even an instant...

178
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,790
...I'll be killed.

179
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,250
He's smiling! In this situation... I'm pointing a gun and he's smiling?! What a man!

180
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,820
Provocation! He's provoking me. He seems to want to fight me one-on-one.

181
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,900
At this distance, there's no way he can use that wooden sword.

182
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,990
He must have some terrible hidden weapon.

183
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,460
From his smile, it looks like a bazooka...or a rocket launcher.

184
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,530
No, there's a possibility he might even be holding a nuclear missile.

185
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,190
If he shoots that kind of thing, I'm done for.

186
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,710
Oh, Oh! Really...

187
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,860
I unconsciously pulled the trigger.

188
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,070
It was my instincts from being a killer for so many years.

189
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,300
And because I'm a coward, my ability to sense danger...

190
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,700
is so strong that my body reacts instinctively before my brain can process it.

191
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,980
As if celebrating my victory,

192
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,750
I hear Kamekichi making noise in the water tank behind me.

193
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,450
Kamekichi, pray for him instead of celebrating for me.

194
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,980
A nosebleed?!

195
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,210
He has just a nosebleed after being shot?

196
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,960
Impossible! It was a rifle! He has a nosebleed after being shot by a rifle?

197
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,580
It's not like a dodge ball game in elementary school.

198
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:34,620
Bullets don't work against him! It's unbelievable. What a guy!

199
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,600
Against such a monster, I'll face more dangers than one could imagine.

200
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,750
I have to find a way to escape!

201
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,230
That's...a cop!

202
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,020
Impossible!

203
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,270
This is the person who was staring at me.

204
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,100
Were you peeking at her?

205
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,860
When did he call in reinforcements?

206
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,320
He didn't show any signs of contacting them at all.

207
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,590
No, I wasn't peeking.

208
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,880
Your nose is bleeding.

209
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,260
I wonder how he could do that...

210
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,760
[HELP]

211
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,760
That's! That bloodstain says, "HELP." Well, at least it looks like it.

212
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,670
What a guy!

213
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,980
Don't tell me he used his own nosebleed to call in reinforcements!

214
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,130
But if she leaves the curtains open that wide,

215
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,320
there's no way I can avoid seeing it, right? So I saw her.

216
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,440
That's enough. Come with us to the station.

217
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,630
What? Why?!

218
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,060
That's it! He's giving them some kind of order!

219
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,150
Excuse me. It's the Oedo Newspaper.

220
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,780
Are you subscribing to any newspapers?

221
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,120
How stupid!

222
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,900
Excuse me!

223
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,910
They are not from the newspaper!

224
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,750
This is... Does this mean my room is already surrounded by the enemy?!

225
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,400
How well prepared! In a situation like this, I can't escape!

226
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,460
Kamekichi seems to have noticed my anxiousness,

227
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,860
because he isn't making any sounds in the tank behind me.

228
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,380
Kamekichi, don't give up until the end!

229
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,780
The balcony!

230
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,020
Now that it's come to this, the only way I can escape is to jump down from the balcony.

231
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,850
No...

232
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,380
...Impossible! Wh-Why are there so many people here?!

233
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,630
All of a sudden... What the hell is going on?!

234
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,230
How could he gather so many people?!

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,580
Everyone looks so hostile and is staring at me!

236
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,610
Let me die!

237
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,950
Hey, you! What are you doing?! Don't be stupid!

238
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,620
"Don't be stupid"? You're telling me not to do anything "stupid"?

239
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,590
But no matter how I look at this situation...

240
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,330
It's impossible!

241
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,130
Do you want to die?! Don't move!

242
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,100
If I move, I'm done for. But if I don't move, I'm done for.

243
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,920
I'll come right over! Wait for me!

244
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,570
It doesn't matter if I hide in a shell, or come out... Death waits for me anyway.

245
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:11,970
Whether I die bravely or timidly.... No, as a killer, I don't have the right to choose.

246
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,910
I'm not sure if Kamekichi noticed my sentiment,

247
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,400
but he was crying in the water tank behind me...

248
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,400
Huh? Is he crying?

249
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,370
He's crying! Eggs!

250
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm not sure if he knew what the name I gave him meant,

251
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,230
[Note: Kamekichi is a male name.]

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,660
but in the water tank behind me, I noticed Kamekichi was actually a female.

253
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,510
No... An assassin has no right to choose how he dies.

254
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,860
Then I shouldn't die. I'll live forever.

255
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,570
I've taken so many lives so timidly until now...

256
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,690
...but this time, in order to protect these new lives...

257
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,230
[I'LL BECOME A COWARD.]

258
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,470
When you think you can't win a fight, just run away.

259
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,150
Kamekichi, let's take a chance and jump to get

260
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,070
to the building on the other side!

261
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,970
My shaking stopped before I knew it.

262
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,310
We're almost there!

263
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,310
Almost...

264
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,230
He did it!

265
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,460
Great job!

266
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,090
She's been saved! Great! It's a miracle!

267
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,690
The man under her acted as a cushion!

268
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,890
I've never seen someone as brave as him!

269
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,200
Come on!

270
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,340
Hey, we need to move him right away. Let's help this brave man!

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,400
Well...

273
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,370
In recognition of your brave actions,

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,080
we present to you this certificate of appreciation and a gift.

You did a great job.

[A huge piece of chocolate fell from the sky, and the person who dropped it is a huge woman.]

Okay, next is the King Kong pair. Good luck!

Today's GinTama has ended.

Yeah, today's GinTama is over.

It's not finished yet! There's still five minutes left!

It's time to read comments from viewers!

288
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,820
What's with the "reading comments from viewers"?!

289
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,230
It's like it's not an anime show anymore!

[Note: Satellite Anime Theater anime shows are broadcasted on a NHK Broadcasting Satellite.]

291
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,080
You know, in "Satellite Anime Theater," they also read postcards from viewers.

292

[Note: Bleep covers up NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai aka Japan Broadcasting Corporation).]

293

This is not N(BLEEP)K! We're really in a rut!

294

All long-term JUMP anime get stuck in a rut.

Like BLEEP or BLEEP.

And if we don't take a breather once in a while, we won't last very long, you know?

297
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,580
Who needs to take a breather?

298
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,900
It's not taking a breather, just cutting corners.

299
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,080
Then let's start!

300
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,090
The first question is from Hanako Motoki-san from Toyama prefecture.

301
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,370
"Who cooks the meals at the Odd Jobs?

302
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,500
Is there anyone amongst the three who can cook decent food?"

303
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,060
Okay, I'll answer you.

304
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,640
We take turns.

305
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,520
Because Shinpachi lives with a sister like her,

306
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,570
he must of course be able to cook fairly well to survive.

307
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,720
Even though I, Gin-san, may not look it, I'm actually a very good cook.

308
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,220
I'm like the "Iron Chef."

309
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,090
And Kagura usually makes raw eggs on rice or rice with toppings.

310
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,320
That's like a meaningless question.

311
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,980
[Note: Chazuke is hot green tea poured over toppings on rice.]

312
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,830
I can make chazuke, too.

313
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,980
Well, the next question is from a person with the pen name STT Alpha-san.

314
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,930
"I have a question. It's about Shinpachi.

315
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,470
He looks like "the hopeless character with glasses who makes punch lines."

316
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,850
But he's pretty strong, isn't he? His house is actually a dojo...

317
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,110
Just, how strong is he?"

318
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,780
Okay, I'll answer you.

319
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,090
Shinpachi is very strong because

320
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,850
there're so many monsters around, but he doesn't look like it.

321
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,170
When I was in middle school, there was a kid named Kosuke-san,

322
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,760
who was the school gang leader and one year older than me.

323
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,210
Shinpachi is about three times stronger than him.

324
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,530
If there were three Kosuke-sans, seriously, no one would beat them.

325
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,490
Kosuke-san is really something.

326
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,250
Although Kosuke-san is a punk, his posture is very proper when he rides his bicycle.

327
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,110
He holds his back very straight. Kosuke-san is really something.

328
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,340
I don't get it! Who's Kosuke-san anyway?!

329
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

330
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,740
Shinpachi is only strong at saying the punch line.

331
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,370
He's basically a hopeless four-eyes.

332
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,120
Well, the next question is from Kudo-san from Aomori prefecture.

333
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,100
"In episode 58, Lavi shouted, "These things happen in war!!"

334
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,890
It looked like he was holding back tears, or was it just my imagination?

335
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,990
Well, it wasn't just my imagination.

336
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,540
Please answer like a man. Don't run away, Lavi."

337
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,650
He was crying. Well, I guess Lavi had many hardships.

338
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,680
It's like he was trying to convince himself

339
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,600
that there was nothing he could do about the war.

340
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,030
Well, I'm not Lavi, so I wouldn't really know.

341
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,290
[Note: D.Gray-man is an ongoing manga in JUMP]

342
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,290
Rather than saying I'm not Lavi, I'll say this anime isn't D.Gray-man!

343
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,900
It says it's addressed to D.Gray-man,

344
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,200
but this postcard came to us by mistake.

345
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,680
I'll make sure this postcard is delivered to D.Gray-man.

346
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,760
So Kudo-san, don't worry about it.

347
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,940
By the way, I guess you don't watch GinTama, do you?

348
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,910
You never thought your postcard would be read on this show.

349
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,780
We're really scraping bottom.

350
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,380
If this is the best we can come up with, we should just play Otsu-chan's song.

351
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,650
Oh, yeah! That's it!

352
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,900
So, we somehow managed.

353
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,280
No, no! We're really scraping bottom!

354
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,320
It's much better than dragging it on through the BLEEP and BLEEP.

355
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,370
Anyway, that was "Long-term Jump Anime is Hard."

356
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,820
That's not the title!

357
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,070
[Totally Naked GinTama]

358
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,030
I wonder if tonight's show was all right.

359
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,310
Well, I guess it was okay.

360
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,290
We're still on the air, by the way.

361
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,550
Really? Is it still on?

362
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,650
[So, we changed tonight's schedule. That was Totally Naked GinTama.]

363
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:41,490
[Starting next week, we'll get more serious. So please look forward to it.]
