00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,020
Well, Gin Tama the anime has finally begun its second year.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,550
But it's not like we're actually starting... More like we somehow slyly snuck into this.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,660
Correct! This is just the first step!

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,960
Huh? We're not all set for the year?

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,900
You fool! Don't you know how many times Gin Tama was almost pulled?

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,230
Low television ratings, changes in time slot and sponsorship, complaint letters...

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,740
That's true. Thank goodness, we didn't get cancelled.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,290
Before we started airing, everyone was saying,

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,830
"Hey, this is great. We'll be a hit in prime time."

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,810
But the moment ratings went down, they turned on us!

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,650
Grown-ups are all dirty! I hate grown-ups!

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,490
They sure took us off prime time fast.

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,890
In a flash... What's this, "Isn't it a better time for JUMP viewers?"

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,590
No matter how you put it, we got kicked outta prime!

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,250
What if we keep getting bounced around and end up next to "Ladies 4"?!

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,800
By the way, Otsu's song was banned from broadcast because of licensing issues.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,540
If sponsors drop off because of such claims, this program's done for!

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:05,340
They'll say they want to up ratings, announce that Gin Tama is good for diets and we're done for!

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,480
You're right!

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,580
Watching anime as a diet?! There's no such thing!

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,420
The producer said his stomach  hurts and looks skinnier every time I see him!

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,060
That wasn't from a diet. Anyway, Gin-san, don't scare us! Our second season is about to start!

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,730
Shut up! That's the very reason I'm saying we can't let down our guard!

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,960
If we think, "Oh boy, we can coast for one more year," we'll be dropped in six months!

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,720
Huh?! Seriously?!

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,230
Gin-chan, is Gin Tama going to end?

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,140
That's why we have to do whatever we can!

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,630
Have to do...

30
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,250
...whatever we can?

31
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:33,810
That's...!

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,540
That's?

33
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,310
That comes after the commercial.

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:47,090
[Gin Tama the anime's second year has begun. But there's something we have to do.]

35
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,890
Since the anime Gin Tama is beginning its second year, there is something we must do!

36
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,670
Something we...

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,530
...must do?

38
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,200
That's...

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,530
That's?

40
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,400
Put some boost in it!

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,910
[Put some boost in it!]

42
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,620
Put some boost in it! The words mean just that.

43
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,440
Programs that have slumped or programs that didn't get a swift start get some boost...

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,200
and strategies are instigated to hike up its popularity.

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,150
However,

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,150
[However]

47
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,990
it can get rather difficult with writers in an uproar, and sometimes the boost fails.

48
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,770
And any action can be too late. So success is never guaranteed.

49
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:38,270
So speak up if you have any good ideas about how to make Gin Tama better.

50
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:44,040
Well... The easiest and fastest solution is to change the title of the program.

51
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,080
For example...

52
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,480
Gin Tama 2.

53
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,450
Or Gin Tamas.

54
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,190
[Note: X and Z, as in Dragon Ball X, etc.]

55
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,190
There's also Z and X or Second Season.

56
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,840
What's the meaning of G, V and Turn A?

57
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,840
[Note: Turn A as in Turn A Gundam.]

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,510
Yeah, I think V stands for something.

59
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,450
How about we add something sad to make it seem like it's the final one?

60
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,160
Like "Farewell," or "Forever," or "Complete Version"?

61
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,160
[Note: This refers to the anime Battleship Yamato]

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,020
We just have to say, "A new journey begins," and start over again.

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,910
Hey Gin-san... They're still fighting about that, so don't bring it up.

64
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,830
[Note: This refers to pop singer Noriyuki Makihara.]

65
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,830
I know! Let's get Makki to sing the theme song!

66
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,300
I said they're still fighting about that!

67
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,690
Then how about we use, "More of" or "Again" like the Abunai series?

68
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,520
In that case, "Tamatama Gin Tama" sounds better.

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,830
What does that mean?!

70
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,580
Hmm... Well, just changing the title won't fool viewers these days.

71
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,180
If we're gonna do something, we have to go all out.

72
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,760
Like changing to a main robot or inventing new weapons. Power up in a way that's obvious.

73
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,080
This anime has no robots or transformers.

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,540
Oh...

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,460
Come on! You're hopeless. Maybe it's not the robot we should change, but the main character!

76
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,360
Are you serious?

77
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,600
Kagura-chan?

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,550
Changing main characters sounds good.

79
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,360
Huh?!

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,980
From next week on, I'll be the main character! We'll go forth with Gin Tama like this!

81
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,610
The man swore his eternal love.

82
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,610
And the woman swore to return his love.

83
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,900
But then...

84
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,450
A single gun shot...

85
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,150
["Once Upon a Time in China-Girl"]
[Gin Tama]

86
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,320
A chance encounter.

87
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,760
Two people fall in love...

88
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,300
And live a simple life.

89
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,630
But then...

90
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,330
One single bowl of noodles...

91
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,960
She's still eating that!

92
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,310
The flow of time separates the two...

93
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,170
Kagura!!

94
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,270
Gin-chan!

95
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,830
Then the stage turns towards outer-space.

96
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,070
What could Catherine be scheming?

97
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,120
I said I, Catherine, will rule!

98
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,760
And, what is this? The plan to destroy earth by Otose of Teradaya?!

99
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,600
A young girl tossed around by fate!!

100
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,880
The best in the Edo film world have been gathered to create this epic drama,

101
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,770
[Directed by: Sonomanma Miyazaki (Puke Wars)]
[Screenplay by: Kenta Nukesaku (Alien vs Yakuza)]
[Music by: Joe Hisaishi (My Neighbor Pedro)]
[Original Story by: Gasuko Hajida (Life is full of demons, curse you!)]

102
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,530
Gin Tama: Once Upon a Time in China-Girl.

103
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,510
You have yet to know the real Gin Tama.

104
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,500
[Broadcast starts next week.]

105
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,910
Oh, so touching!

106
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,690
Quit using my name without permission!

107
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,120
Hey, what's this? At times like these, why don't you come to me for help?

108
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,200
Otose, when'd you get here?

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,520
Running a store and an anime are basically the same things.

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,220
You give customers what they want. And supplement whatever's missing.

111
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,000
What's missing?

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,610
I've been thinking, the things you do are childish.

113
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,730
Fools are fine. But it gets pretty boring after a while.

114
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,110
She means you lack a refreshing sexiness.

115
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,480
Evoke dreams, evoke happiness... That's the kind of story you must create.

116
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,870
Oh no!

117
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm late, I'm late!

118
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,390
Oww!

119
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,890
Owww! No way! It's Cassapee!

120

[Note: Japanese School Girl slang for Catherine]

121

[Note: Japanese School Girl slang for Otose]

122
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,970
Otossechi, are you late too?

123
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,160
These two attend Kabukicho middle school...

124
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,370
...and are childhood friends.

125
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,100
They're average girls, but...

126
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
They have a secret, which is...

127
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,150
Oh no...

128
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,430
There's someone about to get their soul sucked out of their butt.

129
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,430
[Note: In folklore, kappa or water imps will suck out your entrails/life force from your anus.]

130
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,200
Collecting debts! No mercy!

131
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,060
Yes! These two are...

132
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,990
Magical Mature Females! We are Tama Cure Silver Soul!

We...

135

...will not lose!!

136
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,570
Nuts, Kiss Chocolates, Persimmon Seeds!

137
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,040
We'll fix things that are dried and old!

138
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,950
The customer's always right!

139
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,110
The friendship these two share will protect the world!

140
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,900
We are Tama Cure Silver Soul!

141
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,810
Do you want us all to vomit to death?!

142
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,800
You can keep fighting till the end of the century!

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,240
You're revolting!

144
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,880
Instead of evoking dreams, you're evoking fear and despair!

145
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,120
I agree.

146
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,000
Zura...

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,110
It's not Zura. It's Katsura.

148
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,810
How long has he been sitting here? And he's totally ready to join the conversation.

149
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,810
If you're going for it, you need something cutting edge. How about this?

150
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,720
[Check it out!]

151
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,100
Yo Zura... Wazzup?

152
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,520
It ain't Zura. It's Katsura.

153
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,920
What about work?

154
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,050
I work at a ramen shop right now.

155
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,750
Huh? Fired?

156
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,850
I'm going to save up my money and leave this town someday.

157
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,360
[You're genius.]

[Your dreams will certainly come true.]

00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,250
But one day...

317
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,080
In the peaceful jungle...

318
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,430
...danger approaches.

319
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,320
All right.

320
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,190
Now, with vast space as his stage,

321
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,140
the Prince of the Jungle begins a new journey to find new friends!

322
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,380
The Prince of Jungle.

323
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,650
And where's the "love and peace"?! You abandoned your friends!

324
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,290
In life, you have to know when to give up.

325
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,150
Hey! A monkey? You made me a monkey?!

326
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,550
I don't want that either! Shinpachi is the only monkey!

327
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,390
Only me?! What do you mean?!

328
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,690
My story is still the best.

329
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,660
That's why I hate amateurs! Speak for yourself!

330
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,870
I think when we look at all the options, my idea is the best.

331
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,100
Just who are you?

332
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,970
Just passing by, I'm Captain Katsura.

333
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,170
Whoever you are, my idea has the most heart and effort.

334
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,830
Isn't it going to be just another "The Dog Food of the World" kind of program?

335
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,810
Shut up! Hey!

336
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,550
Toshi, stop! My idea is the best.

337
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,480
No way, gorilla! My idea is best.

338
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
No, we should go by age and that's me.

339
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,190
No, my idea is the best.

340
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,190
No, mine...

341
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,820
My success story is...!

342
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,760
Hey everyone... I haven't even had a word in edgewise.

343
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,770
Shut up, four-eyes! You don't even have any character goods on sale, so shut up!

344
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,770
[Note: Character goods as in tie-in merchandise.]

345
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,900
And that's been really bothering me, too...

346
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,470
Shut up!!

347
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,970
I'd expected it, but this is really turning into a lot of drama.

348
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,710
Anyway, since I'm the main character, I will decide!

349
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,110
Gin-chan...

350
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,590
You're right. You should make a firm decision right now!

351
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,360
Leave it to me. This is my answer!

352
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,130
Sit and watch!

353
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,240
Huh?

354
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,220
Nothing's started.

355
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,300
Not only did it not start, the ending is already over.

356
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,820
Oh... See? Nothing's settled.

357
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,220
I figured as much. It was a bad idea to leave it up to you guys in the first place.

358
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,350
What're you saying, Elizabeth?

359
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm not Elizabeth today.

360
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,640
Huh? Who are you?

361
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,070
C-Could you be...the direc...?

362
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,920
That's right. I'm sorry. I'll do it right from next week on. I'm really sorry.

363
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,880
[Preview]

364
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,840
No way. This can't be happening. You've gotta be kidding!

365
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,150
["Milk Should be Served at Body Temperature."]

366
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:35,150
[Gin-san has an illegitimate child?! Is he guilty?!]

367
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:40,090
[We did it because I was upset. Now we apologize. Next time we're aiming for a serious Gin Tama.]
