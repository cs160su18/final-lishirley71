00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,440
I came after hearing about
a corpse-eating demon...

3
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,370
Would that be you?

4
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,940
A rather cute demon.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,420
Did you also take that from a corpse?

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,300
A single child stripping corpses
to protect himself, is it?

7
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,510
That's very impressive.

8
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,180
However, you no longer need that sword.

9
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,940
A sword that's only swung in self-defense,
while fearing others,

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,480
should be thrown away.

11
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,410
I shall give you my sword.

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,880
If you wish to learn how
to properly use it...

13
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,100
Then come with me.

14
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,910
Hey...

15
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,670
Get your hands off her.

16
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,860
Get your stinkin' hands off this woman.

17
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,110
Y-You're...?!

18
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,270
Gintoki...

19
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,990
Why did you...

20
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,750
come here...?

21
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:03,180
["The More Precious the Burden, the Heavier
and More Difficult It Is to Shoulder It."]

22
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,130
Look at yourself...

23
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I told you to run...

24
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,270
You fool...

25
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,290
I won't be dying.

26
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,560
Nobody will be dying.

27
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,030
I won't let anyone die in Yoshiwara.

28
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,160
You see...

29
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,920
We aren't gonna leave you all alone.

30
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,360
You followed my threads
to find this place?

31
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,440
Commendable.

32
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,910
[Note: A reference to Ryunosuke Akutagawa's
"The Spider's Thread"]

33
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,460
They say one climbs the spider
thread to reach for paradise...

34
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,910
Instead, you climb up to reach for hell.

35
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,400
Your idiocy would leave Buddha
and Enma both speechless.

36
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,680
Wait, Gintoki...!

37
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,370
Don't bother telling me to run again.

38
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,780
Trying to shoulder the burden
all by yourself?

39
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,040
Don't be such a stranger.

40
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,430
Weep and ask for help.

41
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,730
Lean on me with your runny nose.

42
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,740
Cry when you feel like crying.

43
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,910
Laugh when you feel like laughing.

44
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,740
When you're tearing up with an ugly face,

45
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,880
I'll give you a good cry
with an uglier face.

46
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,580
When you're laughing so
hard your stomach hurts,

47
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,950
I'll laugh in a louder voice.

48
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,490
That's how it should be.

49
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,150
It's far better to get dirty while
living true to yourself,

50
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,870
than to throw away yourself
and die a clean death.

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,100
You offer to carry her burden?

52
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,950
You will help carry Tsukuyo's burden?

53
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,450
Don't you understand?

54
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,320
You are Tsukuyo's burden.

55
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,690
You people are the reason Tsukuyo
has suffered so much.

56
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,730
The reason she's grown so hideous.

57
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,190
Tsukuyo, you must be hungry.

58
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,440
I shall prepare you a top class meal.

59
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,420
Of the pathetic worm who followed
the moon into my web.

60
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,650
I don't give a damn about
who you've betrayed.

61
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,750
Do whatever you like to the
Shogun or any other lords.

62
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,780
But you called yourself her master

63
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,180
and then you betrayed your student...

64
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,170
who's believed in you
since she was a kid...

65
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,030
Who's followed in your
footsteps for so long...

66
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,500
You made her your prey.

67
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,090
You don't deserve to call
yourself her master...

68
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,970
You don't deserve to
call her your student.

69
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,220
Get lost.

70
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,690
Don't ever show your face around
her again, you sick son of a bitch!!

71
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,390
This man...

72
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,620
His eyes aren't that of a prey.

73
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,550
Nor the eyes of a meal.

74
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,370
My threads are quivering.

75
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,760
My web is reacting to an
unprecedented invasion.

76
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,530
That's...

77
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,570
Those eyes are...!

78
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,470
Jiraia...

79
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,390
You're the one who's been
caught in a web.

80
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,050
My web.

81
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,270
Now that you've made
a mess of my place,

82
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,870
don't expect to leave alive.

83
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,120
Spill your rotten gut as you die!

84
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,820
A battle between hunters?

85
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,770
Amusing.

86
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,670
I'll show you who the
master of this web is.

87
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,560
Any place with my threads, be it the
six realms, shall be part of my web!

88
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,150
You cannot catch me with those injuries.

89
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,100
Do you intend to escape outside?!

90
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,430
Fool!

91
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,330
You're the fool.

92
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,010
Gotcha.

93
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,360
Now, time for supper.

94
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,850
Let's dig in!

95
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,070
If you wish to learn how
to properly use it...

96
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,130
Then come with me.

97
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,970
From now on, you will swing that sword.

98
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,850
Not to cut down your enemies.

99
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,230
Not to cut away your weaknesses
and protect yourself.

100
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,670
But to protect your very soul.

101
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,070
Gintoki!

102
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,410
How...?

103
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,990
How can you have power that rivals mine?

104
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,690
By someone unable to abandon
their sense of self...

105
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,240
By someone who can't even sever their ties,
just to have a place to return to...?!

106
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,140
I have sacrificed everything...

107
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,550
My sense of self, my home,
even my comrades...

108
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,060
All for my prey...

109
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,590
For you...

110
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,340
Yet why...? Why?!

111
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,820
You still can't understand?

112
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,950
Some of the things you sacrificed
were too important.

113
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,930
You abandoned your comrades?

114
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,870
No.

115
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,960
You were afraid of losing your comrades.

116
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,330
You fought alone?

117
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,320
No!

118
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,020
You wouldn't have to feel the pain of solitude
if you'd been alone to begin with.

119
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,500
You abandoned your sense of self?

120
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:43,990
No.

121
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,740
You were running away from the pain
you caused and the pain you endured.

122
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,440
You're just a coward!

123
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,380
She's far stronger than
you could ever be.

124
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,000
A coward is enough to deal
with another coward.

125
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,790
I'm enough to take you.

126
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,900
Silence!

127
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,220
You don't have the right to
call yourself her master!

128
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,780
You don't have the strength to shoulder
a student and their pain!!

129
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,670
Gintoki...

130
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,280
Let's go back.

131
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,240
To your home...

132
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,570
Jiraia! Stop!

133
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,590
Give up already.

134
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,970
There's nothing in your web.

135
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,860
This whole time, there was only
ever a pathetic little spider,

136
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,360
spinning threads into the sky while
gazing at the distant moon.

137
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,970
What are you babbling about?

138
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,630
I already knew that long ago.

139
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,560
Stop! Jiraia!

140
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,800
Yes...

141
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,070
This is how...

142
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,140
How it should be...

143
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,230
The spider will disappear
in a pool of blood.

144
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,950
It doesn't...

145
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,710
feel as good as I expected...

146
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,290
to be killed by myself.

147
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,470
I want to kill myself.

148
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,090
Jiraia, were you...?

149
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,750
Jiraia, your final prey...

150
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,140
was you yourself, huh?

151
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,350
Your goal wasn't to kill the clone
you'd raised and trained.

152
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,600
It was to be killed by your beloved
student, as yourself.

153
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,230
Th-The boss's son, is it...?

154
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,780
We met once before.

155
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,290
Have you come to avenge your
father and comrades again?

156
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,220
I lost interest in revenge a long time ago.

157
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:39,480
I have no interest in crushing a spider
who's fallen to earth.

158
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,730
...Danzo.

159
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,550
So you've done your research.

160
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,200
Jiraia the Spider.

161
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,450
Real name: Danzo Tobita.

162
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,700
Born to a country samurai in Iga and mastered
ninja techniques at a young age.

163
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,130
Your natural aptitude had people
calling you a prodigy.

164
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,970
The samurai in Iga were
fighting year round.

165
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,970
The Tobita family was one
of the larger families in Iga.

166
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,040
With such a talented son in line to take over,
its foes weren't going to stand by idly.

167
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,380
The only survivors were you
and your still young sister.

168
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,730
You felt ashamed of the skills which kept
you alive while everyone else was killed.

169
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,780
With the life of your only remaining
family hostage,

170
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:38,260
you were forced to swear fealty to your hated
enemy, what would have been your prey.

171
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,430
That gave birth to your twisted
sense of devotion.

172
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,330
Sacrifice oneself for the country.

173
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,460
You literally sacrificed your sense
of self to devote yourself to work.

174
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,670
No, you had no choice.

175
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,340
Your only escape from the hate,

176
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:05,530
sorrow, and shame of serving the ones
who exterminated your family

177
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,210
was to forget your identity and focus on mechanically
carrying out mission after mission.

178
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,240
You used that intoxication
to escape the pain.

179
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,530
However, your sister couldn't bear
seeing her older brother like that.

180
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,630
No more... No more.

181
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,150
Stop pushing yourself for my sake.

182
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,110
Dear brother, live your own life.

183
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,550
Live freely for yourself.

184
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,810
Your sister took her own life.

185
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,220
After all the prey you took,
all the pain to your body,

186
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,960
you still couldn't protect your sister.

187
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,690
To this very day, you're still
haunted by that fact.

188
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,990
And so you attempted to kill yourself
in the worst possible way.

189
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:07,390
You would become the enemy of
the beloved student you'd raised,

190
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,080
and die by her hands.

191
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,500
That was your self-inflicted punishment
for failing to protect your sister.

192
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,100
No...

193
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,300
I was just scared.

194
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,210
Just as you said,

195
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,850
I was scared of losing anything else...

196
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,170
A coward who was too scared
to bear the burden.

197
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,800
That is why I became drawn to her.

198
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,900
I wanna protect Yoshiwara and Hinowa!

199
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,350
The child who tried to shoulder
everything on that small back...

200
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,070
That was why I taught
you everything I knew.

201
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,020
I didn't want you to be hurt...

202
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,160
The way I was...

203
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,960
If we are doomed to experience
the suffering from a loss,

204
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,750
then why shoulder the
burden to begin with?

205
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,470
No need for a home or comrades...

206
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,310
But you defied my expectations...

207
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,970
You've managed to find
friends... a home...

208
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,370
You possessed a strength I never did.

209
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:32,190
The strength to not run away from the pain
you caused, the pain you endured...

210
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,510
I was scared of losing
someone else again...

211
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,810
You were headed somewhere
far away from me...

212
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,500
I...

213
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,350
...was trying to draw you back...

214
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,630
To the same fate I suffered...

215
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:59,830
In the end, I wasn't protecting
you or my sister...

216
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,930
I was only protecting myself...

217
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,770
And I became tired of myself.

218
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,500
That was all...

219
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,810
I planned on never shouldering
another burden,

220
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,550
yet I'd managed to do it again.

221
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,130
I planned on never forcing anyone
else to shoulder my burden,

222
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,850
yet I'd managed to do it again.

223
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,710
Tsukuyo, I forced you to shoulder
a worthless burden.

224
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,560
I am sorry...

225
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,670
I wish you had told me this sooner.

226
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,410
I wish you had allowed me
to share your burden.

227
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,960
We would have been able to
arrive at a different answer.

228
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,310
If the master's duty is to shoulder
the student along with their pain,

229
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,920
what is the student's duty?

230
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,180
To grow strong enough
to shoulder the master.

231
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,450
You're light...

232
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,310
So light, Master...

233
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,440
I never knew you were so light...

234
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,480
Can you see, Master?

235
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,310
Yes...

236
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,510
Yes...!

237
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,850
I can see...

238
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,820
A moon more beautiful...

239
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,540
than any...I've ever seen...

240
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,060
That's one helluva student.

241
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,310
A student's duty is to grow strong enough
to shoulder the master, huh?

242
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,090
I was always relying on my old man,

243
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,470
so I was never able to do that.

244
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,860
...Same here.

245
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:16,350
[Preview]

246
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,430
Tsukuyo-chan!

247
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,700
Let's go out and play!

248
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,120
Hey, wake up, damn it.

249
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,250
We're hitting the pachinko parlor.

250
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,210
You probably got a bunch
saved up, right?

251
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,850
["Watch Out For A Set of Women and A Drink"]

252
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,630
I'll blow it all for you.
