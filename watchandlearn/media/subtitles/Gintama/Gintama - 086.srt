[During sleepless nights, Okita does not count sheep. Instead, he counts Hijikata corpses.]

3
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,080
[Okita was awakened by Hijikata corpse number 4021. And was told he had a visitor...]

["It's Often Difficult to Sleep When You're Engrossed With Counting Sheep"]

5
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,740
I see, I see. That's wonderful.

6
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,090
The entire Shinsengumi will attend the ceremony.

7
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,070
To tell you the truth, I had given up on marriage.

8
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,350
My health isn't good, I'm an old lady, and no one would marry me. I should be grateful.

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,740
No, no, you haven't changed at all, Mitsuba-dono.

10
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,930
Pretty, polite and bright. Sogo often talked about you.

11
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,880
He's very proud of his sister.

12
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,390
Oh dear! Kondo-san, flattery will get you nowhere, you know.

13
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,220
Hey, who is that? That babe. What're they talking about?

14
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,350
Why're they laughing?

15
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,090
Didn't they just say something about marriage?

16
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,750
What?! He already has Otae-san-the son-of-a-bitch!

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,600
Shh! Keep quiet, stupid!

18
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,430
You guys don't know? That's...

19
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,730
Okita-san's sister, Mitsuba-san!

20
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,540
What?

21
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,540
The one who sends those Super Spicy Rice Crackers every month?

22
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,430
They're too hot to eat.

23
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,530
But they're so different.

24
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,790
It's hard to believe such a polite and quiet person could be Captain Okita-san's...

25
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,220
That's why they say: if one sibling is irresponsible, the other is very responsible.

26
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,860
The world balances out that way.

27
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,220
My, things are always so lively around here.

28
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,970
Oh! Sogo...you finally made it.

29
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,470
I'm sorry. I'll join you after I take care of him.

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,970
So-chan, you mustn't. You mustn't be rough with your friends.

31
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm so sorry, Sister!

32
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,010
What?!

33
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,220
You can't compete with your sister, as usual, eh, Sogo?

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,960
It's been so long, Sister. You must be tired after journeying all the way to Edo.

35
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,090
Who is that?!

36
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,360
Well, spend some time alone together. You don't need us.

37
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,470
Sogo, take the day off.

38
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,700
She came all this way. Show Mitsuba-dono around Edo.

39
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,530
Thank you very much!

40
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,710
Shall we go, Sister?

41
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,380
What was that, Chief?

42
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,430
He lost his parents when he was very young.

43
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:07,960
Since then, Mitsuba-dono has been like a mother to him.

44
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,460
Let him be today. A man needs a place where he can let down his guard.

45
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,720
Especially a guy like him...

46
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,470
who never shows weakness and has lived obstinately all his life.

47
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,100
Understood. I'll say I never saw today's Okita-san.

49
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,340
So this trip to Edo is also to meet your fiancée's family?

50
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,870
Yes. I'll be staying in Edo for a while, so we can see each other anytime.

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,720
Really? That makes me so happy!

52
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,220
Me, too.

53
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,330
If you wed and live in Edo, we can see each other anytime we want.

54
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,380
That's right.

55
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm...so happy.

56
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,700
Me, too.

57
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,830
M-Me, too!

58
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,860
[Note: Bushu was a part of the Musashi province. Which today consists of Tokyo, Saitama and Kanagawa prefecture.]

59
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,860
But I'm worried. Edo's air is filthy compared to Bushu.

60
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,770
I'm worried about your health.

61
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,270
Look at all those exhaust fumes.

62
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,720
What?

63
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,710
What? Where, So-chan?

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,250
My...what is that smell?

65
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,230
Isn't the air awful? I hope it doesn't affect your lungs, Sister.

66
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,890
Don't worry about my illness.

67
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,880
Thanks to the money you send every month, I'm getting full treatment.

68
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,480
More importantly, are you okay, So-chan?

69
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,490
Are you eating three meals a day?

70
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,570
I am.

71
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,930
Are you getting enough sleep, even when you're busy?

72
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,240
I am. I don't even have time to count sheep.

73
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,210
Are you getting along with everyone? You're not being bullied, are you?

74
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,480
Well, at times, some of the guys are nasty, but I don't give in.

75
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,490
How about friends?

76
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,990
Do you have a close friend you can confide your problems in?

77
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,860
My good friend, Gintoki Sakata-

78
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,140
What's up?

79
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,090
Hey, since when did you and I become friends?

80
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,340
Master, you don't become friends because you decide to, it just happens.

81
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,740
And friends just happen to leave, too.

82
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,080
Excuse me. Three chocolate parfaits, please!

83
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,020
We're friends, or rather, he's like a younger brother to me.

84
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,170
That's how it seems. Right, Soichiro-kun?

85
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,350
It's Sogo.

86
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,610
I like how he pays attention to details. Right, Soichiro Yagami-kun?

87
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,610
[Note: Name of Light's father from DEATH NOTE.]

88
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,740
It's Sogo.

89
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,090
My, so my younger brother made friends with an older person again.

90
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,030
You've always surrounded yourself with older people.

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,080
That's okay. I'm still an eighth-grader in summertime at heart.

92
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,790
Eighth grade?

93
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,090
[Note: Takeshi Kaga is the Iron Chef Japan host.]

94
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,090
Of all things... Were you the most stupid eighth-grader in the world, Takeshi Kaga-kun?

95
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,850
It's Sogo.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,230
Master, please. Sister has lung disease.

97
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,210
She can't handle stress.

98
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,960
I don't want to needlessly worry her. Please do a better job of playing my friend.

99
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,600
Huh? Just a minute, Sister, what're you doing? Hello?

100
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,050
Sister! That's Tabasco!

101
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,020
As a show of my appreciation for you taking care of So-chan,

102
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,970
I thought I'd show you an especially delicious way to enjoy this.

103
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,610
Do you like spicy foods?

104
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,960
Well, this is...not something that's supposed to be spicy.

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,460
So you...

106
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,700
don't like it...even though you're So-chan's friend.

107
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,600
Being friends has nothing to do with it.

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,560
You like it, right, Master?

109
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,940
What is this? I've never met anyone like this. If I'm not careful...

110
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,190
I might like it, now that I think about it.

111
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,190
Spicy foods are good for you.

112
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,470
They enhance your appetite.

113
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,640
Spicy foods have helped me many times when I was ill and had no appetite.

114
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,110
But I've already had two parfaits, so my stomach's full...

115
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,210
you know.

116
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,680
Master!

117
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,980
Get me some water!

118
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,990
She wants me to eat this without water?!

119
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,820
Sister!

120
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,480
Sister! Sister! Please say something!

121
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,260
I'm fine. I just spit out the Tabasco I just ate.

122
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,580
Nausicaa!!

123
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,250
[Note: The voice actress for Mitsuba also voiced Nausicaa from Nausicaa The Valley of the Wind.]

124
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,420
What the hell is this?! Water... Water...

125
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,550
It's a gift. "Super Spicy Rice Crackers" from Okita-san's sister.

126
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,800
Yamazaki, are you mocking me? What's with that afro?

127
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,060
Don't get angry with me. Be angry at Mitsuba-dono.

128
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,900
Vice-Chief, why didn't you go see her?

129
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,180
Chief told me about it.

130
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,090
You, Chief and Mitsuba-dono were friends back when you were in the Bushu countryside,

131
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,600
before the Shinsengumi was formed.

132
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,750
You should've let me take care of the trivial job

133
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,190
of checking out suspicious vessels and gone to see Mitsuba-dono.

134
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,230
The kind of weapons the Anti-Foreigner Faction has these days

135
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,480
are different from those of the past.

136
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,760
In these times of the Sword ban, it's not easy for civilians to acquire goods like that.

137
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm positive someone in the Bakufu government is diverting the goods through illegal channels

138
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,540
and selling them on the black market.

139
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,260
Vice-Chief. Did something happen between you and Mitsuba-dono?

140
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,160
Yes, there's something there. I just know it.

141
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,610
I knew it. There's still fire in the embers.

142
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,670
Yes. If there's a fire, it'll be big trouble.

143
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,800
Seriously? Huh? No, it's nothing like that! Dammit!

144
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,320
What're you talking about? I'll kill you. Why're you wearing an afro?

145
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,270
I'll kill you. For Pete's sake.

146
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,830
It looks like Mitsuba-dono is going to get married.

147
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,580
It's none of my businesses, I keep telling you! That afro!

148
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,910
Hey! Why're you wearing an afro? I really will kill you!

149
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,180
Her fiancé is a merchant and a millionaire. A real Cinderella story, I'd say.

150
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,110
What do I care? What's with the "I'd say"? You piss me off.

151
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,920
You only notice the useless things.

152
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,650
In the first place, why're you wearing an afro?

153
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,860
Vice-Chief, over there...!

154
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,610
I had a fun time today.

155
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,400

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,170
So-chan, thank you for everything.

157
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,780
You should stay at our headquarters, at least for today.

158
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,120
You don't have to stay over at your fiancée's place.

159
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,750
I'm sorry. There are a lot of things I need to take care of.

160
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,020
[Note: Gin is wearing a Chopper hat. Okita is wearing Usopp glasses. (from One Piece)]

161
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,020
Sakata-san, thank you very much for your company today.

162
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,660
Don't mention it.

163
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,370
All right, Sister, I'll say good-bye here. Please go on in.

164
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,690
All right.

165
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,870
Oh, So-chan.

166
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,740
How is...he...?

167
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,790
I won't let you see that bastard.

168
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,700
He left this morning on a job without saying anything.

169
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,970
He's a cold-hearted bastard.

170
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,320
Work comes first, as usual, it seems.

171
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,360
He gets me mixed up in this and then just up and leaves.

172
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,910
Forgive him. He's a selfish child.

173
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,860
It's my fault.

174
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,370
He lost his parents when he was very young,

175
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,650
so in order to keep him from feeling lonely, I indulged him while raising him.

176
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,990
He's selfish, bull-headed, and hates to lose.

177
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,220
That's why he was always a loner even back then.

178
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,090
He didn't have a single friend.

179
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,230
If he hadn't met Kondo-san, who knows how he might've turned out.

180
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,360
Even now, I'm a bit anxious. Is he doing okay?

181
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,240
You're not really his friend, are you?

182
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,470
Is he doing okay? How could he be?

183
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,270
He skips work, he's awakened his sadistic side, he's committed scandal,

184
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,750
and he's awakened his sadistic side...

185
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,490
He's no good. That shitty brat.

186
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,490
What kind of education did you give him?

187
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,310
He needs to choose his friends.

188
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,730
If he hangs around with people like me, nothing good is going to happen.

189
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,820
You're a funny man. But...

190
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,050
No wonder he's attracted to you. You're sort of similar.

191
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,770
Huh? Similar?

192
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,790
Hey.

193
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,220
What're you people doing here?

194
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,550
This mansion...

195
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,700
Toshiro-sa...

196
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,890
Hey! Get ahold of yourself. Hey!

197
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,340
She seems to finally be resting.

198
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,830
I heard she was in poor health...

199
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,820
but it appears her condition is worse that we thought.

200
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,250
But that aside, why were you with Mitsuba-san, Boss?

201
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,330
It just happened.

202
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,830
What's with that afro?

203
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,990
It just happened.

204
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,060
How did that "just happen"?

205
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,300
For you...it doesn't look like "it just happened."

206
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,530
The way she collapsed just from seeing your face...

207
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,580
Something major must've happened between you two.

208
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,060
It's none of your business.

209
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,310
Forgive me.

210
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,180
It's boorish of me to stick my nose into what happens between a man and a woman.

211
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,900
I'm really sorry.

212
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,340
Don't stop there, Boss.

213
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,410
The Vice-Chief may not look it, but he's very naïve.

214
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,630
I said it's none of your business! What are you doing here, anyway?!

215
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,900
Vice-Chief, calm down! There's an ill person right next to you!

216
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,800
Shut up! What're you wearing an afro for, anyway?!

217
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Everyone.

218
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,210
I'm sorry I couldn't do more for you.

219
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,660
I'd like to thank you for carrying Mitsuba to my mansion.

220
00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:00,220
I run the trading company "Tenkaiya." My name is Toma Kuraba.

221
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,260
He's going to become Mitsuba-san's husband.

222
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,750
I had warned her against walking around town because it would affect her health.

223
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,460
My Mitsuba has caused you all a great deal of inconvenience.

224
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,730
Your uniform...might you be members of the Shinsengumi?

225
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,710
Then you must be friends with Mitsuba's younger brother...

226
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,740
They're not my friends.

227
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,710
Sogo-kun.

228
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,710
Sogo-kun, so you came. Mitsuba-san is...

229
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,680
Well, if it isn't Hijikata-san. How odd for us to meet here.

230
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,920
How dare you come to see Sister.

231
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,390
You misunderstand, Okita-san! We came because...

232
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,140
Ow, ow, ow...

233
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,890
Sorry to bother you.

234
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,480
Hi-Hijikata-san... Are you sure about this?

235
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,610
So-chan. So-chan!

236
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,700
So-chan, it's time for practice.

237
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,930
What's the matter? You usually get up early by yourself to go to the dojo.

238
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,870
Did something unpleasant happen?

239
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,370
There's a guy who pisses me off.

240
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,680
The one who began coming to the dojo recently?

241
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,170
He's junior to me, but he's cocky and talks like we're equals.

242
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,040
Since he came, Kondo-san doesn't pay much attention to me.

243
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,900
I've had it. I don't want to go to the dojo.

244
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,800
So-chan...

245
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,360
Okita Senpai. Time for practice.

246
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,100
You! Why're you at my house?!

247
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,340
You jerk!

248
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,900
Kondo-san said to bring you.

249
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,920
Lemme go, you jerk!

250
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,660
Ow, ow, ow!

251
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,200
C'mon, lets go, Senpai.

252
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,140
You! Is this any way to treat your Senpai?! Damn you!

253
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,020
I don't like him.

254
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,500
Just a minute! Mitsuba-dono!

255
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,670
You shouldn't put on so much chili pepper!

256
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,290
How many times do I have to tell you? It's bad for your health!

257
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,970
But it's delicious.

258
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,770
But nothing! It's definitely bad for you! It's completely red!

259
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,870
Man, today's young people have a strange sense of taste.

260
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,600
Don't they, Toshi?

261
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,250
Toshi!

262
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,190
What're you doing?! What's that you're eating?!

263
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,970
It's an IT taste revolution.

264
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,490
[Note: A line from a joke by Japanese comedian Hikomaro.]

265
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,490
What're you talking about?! Who're you trying to mimic?!

266
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,090
Come on! Mitsuba-dono, you shouldn't eat that, I'm telling you!

267
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:00,230
[Note: The Social Insurance Agency (found guilty of insurance fraud) was penalized with mass firings and restructuring. This was a big news item in Japan.]

268
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,640
The inside of my mouth feels like the Social Insurance Agency coming apart.

269
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,230
That's because you can't taste anything! What's that supposed to mean?

270
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,510
The inside of my mouth is...

271
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,700
[Note: A famous phrase from the movie "Sailor Suit and Machine Gun."]

272
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,730
Doddoddoddodotto!

273
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,700
Wonderful!

274
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,840
Now who're you supposed to be?! Hiroko? Masami?

275
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,220
Either way, you gross me out.

276
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,920
I don't like him.

277
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,780
I don't like that guy.

278
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,260
Yes, he's a guy I never liked from the beginning.

279
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,300
Hijikata-san.

280
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,160
Would you mind giving me a lesson?

281
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,960
Forgive me.

282
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,230
The ceremony's been postponed because of my health again, hasn't it?

283
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,260
That's all right. Let's take our time and make you well.

284
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,820
The ceremony is just a formality.

285
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,640
I've thought of us as a couple for quite some time now.

286
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,420
Thank you, Toma-san.

287
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,030
I'll be going now since I have work to attend to.

288
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,940
You mustn't eat spicy foods, okay? It's bad for your body.

289
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,620
I know. I'm not that much of a fool.

290
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,590
Well then... I'll be back.

291
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,770
[Note: Bag says "Daioh Buffet" a spoof of the spicy snack, Dictator Habanero.]

292
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,790
Incredible. You really do anything I ask!

293
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm an Odd Jobs.

294
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,410
Don't eat too much now. It'll give you hemorrhoids.

295
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,560
Do you think I collapsed because of hemorrhoids?

296
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,420
Hey, you want something, too? I have bananas.

297
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,930
No thank you. I always carry sausages with me on secret agent activities.

298
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,170
Oh, Yamazaki-san?

299
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,860
What are you doing here?

300
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,300
Oh no!

301
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,900
Ow, ow, ow.

302
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,680
Looks like you've been sniffing around my sister lately.

303
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,250
What's the meaning of this?

304
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,750
Don't do anything more to ruin Sister's happiness.

305
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,090
I want you to stop.

306
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,010
Tenkaiya.

307
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,100
They are suspected of conspiring with lawless ronin in large weapons deals on the black market.

308
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,370
He's been selling weapons at high prices to ronin.

309
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,640
He's a black market dealer.

310
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,670
Your sister's fiancée is our enemy.

311
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,430
Does that woman know?

312
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,850
No, the Vice-Chief told me not to tell anyone.

313
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,130
Sure you are-you're telling me.

314
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,330
Ouch! But Boss, you...

315
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,350
What about me? Are you making it my fault?

316
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,350
Hijikata-san.

317
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,340
Regardless of what sort of weapons the Anti-Foreigner Faction possess,

318
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,940
all we have to do is kill them all. It's a minor problem.

319

He can't stay in business unless he's willing to deal with all sorts of people.

320
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:56,580
And you saw the kind of man he is and how deeply he is in love with my sister.

321
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,960
I'm sure he can make her happy.

322
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,180
Are you telling me to look the other way?

323
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,920
Is that how it sounded?

324
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,310
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

325
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,550
Your lesson is over.

326
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,560
We aren't finished talking yet!

327
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,650
Are you half-asleep or something?!

328
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,160
Surely you can't believe your sister will be happy with that...

329
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,710
She doesn't have much longer.

330
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,210
I'm told she doesn't...

331
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,080
have much longer to live.

332
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,670
I can't stand it.

333
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:45,910
Since I was little, she took care of me, ignoring her own needs, and even...

334
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,680
But now when she's about to grasp happiness at last...

335
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,410
At least before she dies, I want her to experience happiness like other people.

336
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,980
I'm not saying to let him go. Just for a little while...

337
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,240
Hijikata-san, Sister stayed single all this time because you were...

338
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,030
Hey.

339
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,610
The deal goes down tomorrow night.

340
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,200
Make sure your sword's in good shape.

341
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,920
I don't like him.

342
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,390
He's always like that.

343
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:27,900
He just happens to show up and swipe everything I hold dear.

344
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,200
Hijikata!!

345
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,710
Is it true you're all going to Edo to find success?

346
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,840
Where'd you hear that?

347
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,050
So-chan...he looked so happy this morning.

348
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,220
That idiot.

349
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,680
Take me...with you...

350
00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm...after all, like a parent to So-chan. If I'm not there, that child...

351
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,220
And also because...I...

352
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,630
Everyone...

353
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,110
I want to stay with...

354
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,490
you, Toshiro-san.

355
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,590
Whatever.

356
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,560
What you do is up to you.

357
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,710
I...don't like...

358
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,000
him...

359
