Commander.

4
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,600
What is it?

5
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,530
Will this be our target?

6
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,780
You've got it.

7
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,020
But how could such a house...

8
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,170
You have no idea, do you?

9
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,900
Meaning...?

10
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,970
[Note: Parody of Ramba Ral's line in the
anime series "Mobile Suit Gundam".]

11
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,970
The shabbier a house looks, the more
money its owners have stashed away.

12
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,480
Is that how it works?

13
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,690
This is such a drag.

14
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,180
Why Ramba Ral?

15
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,880
You're free to pretend
to be someone else,

16
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,330
but don't drag me into it...

17
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,430
Got a problem?

18
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,830
N-No...

19
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,560
Then get to work!

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,200
We'll finish this in five minutes!

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,880
Sir!

Ouch...

24
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,410
Huh? Ral-sama?

25
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,910
I mean, Nanba-san?

26
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,530
Huh? That's weird...

27
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,610
Nanba-san...

28
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,150
What was the meaning of that?!

29
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,880
Don't underestimate the battlefield!

30
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,090
You almost gave me a scare
for a moment there!

[Note: Parody of Jean's line in the anime

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,240
Wait, Clamp!

34
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,240

in the anime series "Mobile Suit Gundam".]

35
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,050
It's Matsuda...

36
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,350
You're being too careless.

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,470
If you don't shape up,
you'll die in no time!

38
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,930
R-Right...

39
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,940
Recite them!

40
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,800
Huh?

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,740
I'm telling you to recite the
three principles I taught you!

42
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,510
F-Forgive me...

43
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,550
Uh...

44
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,590
First!

45
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,800
Avoid contact with unnecessary
objects, to leave a minimal trail!

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,110
Second!

47
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,320
Never touch anything that
isn't worth any money!

48
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,190
And last of all!

49
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,210
You must conceal your identity.

50
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,620
That's right.

51
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,680
I have been able to survive on this battlefield
by following these three principles!

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,880
Never forget them!

53
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,660
Sir!

54
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,430
Understood!

55
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,630
That's good.

56
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,430
Let's begin!

57
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,350
There we are...

58
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,150
Wait, Acous!

59
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,150
[Note: Acous is an officer in Ramba Ral's unit
in the anime series "Mobile Suit Gundam".]

60

No, it's Matsuda.

61
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,640
Somebody's coming!

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,950
Hide!

63
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,290
Sakata-san.

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,800
Is the owner back?

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,090
I'm not sure.

66
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,800
But our only option right
now is to wait and see.

67
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,000
Sakata-san!

68
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,190
Sakata-san?

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,030
Useless Sakata-san?

70
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,240
[Note: Famous line by Char Aznable from

Is the Federation mobile
suit a m-monster?!

72
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,500
Bring it on...

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,860
Even Lieutenant Commander Char...

74
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,860
[Note: Char Aznable from the anime

75
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,730
I've come to collect the rent.

76
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Four life forms detected.

77
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,990
However, it appears that
Master Gintoki isn't here.

78
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,960
I shall return later.

79
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,160
She escaped?

80
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,850
Or should I say that she let us escape...

81
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,960
And yeah, this is a horrible mess.

82
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,410
That woman...

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
Is something wrong?

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm bothered by what she just said.

85
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,980
Huh?

86
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,020
She said there were four
life forms in this room.

87
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,130
Assuming that the first is... We can forget it.

88
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,080
The second would be Ral-sama.

89
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,930
The third would be myself.

90
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,290
There's one extra!

91
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,280
What is this?

92
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,290
[Note: Parody of the anime series
"Mobile Suit Gundam".]

93
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,290
Is this the new Federation weapon?

94
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,390
Since it's white...

95
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,390
[Note: Gundam is also white.]

96
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,120
It's a dog.

97
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,020
No, I realize that it's a
dog, but its size is...

98
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,490
Its size is not important right now!

99
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,850
No, it's pretty important.

100
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,830
Don't worry.

101
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,770
I prepared a little something
for dealing with watchdogs.

102
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,820
Here it is!

103
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,440
Th-That's...

104
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,280
Come on, puppy.

105
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,220
It's a yummy cracker.

106
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,730
Now be a good boy...

107

Cozun, you okay?

109
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,430

And I'm definitely not okay...

111
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,200
I was careless...

112
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,890
I, Ramba Ral, forgot about the
battle in the heat of battle...

113
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,410
Can we go home now?

114
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,570
Hey, Gin-san!

115
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,600
Gin-san, you here?

116

Reinforcements?!

117
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,400
Please don't notice us...

118
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,060
Gin-san...

119
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,330
What? He's taking somebody else's food!

120
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,970
I-Impossible!

121
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,400
He's using someone else's
house like it's his own?!

122
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,340
Looks like Gin-san isn't here,
so I'll leave for today.

It's Matsuda.

126
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,220
It would be difficult to imitate
his hopelessness.

127
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,730
Uh, we've already broken two
of your three principles.

128
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,630
Let's retreat...

129
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,030
What are you doing here?

130
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,880

Is Gintoki around by any chance?

134
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,780
No, Gintoki-san isn't...

135
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,980
I see.

136
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,330
Then I have no choice...

137
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,730
We haven't said anything yet!

138
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,350
Incidentally...

139
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,240
Who are you people?

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,530
Uh, well...

141
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,670
Wait, I've seen your faces before.

142
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,950
What are you talking about?

143
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,600
It must be your imagination.

144

[Call the police if you see these faces!]

146

Hmm? Is there something on my face?

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,570
It's just your imagination.

148

That's it! I know!

149
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,950

I could say in return!

169
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,830
A real screwball.

170
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,190
***key and friends...

171
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,480
Just the thought is lifting my spirits.

172
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,770
What's wrong with this house?

173
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,190
Only freaks are showing up.

174
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,430
You don't say...

175
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,380
Times have changed.

176
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,000
These people are beyond
our comprehension...

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,250
A tough bunch...

178
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,480
However...

179
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,020
I like you, kid.

181
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,420
You're able to speak your mind.

182
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,460
What? Don't tell me...

183
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,970
Yes, why don't you join us?

184
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,180
Are you serious?

185
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,870
We happen to be short on hands.

186
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,030
I am so grateful!

187
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,300
Then let us...

188
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,680
Yeah, what are you people doing
in my house without permission?

189
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,120
Eek!

190

["Welcome home."]

191
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,540
Gintoki, great timing!

192
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,750
Guess what?

193
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,940
And who are those guys?

194
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,320
We've been one-upped, Hamon.

It's Matsuda.

197
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,620
You've got good eyes.

And you've got guts.

202
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,640
I really like you.

203

204

Uh, I have no idea what you're
talking about now.

205
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,510
That's Ral-sama for you.

206
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,200
He's changing the subject without actually saying
anything so he can confuse us!

Your name's Gintoki, I believe?

209
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,740
I'll be imposing.

210
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,240
I'm sure you can support it.

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,690
Gin-san! Those people are burglars!

212
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,470
Well done, boy.

213
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,830
But you didn't win on your own.

214

You won thanks to that stalker of yours...

216
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,360
Everybody get the hell out!

217
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,970
Mi**** *****!

218
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,370
Huh? Who?

219
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,780
Shut up, baldie!

220
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,350
I definitely drank too much...

221
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,870
My head's killing me...

222
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,940
Fine. I'll wake up.

223
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,200
I get it.

224
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,580
I'll take a bath to get the alcohol
out of my system.

225
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,260
I feel so much better...

226
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,160
Huh?

227
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,370
Uh, what? What?

228
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,390
No, no way.

229
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,520
No way at all.

230
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,300
I have more hair than
the average person.

231
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,540
I've got curly hair, so this
could never happen.

232
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,330
I have so much hair that I ask
the barber to thin it for me.

233
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,830
Must be my imagination.

234
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,700
It's possible that I was pulling out my
hair when I was drunk last night...

235
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,020
Wha... Wha...

236
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,570
Wha...

237
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:29,310

What's going on here?!

240

Definitely not right here.

241

Enough with the here hear hair!

Ah, Kagura-chan.

This here is weird. This here is bad!

Here, here, here!

247
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,040
What's here?

248
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,670
Right here!

Huh? Kagura-chan?

250
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,250
Your head...

251

What are you talking about?

252

I mean, your hair...

253

I know, I'm standing right here.

such a horrific secret?!

257

Now, I can just clip them on.

258
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,120
No, that's not what I meant...

259
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,250
That must be from your dad.

260

You know, that patch that.

261

No, I'm talking about your genes.

to do with your dad there?

Good grief.

267

the that there bare.

The that there scam?

269

You can't fool this old lady by
changing a few words around!

This isn't a scam!

271

What's that?

284
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,560
You and Kagura-chan are here.

285
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,000
That's not what I mean!

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,690
I'm losing my hair!

287
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,790
What?

288
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,110
You're losing your hearing?

Yeah, somebody's definitely
losing their hearing...

290

You're pretending to lose
your hearing now?!

You're going to scam medical
expenses from us!

292
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,090
Goddamn it!

293
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,280
Cut it out already!

294
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,760
You can threaten me all you want!
This mom won't send any money!

295
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,960
Just calm down, you two.

296
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,610
I'll go make some tea.

297
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,670
Uh, Shinpachi-kun?

298
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,540
Yes?

299
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,800
What's wrong, Gin-san?

300
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,760
What, Kagura-chan?

301
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,760
Wha...?!

302
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,420
Wha... Wha...

303
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,190
What the hell?!

304
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,830
And there you have it.

305
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,110
So we're holding an emergency
Odd Jobs meeting.

306
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,360
If anyone knows of a good solution to deal
with the current situation, please speak up.

307
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,070
Yes!

308
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,380
Okay, Shinpachi-kun.

309
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,630
Something's wrong here!

310
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,450
How could we all go bald together...

311
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,130
There must be a reason for this?

312
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
Yes, you.

313
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,190
Don't use any words that directly
refer to the condition.

314
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,710
This is a delicate issue.

315
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,310
Try to be more subtle.

316
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,200
Okay...

317
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,070
There must a reason for this.

318
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,730
We should start by looking
for the cause...

319
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,300
Yep, denied.

320
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,240
Why?

321
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,480
We can figure that out later.

322
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,090
There is one thing we must do right now!

323
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,950
Defend the final line of defense at all costs
while pushing back, inch by inch!

324
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,220
Ooh! Ooh!

325
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,740
Gin-chan! Leave it to me!

326
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,060
Is this the time to be laughing
at other people?!

327
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,670
Didn't you look in the mirror?!

without the horns!

[Note: One of the characters from
Kinnikuman (Ultimate Muscle)]

331
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,490
And you look like a half-assed Atlantis!

332
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,800
That's fine!

333
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,140
Atlantis is way stronger
than Robin Mask!

[Note: One of the characters from
Kinnikuman (Ultimate Muscle)]

[Note: Akuma Choujin are a group of characters
from Kinnikuman (Ultimate Muscle)]

336
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,260
Buffaloman is the only Akuma Choujin
that isn't a side character!

337
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,520
Hey, should you really be saying that?

338
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,220
If you keep it up, I'm going
to launch these pom-poms!

339
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,030
Launch these buns into Shinobazu Pond.

[Note: Shinobazu Pond is a pond located
in Ueno Park in Tokyo.]

Why are the two of you fighting
amongst yourselves?!

343
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,460
And leave the Akuma Choujin out of this!

344
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,160
Weren't we going to work together
to find a solution?!

345
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,890
What's that, Patchy?

346
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,750
Do you have a good idea, Patchy?

347
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,030
Stop calling me Patchy!

348
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,480
It hurts my feelings!

349
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,040
What's this?

350
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,730
One of the great tools of our civilization
that your father probably used as well.

351
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,230
A scalp massage brush.

352
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,380
It stimulates the scalp to
increase hair growth.

353
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,250
We'll slowly tap our hair back.

354
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,010
Let's give it a go.

355
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,240
Ready and...

356
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,490
We're tapping our hair away!

357
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,560
What the hell is this?!

358
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,530
The impact from each tap is
making more hair fall out!

359
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,870
This isn't stimulation!

360
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,660
This isn't hair growth!

361
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,320
This is bad.

362

We'll end up like this...

365

Isn't that bad for the main character
of a JUMP anime series?

366
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,490
Your hair makes you look
like a side character.

367

We're all going to end up
like Krillin soon enough!

[Note: Bald headed character from Dragon Ball.]

369
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,250
There's no future for an anime where you can't distinguish
between characters by their silhouettes.

370
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,970
No, it might be considered original.

371
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,750
An anime where everybody
has the same hairstyle.

372
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,470
No, you can't have a show
where everybody's Krillin.

373

You might want to get off
your high horse there.

374
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,430
Considering how you're in the Krillin
position, thinning Patchy!

375
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,540
What's wrong with Krillin?!

376

[Note: Krillin's technique.]

377
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,010
He can use the Destructo Disk!

378
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,210
Vegeta was so worried that he yelled
at Nappa to get out of the way!

379
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,210
[Note: Vegeta and Nappa are both
characters from Dragon Ball.]

What's with that half-assed name?!

383
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,460
That's why it's perfect for Shinpachi.

384

You're really... You're really
hurting my feelings...

385
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,210
It doesn't matter if this
happens to Shinpachi, but,

386
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,660
you wouldn't want Krillin as Gin-san, the lead.

your own hairstyle then!
