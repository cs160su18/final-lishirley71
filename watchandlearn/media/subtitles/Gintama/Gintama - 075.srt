GinTama the anime, year two, has reached the halfway point.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,560
From the next episode on, we're headed into the second half.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,910
We somehow managed to avoid getting cancelled after half a year.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,960
Don't worry. Have the baby and the shotgun wedding will come.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,180
No, no, it was because of our efforts to "boost up" the program.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,170
What're you talking about?!

8
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,450
Thanks to us "boosting up" the program,

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,930
we received angry complaints from all over that nearly put an end to the show!

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,720
Was that how it was?

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,370
Well, at any rate, it's always better to take things on rather than doing nothing.

12
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,870
We learned that from our pressure-free education.

13
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,210
Right. You can't get hemorrhoids if you never enter the anus.

14
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,960
[Note: Spoof of "Unless you enter the tiger's den, you cannot steal her cubs."]

15
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,910
You've got that all wrong! It's "If you never enter the tiger's den"!

16
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,960
What do you mean by "can't get hemorrhoids"?!  Who even wants that?!

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,170
Anyway, what we're trying to say is that GinTama will keep on truckin'!

18
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,240
So then, what's today's story?

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,490
Gin-san's going to work really hard!

20
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,320
Well, it seems we've already used up half the year's production budget...

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,030
What?! Was it embezzled?!

22
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,980
Or did they build a Greenpia, you bastards?!

23
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:53,610
[Note: Many Greenpia health resorts were built in Japan as part of a huge government embezzlement scam.]

24
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,240
We wouldn't build such a thing!

25
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,610
The staff worked really hard and seems to have gone over budget.

26
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,410
Nothing we can do about that. We barely have enough production funds as it is.

27
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,090
Give us a bigger budget, dammit.

28
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,160
Even half of what (beep) gets would be good, Sunrise.

29

[Note: GUNDAM covered by "beep" sound. Sunrise Inc. is GinTama's production studio.]

30
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,480
What're you saying in the midst of this mess? Who're you speaking for?

31
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,100
Didn't someone say, "Don't complain about your job at home, do it somewhere else"?

32
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,690
I wouldn't know! But seriously, what're we going to do about today's broadcast?

33
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,010
Well, when the time comes,

34
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,410
we can patch together a recap episode and avoid the whole issue.

35
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,740
If we include two or three new scenes, we can fool everyone.

36
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,480
What's with this déjà vu idea?

37
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,580
What's going to happen on today's GinTama?

38
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,160
For now, let's cut to a commercial.

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,070
[As it does every half season, today's GinTama special begins with only background info. The once every half-season background info only.]

40

[What makes this a special? It's ??? special and XXX special.]

41
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,270
It's such a great song, no matter how many times I hear it.

42
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,900
What was that?

43
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,770
Otsu-chan's debut song, "Your Mother is Chome-Chome."

44
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,310
That's not what I meant.

45
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,170
That wasn't the GinTama opening number.

46
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,570
No, I think this song matches GinTama better.

47
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,620
No, it doesn't, you pop idol otaku!

48
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,200
In the first place, the opening and closing songs are tie-ups with the sponsors,

49
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,920
so we'll be scolded if we change it on our own! Mu-san will be fired!

50
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,950
Who's Mu-san? Okay, I get it. We'll do it the right way.

51

[Note: Song title translated is "Silver-Colored Sky."]

52
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,130
Okay, once more, we'll play redballoon's "Gin Iro no Sora." Okay...

53
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,310
Hey! There was something weird mixed in there! What's going on?!

54
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,500
I'm not something weird. I'm Prince Hata.

55
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,000
Why're you in there as if you're a part of the Odd Jobs family?

56
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,170
That's an insult to redballoon.

57
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,560
No, the face of this show would have to be me.

58
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,020
And the theme song should be "Love and Peace."

59

What're you talking about?! Get lost!!

60

That feels so good...

61

[Someone said "Don't Complain About Your Job At Home, Do It Somewhere Else" So let me complain. It's already been a year since this anime, which began with, "Land of the Samurai. The days when our country was called that are long past." A lot of things have happened since then. So I thought, it might be a good to time to look back, but then someone said, "Tsk, a recap episode. Isn't that slacking?" Look, it's hard work putting together an anime, so stop complaining!]

68
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,170
"Land of the Samurai." There was a time, long ago, when our country was called by that name.

69
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,800
Yes, that's how it was in the beginning.

70
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,650
It brings back memories.

71
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,490
Excuse me, I was reading the narration...

72
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,920
Hey, wait a minute. What is that? Notice how there aren't that many Amanto out on the streets lately?

73
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,850
A lot of the original concept was forgotten.

74

Stop chiming in like that. The scene's going to end...

He's a clumsy guy.

78
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,030
No, it's not that kind of scene. It's the scene where I'm bullied by Amanto.

79
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,230
Wasn't this where you knocked down my parfait because of your clumsiness?

80

That's right. That's why you're called Shinpachi.

There're no warm feelings between us anymore.

[They shared the same beginnings...]

There's a large moon out tonight.

I thought moon Princess Kaguya might come down tonight...

Takasugi, are you the one who egged on the old man?

Egged him on? Don't be ridiculous.

Thrashing about all day and all night, saying in my ear:

"Kill. Kill the enemies of my friends. Make them suffer the way we suffered."
