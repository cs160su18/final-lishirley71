Uho.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,970
Wasn't that shot sorta long for just "Uho"?

5
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,970
Daitooo!

6
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,560
Hey, you! There's no way I can approve a dirty story idea like this!

7
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,310
You can't jump into the gutter just because you ran out of decent ideas!

8
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,840
What're you tryin' to pull?!

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,970
What? You're trying to use smut to cover up a bad story, aren't you?

10
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,740
But I can easily see you've reached the limit of your abilities! You've got no depth at all!

11
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,200
Daito, please!

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,330
Please don't frustrate me.

13
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,240
My hair is falling out because of you!

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,310
I can't tell people I part my hair in the middle anymore! You hear me?!

15
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,530
Look over there!

16
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,930
That's Konishi, who was doing your job before!

17
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,690
He became an efficient editor, and is now in charge of the mega-hit manga, "One Park"!

18
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,080
When he was in charge,

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,160
"Gintaman" was a well-known battle manga and it laid the foundations for JUMP.

20
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,370
But look at you! Who the hell are you?

21
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,310
You're just some big guy, but people like you usually have small peckers.

22
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,430
But you have a big pecker! Even that pisses me off!

23
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,810
Listen! If your next survey scores the lowest, like this time,

24
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,680
Daito, you and your services on "Gintaman" will...

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,910
...no longer be needed for JUMP!

26
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,740
How did things get like this?

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,490
Why do I have to languish like this?

28
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,680
I used to be in charge of a manga about girls who played American football, called "Paishield." That was a big hit.

29
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,220
Murara Sensei always gave me his manuscripts three days before the deadline,

30
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,200
even though I didn't ask.

31
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,720
I had always scored high in reader surveys.

32
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,720
I won't let you do that!

33
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,220
But then for some reason, I was switched to another manga.

34
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,830
And now, I'm working on small-time manga like this.

35
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,160
I didn't know what was wrong.

36
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,790
I didn't want to know what had happened to me.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,930
Aw crap, "Gintaman" is still in this week's issue.

38
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,720
I can't believe it. It's jumped the shark.

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,890
I wonder what the editor is thinking.

40
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,340
No way. Even if they put some effort into it, it's hopeless.

41
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,370
It's always in the lineup before "Nyaga-san."

42
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,430
Man, I sure hate seeing JUMP slide like this.

43
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,130
While I was an advisor for "Gintaman," I made it a great battle manga that was a pillar of JUMP.

44
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,800
But it's really lost its edge.

45
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,840
Um...

46
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,250
Huh?

47
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,430
Could I ask you a few questions?

48
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,860
I see. Now you're in charge of "Gintaman."

49
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,590
What happened to that guy I called Shorty who thought he was an otaku.

50
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,220
You mean Konishi.

51
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,670
He's in charge of "One Park."

52
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,180
Wow, he is?

53
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,680
It sounds like he's really risen in life.

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,310
I remember he was always worried about getting fired back then.

55
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,860
He treated Konishi like a rookie editor?!

56
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,900
It means the rumor that someone else was the real engineer behind the success of Gintaman was correct.

57
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,100
I'm not worthy! Please help me!

["Before Worrying about the Earth, Think About the Even More Endangered Future of 'Gintaman'"]

59

You can't just call and expect me to come anymore.

60
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,640
Konishi! I'm sorry, but thank you for coming.

61
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,820
You should be thankful! I hardly have any time since I started working on "One Park."

62
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,630
You should know that.

63
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,280
All these meetings, parties, dating parties and more dating parties.

64
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,240
Mainly dating parties.

65
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,460
I've moved on from "Gintaman" - that's a manga for the masses.

66
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,430
Can you tell me how many millions of magazines "Gintaman" sold in its first edition?

67
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,580
Can you? Tell me!

68
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,390
M-Millions? Not thousands or...?

69
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,370
No. It's at least two million, like One Park!

70
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,690
More like...ze-zero point million.

71
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,750
Uho.

72
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,470
Thanks for inviting me.

73
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,870
Koishi Sensei! I'm glad you could come!

74
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,710
Hey. Long time, no see!

75
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,530
What?!

76
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,320
What's he doing here?

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,970
Well...

78
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,350
Yo!

79
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,060
Y-You are?

80
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,370
Gintoki! Now that you're here, anything is possible.

81
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,460
I owed you one, so showing up was the least I could do for you.

82
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,330
So everybody's here.

83
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,120
Hey, Shorty! Long time no see.

84
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,020
Well...Who are you?

85
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,360
What are you talking about? Don't tell me you've forgotten my face.

86
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,600
Say "Dondake?!"

87
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,160
As you know, "Gintaman" has been losing its popularity lately.

88
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,060
So I'd like to ask for your help in boosting it back up.

89
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,630
I'd appreciate your support.

90
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,600
Uho!

91
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,500
But "Gintaman" ran out of battles, it's past its peak.

92
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,120
I don't think an extension is possible.

93
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,550
You say that, but you the one who turned it into a battle manga on a par with "Dragon Bose!"

94
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,330
Listen! The manga in JUMP all turn battle manga before they end! That's destiny!

95
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,770
But it's not always like that!

96
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,600
Well, it depends on the story.

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Hey, please calm down, you two.

98
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,850
Who are you?

99
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,870
This is Koishi Sensei. He wrote and illustrated "Maison de Gin-Gin" and now works on "Asokomarudashi."

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,680
I see. I heard you worked as a cashier in your hometown for a while.

101
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,830
Anyway, what are you doing here?

102
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,240
You know, I'm a revival man, so I thought he needed someone like me to revive "Gintaman"!

103
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,130
I'm outta here.

104
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,880
Oh, no! Please wait, Koishi Sensei!

105
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,330
Uho!

106
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,970
Hey, I was just kidding. I really liked your manga!

107
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,110
Especially that report manga!

108
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,720
Hey, don't mention that one!

109
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,390
So...

110
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,560
Cheers!

111
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,930
Well, I'm kicking off our meeting about "Gintaman's" future.

112
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,970
Does anyone have any ideas?

113
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,540
I said, stop taking pieces of chicken off the skewer!

114
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,330
But you can't taste the real yakitori without the skewer. Understand?

115
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,080
Um... Any ideas?

116
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,310
Nah, this is how you enjoy yakitori!

117
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,010
I think everyone want to try all kinds of food.

118
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,470
I don't need that kind of advice!

119
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,740
Ideas?

120
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,490
Yakitori is yakitori whether it's on skewer or not.

121
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,890
What if yakitori came in a tube.

122
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,780
Then it wouldn't be yakitori anymore, would it? Tube! Tube! Tube!

123
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,730
Stop talking about the tube! Focus on the meeting!

124
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,100
So, what should we talk about first?

125
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,720
Let's first talk about what the issue is with "Gintaman."

126
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,570
All right.

127
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,160
There's no question that "Gintaman" has too much dirty language.

128
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,130
And the illustrations are crude!

129
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:28,670
Uho...

130
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,260
Well, those are just basic issues. How can I explain it?

131
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,150
In a word, what is "Gintaman" lacking?

132
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,280
That's it!

133
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,160
I know the answer. What "Gintaman" doesn't have is...

134
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,010
...sex!

135
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,010
Sex?

136
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,930
The women in "Gintaman" are all violent characters.

137
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,750
Ginta shrinks and jumps right between her giant boobs.

138
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,080
So it needs another character, some sexy woman.

139
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,600
Ah ha! "Gintaman" didn't have the ingredients for a heroine! That's it!

140
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,950
Uho!

141
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,100
All right, let's figure out the details of this heroine.

142
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,030
Uho!

143
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,780
You got any ideas?

144
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
Uho uho....

145
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,070
Great!

146
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,150
What did he say? Please translate for me.

147
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,580
He said, giant boobs!

148
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,390
Hey! Why did it take him so long just to say that?

149
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,420
And the heroine is Gintaman's childhood friend.

150
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,750
We need to have this kind of traditional setting.

151
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,270
I like a fair-skinned girl from the snow country.

152
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,620
How about a sporty girl, just like "Paishield"?

153
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,060
She belongs to the basketball club, and she wears sleeveless shirts!

154
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,890
Does that sound sexy or what?

155
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,320
That's why you can't sell a million magazines.

156
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,030
Give it a rest, you idiot!

157
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,360
You talk like you're a big man, but the real big man is Yoda Sensei! Not you!

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,090
What?!

159
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,420

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,810
This is my twin sister,

328
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,890
Mitsuko!

329
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,720
Tw-Twins?!

330
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,010
Mom!

331
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,850
Mom?!

332
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,660
Where have you been?

333
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,490
I'm sorry, Hiroshi. I didn't mean to leave ya alone.

334
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,540
Hiroshi?!

335
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm a divorcee.

336
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,610
A divorcee?!

337
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,140
Ah!

338
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,540
Why is this train flying in space?!

339
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,230
I'm an Amanto from the Planet of the Giant Boobs.

340
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,120
I came to Earth in order to find my best childhood friend.

341
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,100
What?!

342
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,970
It's time for the final battle!

343
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,470
Oh!

344
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,800
It's either them or us.

345
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,350
There can be only one winner!

346
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,390
Let's settle this once and for all!

347
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,920
Oh!

348
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,760
Um...

349
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,570
Yes?

350
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,530
Who are they?

351
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,560
We're from the Planet of the Giant Boobs

352
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,570
And they're from Planet Flat Chest. We're sister planets!

353
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,020
Planet Flat Chest?!

354
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,010
Go!

355
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,710
Mikako, here!

356
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,090
Bring it on!

357
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,140
Then, this is the final attack!

358
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,660
Once again, Ginta brings peace to the universe.

359
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,260
Thank you, Ginta. Good-bye, "Gintaman."

360
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,900
Whatever...

361
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:20,100
[Preview]

362
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,100
[Ugyaaaaaaaaaah!!]

363
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,050
[Too late!!]

364
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,040
[See you again next time!]
