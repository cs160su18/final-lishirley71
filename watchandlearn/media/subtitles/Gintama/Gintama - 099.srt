00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,840
[A video game battle to win the new Bentendo OwEe game console.]

3
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,040
[The first battle is between Kondo and the mysterious plumber, Katsuo. Who will win?! The Odd Jobs or the Shinsengumi?!]

4
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,720
Now then, everyone, what kind of show

5
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,050
will these chosen individuals give us in order to win the new Bentendo OwEe game console?

6
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,160
The first battle, the girl game challenge, will now begin!

7
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,300
["Life and Video Games are Full of Bugs"]

8
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,150
I don't care if you're Mario or Sonic--it doesn't matter to me.

9
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,300
I'm a Zony fan! I'm going to give you a thorough thrashing!

10
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,310
[Note: Zony is a parody of Sony.]

11
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,110
Whoa, what's this?!

12
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,510
The Shinsengumi is skipping all of the text without reading it.

13
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,810
He's fast! We can't tell what the story's about!

14
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,270
I told you that I know all about girl games.

15
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,790
I know exactly what I have to do, even in the new ones.

16
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,290
In this part, I'm going to meet the heroine by bumping into her.

17
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,060
[This is bad. I'm going to be late.]

18
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,070
She's going to have a slice of bread in her mouth and I'm going to see her underwear.

19
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,300
There it is!

20
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,560
Ow,ow,ow,ow,ow.

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,580
Hey! What are you looking at?

22
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,350
A swordfish?!

23
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,470
This girl is not going to school with a slice of bread in her mouth, but with a swordfish!

24
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,070
What does she eat for breakfast?!

25
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,010
What's the meaning of this?

26
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,810
The heroine of Bakiboki Memorial is quite different. She's rather eccentric.

27
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,810
She's eccentric?! This is pretty fishy!

28
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,030
Are you saying that I have to bonk a smelly girl who has a swordfish in her mouth?

29
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,690
No, calm down. No matter what she has in her mouth, she's still a girl from a girl game.

30
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,590
"A, help her. B, hurry to school." The answer is, of course, to help her...

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,290
Are you all right?

32
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,430
Not the swordfish!

33
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,490
Oh, he's gone down the swordfish route.

34
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,120
What's the swordfish route?!

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,970
From this point on, he'll become a swordfish and won't be able to feel anything or move for thirty minutes.

36
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,670
Why is there such a drastic choice right in the beginning?!

37
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,670
I-Impossible. All that data I've gathered up to now doesn't help!

38
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,180
Thirty minutes of lost time! This is quite a blow to the Shinsengumi team!

39
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,400
Love doesn't always go according to the data you've collected.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,190
Unexpected things always happen in love.

41
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,850
I won't make the same mistake.

42
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,460
Though B seems heartless, it's the correct choice.

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,090
That's terrible of you to dump me!

44
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,530
Why?!

45
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,080
There's a limit to how unexpected things can get!

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,440
I never expected her to stab me with the swordfish...

47
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,240
Love really is deep.

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,870
This isn't love!

49
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,440
What kind of world has a love story where the main character gets stabbed

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,340
with a swordfish just five minutes after meeting the heroine?!

51
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,580
Whoa! The Odd Jobs team has to start from the beginning.

52
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,460
Both players are neck-and-neck!

53
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,560
This is more than just even!

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,450
We still haven't heard the heroine's name!

55
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,360
Hey! How long is it going to take to settle this?!

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,180
Besides, it's weird to be challenging each other in a girl game!

57
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,490
Whoa! The spectators are voicing their discontent.

58
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,700
Manager!

59
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,820
Yes.

60
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,760
We shall hold the second battle simultaneously.

61
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,840
[Nobunaga's Regurgitation]
[Note: Parody of the game "Nobunaga's Ambition."]

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,840
This is the game: Nobunaga's Regurgitation.

63
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,790
A drunk Nobunaga will vomit various shapes from above the screen.

64
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,400
When you line them up in a row, the vomit will disappear...

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,830
And your opponent's Nobunaga will throw up.

66
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,100
When your screen is filled with vomit, you lose.

67
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,870
That's just a terrible version of Tetris! What's with this screen?!

68
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,750
Why are you trying to make it look like it's part of the Ambition series?!

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,150
Shinpachi, it's your turn.

70
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,330
Why me?

71
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,470
Well, just because...

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,590
Yamazaki!

73
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,970
Whoa! Bland looking players have been chosen to play this unexpectedly bland looking game.

74
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,890
That was unnecessarily mean!

75
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,610
Let the game begin!!

76
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,510
Whoa, that's gross!! Who made this game?!

77
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,250
This is a complete joke!!

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,250
Hey! Nobunaga's thrown up a lot from the start!

79
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,850
Huh?

80
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,300
Why is it like that only on my side?

81
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,590
What's the meaning of this?!

82
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,320
Why is it that only my Nobunaga is completely drunk?!

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,960
He drank quite a bit yesterday, didn't he?

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,860
[Note: Historically, Oda Nobunaga was attacked by his traitorous general Alechi Mitsuhide at Honnoji Temple.]

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,130
He probably got smashed after the incident at Honnoji Temple.

86
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,860
I don't care!! Don't drag things from the past with you!!

87
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,210
The Shinsengumi team's Nobunaga doesn't seem so drunk.

88
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,740
It's probably after the battle of Okehazama.

89
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,500
[Note: Historically, Oda Nobunaga (outnumbered 10 to 1) defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto in the battle of Okehazama.]

90
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,750
He probably had a good drink after his miraculous victory.

91
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,800
Both drank until they threw up?!

92
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,760
This is tough!!

93
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,570
I can't handle this much vomit!!

94
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,690
Shinpachi!

95
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,710
This is bad...

96
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,060
Shinpachi's begun to panic. He's lost his calm sense of judgment.

97
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,940
He won't be able to make the rows disappear like he would normally be able to.

98
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,260
In contrast, his opponent is slowly but steadily getting rid of each row.

99
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,230
The person who uses the blandest method will win this battle.

100
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,730
Shinpachi will lose if he doesn't realize this.

101
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,240
It looks like that challenge has already been decided.

102
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,840
I should say, it's been decided on this side as well.

103
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,980
I managed to set up a date with Maguko-chan.

104
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,870
With her mother tagging along? You can't really call that a date.

105
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,320
Isao-san!

106
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,590
What? What about you?! You still haven't even set up a date.

107
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,830
I did. With just the two of us.

108
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,740
What?!

109
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,960
Katsuo-kun!

110
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,460
With her mother?!

111
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,060
Why are you hitting on her mother?!

112
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,620
She said she lost her husband earlier and she's lonely.

113
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,330
This is a girl game! This isn't a soap opera!

114
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,280
This is amazing! He's ignored the main heroine and went on to seduce her mother.

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,830
Where shall we go today?!

116
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,210
This is bad. If he doesn't bonk Maguko, he cannot win this battle.

117
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,250
This is bad. Zura's love of housewives has turned problematic!

118
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,040
This challenge has been decided! Even if her mother's with her, this is a da...

119
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,360
This jar is called the Jar of Happiness.

120
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,200
Right now, you can buy it for just ten million yen.

121
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,230
Isn't that cheap?

122
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,470
He's being suckered! They see him as a sucker, not a boyfriend.

123
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,310
Furthermore, because of his choices, he has to buy the jar.

124
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,000
[What will you do?
A) Buy the jar
B) Be happy]

125
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,480
It's game over! This is harsh! He's come this far only to start all over again.

126
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,510
[You are on a tuna fishing boat.]

127
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,480
[Would you like to start from the beginning?
Yes
No]

128
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:44,060
Tsk! I messed up... She still didn't like me enough to let me ask her on a date... Oh well.

129
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,980
The other side isn't going to bonk the main heroine any time soon.

130
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,840
Katsuo-san, my daughter is in our way.

131
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,890
In order for us to live together, we have to kill her.

132
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,720
It's turned into a suspense game!

133
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,270
I'll lure her out and you bonk her off the cliff!

134
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,000
Huh?

135
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,000
Whoa! There's suddenly an indication that the main heroine Maguko is going to get bonked.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,100
Bonked? What?! Is that what they meant?!

137
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,700
Hold on a second! No way... Huh? Hey...

138
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,690
Was he going for that from the start?

139
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,360
Is that why he approached her mother?!

140
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,110
I told you that you can't predict what's going to happen in love.

141
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,170
It's over! This settles things!

142
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,390
The Shinsengumi team has taken his hands off his controller...

143
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,270
Shinpachi-kun, too bad for you.

144
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,820
I thought you would be on the same level as me.

145
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,270
It looks like I was wrong.

146
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,660
Even if you don't stand out, you've still got your straight man comments.

147
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,120
I only have badminton and kabaddi. We're of a different class.

148
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,520
You and I are of different levels of blandness.

149
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,230
It's over! This is probably it.

150
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,750
The Odd Jobs team has taken his hands off his controller...

151
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,170
What is this sound?!

152
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,170
Oh!

153
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,260
Wh-What's this?! Maguko's nipple!!

154
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,680
He's using the command to inspect it over and over!!

155
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,020
And what's this?! Vomit is being slammed against the wall between the players!

156
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,530
They're not dead yet!

157
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,190
They're getting in rapid hits!! Maguko's nipple is being poked at incredible speeds!

158
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,420
And on this side...he's using a ruler!! He's using a ruler to make rapid hits!!

159
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,930
It's bland. It's bland and unfair, but they have incredible power!

160
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,410
It's useless! Are you saying that you're going to bonk Maguko before I kill her?!

161
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,940
What are you trying to do, Shinpachi-kun? It's useless. This battle is already...

162
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,950
When Yoshimoto Imagawa attacked, Nobunaga Oda...

163
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,740
He never gave up even though he was clearly outnumbered.

164
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,960
What's this?! Maguko's face is slowly turning red!

165
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,560
Impossible! The wall between the players broke and vomit is flowing into the other side!

166
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,020
The guts to never give up or yield.

167
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,150
That's what brought on the miracle at Okehazama.

168
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,990
- It's as you say.
- It's as you say.

169
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,480
You don't know what's going to happen in love.

170
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,010
You and I are of different levels of blandness.

171
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,730
Those who don't give up easily...

172
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,140
...can't be defeated by anyone.

173
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,520
[You're Under Arrest.]

174
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,520
But that has absolutely nothing to do with this.

175
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,480
The winner is Sagaru Yamazaki!

176
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,190
The winner is Katsuo!

177
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,290
I lost kind of blandly.

178
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,010
This is kind of embarrassing.

179
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,300
Now we're one against one. The battle will be decided by the remaining two.

180
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,730
Which one do you want to play? I don't care either way. Both look interesting.

181
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,040
Both look terrible.

182
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,970
GinTama's going to end its second year, so I guess I should clean up.

183
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,360
Let's clean up the garbage and start up the third year fresh.

184
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,010
Master, for some stations, this is the final episode.

185
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,400
Huh? Is that so...

186
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,930
Now then, the battle for the OwEe is headed towards its climax.

187
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,770
The first battle was a girl game battle.

188
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,990
The Odd Jobs team won by understanding the game's strange scenario

189
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,360
that wasn't really bittersweet, but just plain sour.

190
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,130
The second battle was a puzzle game battle.

191
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,170
The Shinsengumi team won by using a bland strategy

192
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,180
that makes you ask yourself whether this is any fun.

193
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,180
The final battle will decide the victors.

194
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,920
It is a two-on-two tag match.

195
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,930
A tag match? I never heard anything about this.

196
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,810
Well, why not? I can crush three nuisances at the same time.

197
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,420
Why am I included?!

198
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,800
Bring it on. Try to crush us.

199
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,910
Strange juices might come flying from our hands.

200
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,670
The OwEe is ours. Let's settle this.

201
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,990
This is the game you will play! Dragon Hunter 3!

202
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,970
[Note: Parody of Dragon Quest.]

203
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,160
It's an online game in which you are a hero who has to defeat a dark lord who's planning to take over the world.

204
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,520
You form a party and try to complete the game.

205
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,750
This game is the OwEe's best selling point.

206
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,660
It's a new game that makes use of a virtual controller.

207
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,630
By wearing these goggles, gloves, and boots...

208
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,590
You can enjoy this game as if you were really inside the game world.

209
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,250
Whoa!

210
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,170
This is amazing!

211
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,650
It looks like we're really in the game!

212
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:56,660
[Kintoki]

213
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,570
Gin-chan, hurry this way!

214
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:56,660
[Kagura]

215
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,670
Hey, my name is wrong. It's listed as Kintoki.

216
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,300
Names can only be four characters long.

217
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,110
And you can't change you name once it's been assigned, so please tolerate it.

218
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,960
Why is only this part of it like a Famicom?

219
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:03,670
[Okita]

220
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:03,670
[Smegma]
[Note: "Smegma" is
partially censored.]

221
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,490
Hijikata-san, neither your first nor your last name fits, so I gave you a random name.

222
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,670
Hey, someone let me switch teams.

223
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,280
I'd like to say that the first person to defeat the dark lord is the winner,

224
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,490
but we don't have the time for that.

225
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,480
So the first person to defeat the group of bandits who live in the cave to the north will be the winner.

226
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,660
Begin the game!

227
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,880
All right! Let's go!

228
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,570
Wait. We'll be easily defeated at this level.

229
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,250
We need to make preparations.

230
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,180
What should we do? Shall we go buy some weapons?

231
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,520
Or should we gather some information in town, Smegma-san?

232
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,810
Hey, why is it that only my hit points are so low?

233
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,270
Why am I in the red from the moment I was created?

234
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,060
Who knows? I guess it's because you're Smegma.

235
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,260
It seems that hit points are distributed at random.

236
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,940
The Shinsengumi team is at a disadvantage from the beginning.

237
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,610
[Note: A slime is the weakest monster in Dragon Quest.]

238
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,610
You've got to be kidding me!! Even a slime could kill me in a single hit!

239
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,410
You can slowly raise your levels here!

240
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,470
I don't know how many decades that'll take, though!

Poisoned]

243
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,290
Hey! Why is it that I was poisoned from the beginning of the game?!

244
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,960
Why was my screen green from the moment I was created?!

245
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,630
This is why men are so hopeless... What woman did you get that from?!

246
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,750
It seems there are still bugs in the game because it's still being developed.

247
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,230
You've got to be kidding!

248
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,030
My hit points are going to fall to zero before I even leave this town!

249
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,040
Kagura, get me an antidote! Quickly, get me some antidote herbs!

250
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,670
Okay!

251
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,680
How pathetic. We'll be moving ahead in this game while you're fooling around.

252

Ow.

Whoa! Smegma has died.

255
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,050
It seems that he lost all his hit points when he stubbed his toe on that sign.

256
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,060
[Note: Refers to the Spelunker game, widely known to be unfairly difficult.]

257
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,060
How weak is he? What is this, Spelunker?!

258
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,770
What are you doing, Hero Smegma?

259
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,990
Give me a break. I don't want to travel around dragging this heavy coffin.

260
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,570
Wait! Hey! Take me to a church! Hero-sama!

261
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,790
It's all right.

262
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,020
I don't have the gold pieces necessary to bring you back to life at a church.

263
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,330
I'm going to defeat some monsters and make some money.

264
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,400
Hey! There aren't any monsters in there!

265
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,580
There's only the monster called desire!

266
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,220
He's been left behind! The hero Smegma has been completely left behind!

267
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,990
Meanwhile, at the Odd Jobs team...

268
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:08,330
Somewhere in this world there's a medicine that an elf made that can cure any disease.

269
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,770
According to rumors, it's in a treasure trove in the fortress city of Pales.

270
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,840
But Pales is occupied by Berias, the leader of the demons.

271
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,030
Really? Can it even cure poison?

272
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,210
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

273
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,440
Don't do it. You can't reach Pales at your level.

274
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,130
I won't know unless I try.

275
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,960
Kagura, you don't need something as grand as that!

276
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,730
I just need antidote herbs! They sell it at the item shops for ten gold pieces.

277
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,790
So you still wish to go. In that case, I have no choice.

278
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,190
According to rumors, Berias spits poison.

279
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,100
Take these antidote herbs.

280
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,280
That's it! Kagura, that's it!

281
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,540
Thank you, elder. I'm going to defeat Berias.

282
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,360
Are you listening to me?! And why are you eating those?!

283
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,200
At least use them during your fight with Berias!

284
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,190
Beria's weak spot is his head. Don't lose.

285
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,030
No! Her head is even more of a weakness than it is for Berias!

286
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,840
Gin-chan, wait for me!

287
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,410
Hey, wait!

288
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,730
He's been left behind! Someone has been left behind on this side, too!

289
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,940
Now what is he going to do?! Nothing's going to get better at this rate.

290
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,200
We're not going anywhere at this rate.

291
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,980
Hey, help me out.

292
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,180
Help you? No way. You're my enemy. Why do I have to help you?

293
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,010
You could wait in that coffin for your partner who shows no signs of returning,

294
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,700
or you could get yourself out of this situation and advance. Which do you choose?

295
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,440
I'm just a corpse. What can I do?

296
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,820
Right now...

297
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,040
Curing my poison and bringing you back to life can be all dealt with if we see a priest at a church.

298
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,330
But I need to walk more than fifteen steps to get to a church.

299
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:52,240
If I do that, I'll use up all of my hit points. I'll die.

300
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,310
So what do you want me to do?

301
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,170
In short, I have to move without walking.

302
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,370

308

But there aren't any horses... In this town...

309

There is something!

310
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,920
It's the elder! It's the antidote elder from earlier!

311
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,710
The elder wanders around until a traveler talks to him.

312
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,210
They're planning on making him pull the coffin to get to the church!

313
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,020
Go, Elder!

314
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,940
How inhumane! What un-hero-like conduct!

315
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,440
What will the elder do about the hero's unorthodox actions?!

316
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,850
Whoa! The elder isn't heading to the church at all!

317
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,180
As usual, he's moving at random.

318

that you were going to bring me back to life!

324

No, somehow I get the feeling he's headed to an area where enemies will appear.
