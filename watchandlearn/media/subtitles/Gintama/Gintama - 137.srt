They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder,

3
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,320
but by the time I realized it, he had been gone for three months.

4
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,040
Even going into the third year of this series, I've only been in three episodes.

5
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,170
Am I just imagining that I'm in the opening credits?

6
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,320
I can't take it anymore. So I figured out a way to make him one with me.

7
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,420
I mean, to get him to pay attention to me.

8
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,260
So I...

9
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,440
Welcome!

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Excuse me. I've got a coupon for a free cake here.

11
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,390
[Chocolate]

12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,250
Can I use it here?

13
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,760
Yes. Of course. Choose up to three of these cakes here.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,860
Ooh. This looks good, too. Which should I choose?

15
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,630
This cake is our newest creation.

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,740
Huh? Really? Hmm...

17
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,880
Choose me!

18
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,120
Cake and me, the things that you love, have become one and are right before your eyes!

19
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,650
What do you think? Should we also become one?

20
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,200
Oh, no, I didn't mean it like that. No, I did also mean it like that.

21
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,530
Now quickly.

22
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,920
Eat me all up.

23
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,030
Umm...Just give me a moment.

24
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,140
That is our most popular cake.

25
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,540
What? Really?

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,140
What's up with that?!

27
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,310
"A moment"? How long is that?! How long are you going to make me wait?

28
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,750
Yes, endure it, Ayame.

29
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,680
This is a type of role-playing.

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,570
It's one of his time-consuming, sadistic tricks designed to torment a pig like me.

31
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,070
Then, when he can't take it anymore...

32
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,370
Sorry to keep you waiting.

33
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,470
I always eat the main dish last

34
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,850
How wonderful!

35
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,890
Gin is definitely the only one who can push my buttons!

36
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,590
Shut up!

37
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,520
Thank you very much.

38
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,640
Gi...

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,720
Gin...

["99 Percent of Men Aren't Confident in Confessing Their Love"]

41
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,430
What's wrong? Why are you sighing?

42
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,650
Sighing? That's called exhaling.

43
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,760
Rough fantasy abandonment just turns me on.

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,250
Anyway, aren't you the one who's sighing?

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,360
Sighing?

46
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,570
I'm so satisfied by my fulfilling, love-filled days, that was just a burp of happiness.

47
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,380
That stinks.

48
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,850
It's great!

49
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,260
It's a joy to help the one you love.

50
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,180
You can feel each other's love.

51
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,990
You've got thirty seconds to go buy Baagen-Daaz for all the staff.

52
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,370
I'll be right back!

53
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,110
You're just a slave.

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,300
You're probably too persistent, aren't you?

55
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,790
Women are creatures who want a chase.

56
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,830
They like men who are uninterested in them!

57
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,610
Men are also creatures who want a chase!

58
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,650
For example, cabaret-club hostesses or the class idol.

59
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,320
Besides, you say you're into in fantasy abandonment, but, in reality, he's just ignoring you!

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,320
Shut up! I'm still happy!

61
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,380
I'd even like to share my happiness with you!

62
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,810
Then you might be able to attain your impossible love!

63
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,840
Try it if you can!

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,740
I'm also more than happy.

65
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,300
I could even become your love cupid!

66
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,620
Why is this masochistic weirdo so confident?

67
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,200
No, I'm happier having Otae rely on me rather than

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,080
having my love ignore me, like hers!

69
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,470
What's with this gorilla stalker's triumphant smile?

70
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,730
No, I'm happier than he is because I'm more human!

71
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,460
Hey, if you're gonna go as far as to say that, then let's settle things to see who's happier.

72
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,850
"Settle things"?

73
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,620
Yeah. Whoever can lead the other's love to success.

74
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,060
I see... The one who wins is truly filled with happiness.

75
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,530
I challenge you.

76
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,110
Bring it on.

77
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,420
Oh...

78
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,110
Oh.

79
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,040
Sarutobi!

80
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,390
It's been a while, hasn't it, Otae?

81
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,240
Actually, I've heard something interesting.

82
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,490
Haven't you heard?

83
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,960
That gorilla stalker who's been following you

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,800
has developed an interest in someone else.

85
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,610
No way! Kondo?!

86
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,610
He's already received a love letter from her.

87
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,690
Why do you have it?!

88
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,090
And why is it in code?!

89
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,920
It seems she's from some far-off country.

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,230
Translated, it says, "I love you so much that I'm embarrassed to appear in front of you.

91
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,170
I'd like to bury you in a hole."

92
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,720
It's "I'd like you bury myself in a hole"! The meaning's changed!

93
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,000
I also found something that I believe was a gift to her.

94
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:44,840
Here it is.

95
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,930
Why a collar?! What kind of woman is she?!

96
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,120
She's a bestial woman.

97
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,470
She's perfect for him, since he's half gorilla anyway.

98
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,380
Yes, women are creatures who want a chase.

99
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,060
It's only natural that she'd want to go after a man who leaves her.

100
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,150
I've won this battle!

101
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,000
Wh-What?!

102
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,280
What the hell are you doing?!

103
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,310
I know you've been following me! Why are you acting surprised?!

104
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,290
You couldn't be more obvious!

105
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,050
Well, Sakata, fancy meeting you here.

106
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,760
Hey, you're not listening to me, you half-gorilla.

107
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,740
What is this?

108
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,820
I don't remember doing anything to warrant getting stalked by a man.

109
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,930
Oh! Speaking of stalkers, that four-eyed assassin

110
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,120
has recently fallen for another man.

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,620
Well, I don't know who it is, but... he's alive.

112
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,250
What is he? A mole cricket? An earthworm?

113
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,310
Men are creatures who want a chase.

114
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,190
If the person who was chasing him turns away from her, he's sure to go after her.

115
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,140
I've won this battle!

116
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,770
[Hijiki Dango]

117
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,450
So how did you do?

118
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,880
That Odd Jobs guy was easy.

119
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,990
Well, she's a stalker, but she wears glasses, she has big breasts,

120
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,000
she wears glasses, she's sort of considerate, and she wears glasses.

121
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,340
That's it, yeah?

122
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,650
Huh? Gin thought of me in that way?!

123
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,470
Now, now. Don't settle for that.

124
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,000
In the end, he still gave up on you.

125
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,400
So how did you do?!

126
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,340
It was easy. Otae said...

127
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,520
Is that so?

128
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,420
Tell her that I recommend Kondo. He's really good person.

129
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,280
No way! Really?!

130
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,500
That was the first time she ever talked about me like that!

131
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,690
But your happiness aura still isn't very impressive.

132
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,920
In the end, she recommended you. You're still at Yamcha level.

133
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,670
I'm not Yamcha! I'm at least Master Roshi level!

134
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,160
At best, you're a turtle-headed hermit.

135
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,310
What did you say?!

136
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,150
But I still haven't clinched victory in this battle.

137
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,930
In order to win, I need to plan something more direct.

138
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,750
That's it!

139
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,000
I've got a direct and decisive plan.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,220
Will you join me, assassin?

141
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,040
I said that we should just act as if we're going out with each other, but...

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,500
what's with that outfit?!

143
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,990
I'm trying to draw attention to the fact that we're supposedly a stupid couple that's attached to each other.

144
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,810
We really are attached to each other!

145
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,460
But it's definitely not a bad plan.

146
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,860
Women are creatures who want a chase.

147
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,730
If someone whose presence they took for granted really disappears...

148
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,380
they'll realize how important that person was.

149
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,570
That's right!

150
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,970
But you've made one mistake.

151
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,430
It's not just women, but men, too.

152
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,130
Huh? Really? I'm glad for the two of you.

153
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,290
Huh? Well...

154
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,490
Congratulations, Sarutobi, Kondo.

155
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,110
Umm... Well... Huh?

156
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,070
What do you two think about living here?

157
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,620
Hey, hold on...

158
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,620
I've got to let everyone know.

159
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,120
Hold on! Wait!

160
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,840
Here. In celebration.

161
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,740
I feel kind of stupid.

162
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,160

00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,310
I extended into real estate and stocks and tons of cash comes in every day.

326
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,090
But I feel kind of sad.

327
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,910
I have money and my life should feel fulfilling... But there's a hole in my heart...

328
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:22,660
I always end up remembering my time with you...

329
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,460
I had no money. I had nothing.

330
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,490
But life seemed to have meaning to it.

331
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,090
Everything shined...

332
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,250
I felt encouraged just when I thought

333
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,340
of the smiles children had when they got presents...

334
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,940
Can we run once more, gramps?

335
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,480
You can, can't you? It's easy, isn't it, gramps?

336
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,650
After all this time...

337
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,590
Say, what do you want for Christmas?

338
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,010
I want a Crucian carp set!

339
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,240
What are you talking about? There is no Santa!

340
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,630
No! I'm going to have my dad buy it.

341
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,900
I see.

342
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,950
That's right. There is no Santa anymore.

343
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,520
What are you talking about?

344
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,940
Nowadays, people, both adults and children, don't believe in the things of dreams.

345
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,480
How can I run in such a world?

346
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,470
How can I fly?

347
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,350
Besides, I already sold my sleigh.

348
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,260
A sleigh...

349
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,770
A simple request!

350
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,340
Get on.

351
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,740
What are you talking about?!

352
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,980
Its former residents are still in it!

353
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,680
I told you two years ago that he's a fairy called Cardboard Box O-san

354
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,360
No way. This is just like two years ago!

355
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,180
I can buy a sleigh.

356
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,330
I have money, so I can get one no problem.

357
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,900
Look, your bad, wealthy habits have come out.

358
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,100
That's not good.

359
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,260
You've got to work hard when you don't have any money.

360
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,500
Why a bicycle-drawn cart again?!

361
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,510
It's not a cart. It's my sweet home!

362
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,340
Oh, sorry.

363
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,090
It doesn't matter if it's a sleigh or a cart, does it?

364
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,640
It doesn't matter what you use. All that matters is what you give.

365
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,490
But...

366
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,860
Right now, I'm in debt and I'm a barker for a cabaret club...

367
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,310
Does a ruined man like me have the right to grant children their dreams?

368
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,920
Stop acting so cool.

369
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,750
You suffered and suffered and now you realize that being a Santa is what you're good at.

370
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,510
You you know what you want to do now.

371
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,580
Aren't you glad?

372
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,090
You want to be a Santa from the bottom of your heart, right?

373
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,910
Mom! Get a hold of yourself, Mom!

374
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,930
Mom! Are you all right, Mom?

375
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
What's wrong?

376
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,400
Mommy...Mommy...

377
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,790
Little girl!

378
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,220
You're Yuri. You asked for a kendama and a kind mother.

379
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,230
She's going to give birth!

380
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,430
This is bad!

381
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,930
Shall we call an ambulance?

382
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,000
Mom!

383
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,840
No. We don't have time to be waiting for an ambulance!

384
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,790
I'll take her!

385
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,600
Ben, let's go!

386
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,950
All right!

387
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
Fly!

388
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,650
All right!

389
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,230
Mommy! Mommy!

390
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,760
It'll be all right!

391
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,920

Thank you so much.

Who knows what might have happened if you weren't there...

395
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,560
Thank goodness, you gave birth to a cute baby.

396
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,780
What do you mean by that?!

397
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,490
Hey, we shouldn't stay too long...

398
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,690
Yeah.

399

Wait, Santa!

400

Thank you.

401

Thank you for giving me a cute brother and a kind mother.

402
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,520
Of course.

That's right!

They haven't read Shinpachi's letter.
