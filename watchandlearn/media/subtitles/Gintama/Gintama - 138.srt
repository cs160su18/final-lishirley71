00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,760
Welcome home, Ojiki!

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,510
Hey, where's sis?

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,540
She's waiting upstairs.

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,560
Papa! Papa!

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,070
What?! Tanaka?!

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,130
You idiot! Don't just stand there! Bring me the head of the guy who did it!

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,480
S-Sorry.

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,410
You little turd.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,980
Sis, allow me to be of assistance.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,150
You two! Go that way!

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,560
Yes!

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,220
Hey!

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,310
Why are you sneaking around? Show yourself!

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,170
That psychogun attached to your arm... you're the Black Dragon, aren't you?

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,200
Do you know why they call me Stainless Boy?

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,980
That's because my body is made of a specially armored stainless steel.

18
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,790
That psychogun on your arm is useless.

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,890
That's right. I'm the Black Dragon.

20
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,680
The man with a gun for a right hand.

21
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,360
In a mad dash to kill me, they've done everything they can.

22
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,600
In front of me, somebody dies all the time.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,300
Someone always fires a gun, but you know,

24
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,140
I really got sick and tired of that too much stupid days.

25
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,910
I threw away my face at all, and got rid of my past,

26
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,870
too the silly, funny, and bloody days...

27
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,930
[Thanks for everything this year. Here's wishing for a prosperous new year! From Snack Otose]

28
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,830
What? It's not dondake? I was sure it would win.

29
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,600
[Snack House Otose]

30
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,190
the Space Buzzword Grand Prix this year.

31
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,270
It won in Edo, but, it's not even in the top 50. Space is big.

32
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,060
Umm... What was fourth place? Smegma Prince?

33
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,060
Ah. This year we still have that senseless "prince" boom.

34
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,420
Oh. Huh? "Prince" is at number eight.

35
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,350
I believe number four is "Where are the EXLE CDs?"

36
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,470
What is that? Is that really popular?

37
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,960
Third place is "My grandson asked me."

38
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,530
Why are fourth place and third place connected?

39
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,780
It sounds just like an old lady is trying to get an EXLE CD for her grandson.

40
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,730
That grandson should buy his own CD.

41
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,680
There's no way that an old lady would know about EXLE.

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,510
Oh, yeah, "There's no way an old lady would know..." was number thirteen.

43
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,640
Why are comments included in the ranking?!

44
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,780
Number two is... Huh? I can't remember.

45
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,600
I think number one is, "B'z are gonna be all right."

46
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,150
Don't give up!

47
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,570
Why did you give up and buy something else?

48
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,110
Besides, B'z and EXLE are completely different musically!

49
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,180
What in the world happened at number two?!

50
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,900
Shinpachi, this is what happens when you yell.

51
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,290
Why is it my fault?

52
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,720
What is it? Is there an EXLE CD?

53
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,410
A photo came out from behind the picture frame.

54
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,900
It looks like a pretty old photo.

55
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,380
Who is she?

56
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,840
Could it be?

57
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,630
It's his ex, isn't it?

58
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,100
Huh? You think so? Yeah?

59
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,620
There's no mistake.

60
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,830
That lascivious air about them...

61
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,020
They must've had a wet, sticky, lusty relationship.

62
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,650
It's pretty effeminate of him to cling to this picture. Isn't it?

63
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,080
Let's put it back now! Put it back, quickly!

64
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,880
We've got to put it back before Gin comes back!

65
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,690
He'll freak if he finds out we saw this.

66
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,740
This makes a mother catching her son doing something nasty seem pale in comparison!

67
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,980
Quickly! Quickly!

68
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,390
Hey. I bought some detergent.

69
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,520
Gin's here! Hurry! Kagura! Quickly!

70
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,380
Shut up!  I'm putting it back now.

71
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,820
Oh! W-Well...

72
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,710
Gin! It's not like that! Umm... We didn't see anything!

73
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,280
We don't know anything!

74
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,960
Why are you still dragging that around?

75
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,450
That woman probably doesn't even remember you.

76
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,890
K-Kagura?!

77
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,990
Hey. What a great little piece of nostalgia.

78
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,680
Where did you find this?

79
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,530
Well, while we were cleaning...it came out from behind the picture frame.

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,440
I see. So that's where it was.

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,700
Huh? You seem kind of indifferent... But, huh? What is that? Who is that?

82
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,910
That...

83
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,610
What is it? It's one of the Odd Jobs.

84
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,730
Huh? "It's one the Odd Jobs"? But we're the Odd Jobs.

85
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,590
Now we are.

86
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,810
"Now we are"?

87
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,120
If anything, we're the new Odd Jobs.

88
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,390
This was a prototype.

89
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,310
A p-p-p-prototype? Hold on. You never told me about that!

90
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,290
Huh? Didn't I tell you about it?

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,100
["Let's Talk About The Old Days Once In A While"]

92
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,980
Basically, this was before you joined. It was around the time when I set this all up.

93
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:25,700
It was a time when I had, not you, but different friends.

94
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,660
You said before that you had done this by yourself.

95
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,190
Did I?

96
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,110
When we met, you were definitely by yourself.

97
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,560
In this business I do whatever people ask me to do.

98
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,020
Setting up a new premise is problematic.

99
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,520
We've already got 137 episodes to deal with.

100
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:53,270
Anyway, I basically work alone. But for short periods of time, I did it like that.

101
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,560
Inoue and Okuda also had times like that.

102
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Never heard of 'em. Who are they?

103
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,840
Anyway, a lot happens to adults.

104
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,190
It feels kind of refreshing.

105
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,060
I never knew we had more senior predecessors.

106
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,700
Senior? It's not that special.

107
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,490
It was just a temporary arrangement. We split up immediately.

108
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,710
Huh? Then does that mean that that sensual beauty was also a member of Odd Jobs?

109
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,550
What do you mean, "sensual?" That's gross, Shinpachi.

110
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,140
She's wasn't really a member, sort of a semi-regular.

111
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,280
The closest comparison now would be Catherine.

112
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,600
Catherine?!

113
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,730
This is Catherine?

114
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,100
Well, she used to work at Granny's place.

115
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,390
She'd come to clean up once in a while.

116
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,760
She'd help with the Odd Jobs office work and accounting.

117
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,580
She was a good woman who'd look after you. Unlike Catherine.

118
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,980
How nostalgic...

119
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,000
Catherine's job was a lot better back then, wasn't it?

120
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,450
Well, it was the good old days.

121
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,160
Tell us more. What about us? Who filled our positions?

122
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,480
I want to know. They probably don't compare to us, though.

123
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,420
The Odd Jobs hasn't changed at all. We worked in trios.

124
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,390
Oh? Trios?

125
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,400
They were useless lumps just like you.

126
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,940
Oh, here. I have a picture. Here.

127
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,700
This guy had your job.

128
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,980
Kanemaru, a four-eyed good-for-nothing whose job it was to make witty jokes.

129
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,240
Kanemaru's totally high-end!

130
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,640
What is this?! He doesn't look like a "Kanemaru" at all!

131
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,070
He's a "brother"! He looks like he's straight out of downtown LA.

132
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,150
Naw, he sucked. He had a psychogun for a right hand, but he couldn't use it at all.

133
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,380
I bet he could use it! No matter how I look at it, he had to have been able to use it!

134
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,450
Kanemaru worked as a no-account waiter.

135
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,160
He lived an uneventful life.

136
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,260
But when he got into a virtual simulator to unwind he remembered his true past.

137
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,130
What's with the expository tone of voice?

138
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,950
Besides, we already know that setup. We know it really well!

139
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,530
Kanemaru was so feared in the underworld that his nickname was Black Dragon.

140
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,130
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

141
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,620
Fuck you!

142
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,810
Indeed, his fighting abilities surpassed everyone else's.

143
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,670
After that, he ended up working here.

144
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,960
But I don't really understand what "after that" is referring to. What is "that"?

145
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,240
Well, a lot of things. This and that.

146
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,540
But what's "this and that"?

147
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,000
Adult stuff. You don't want to go there.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,320
Oh, okay. Sorry. So how was Kanemaru?

149
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,000
He wasn't bad. What sucked were...his witty jokes.

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,830
Ah... I see.

151
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,110
It's just not the Odd Jobs without any witty repartee.

152
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,630
Well, he was foreigner. What could you do? There's a language barrier.

153
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,550
Yes. I remember he surprised me once when we were at a family restaurant.

154
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,140
We ordered lasagna and chazuke, but...

155
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,580
Thank you for waiting.

156
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,930
The waiter gave me the lasagna

157
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,270
and gave him the chazuke.

158
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,780
Huh? She gave the chazuke to Kanemaru?

159
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,840
Yes.

160
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,490
So I had a lasagna that Girolamo or Lana would love.

161
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,370
Is everything all right?

162
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,950
Aw... You better say something about that, Kanemaru.

163
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,350
Read the situation. Say, "Do I look like I eat chazuke?!"

164
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,040
Oh, shit! Oh my god!

165
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,230
It's no good. He's only saying western words, like "fuck you," or "oh my god."

166
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,210
It's impossible for a foreigner.

167
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,890
Shinpachi is the best at making witty comments.

168
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:48,250
Miss, I asked fer ume chazuke, not sake chazuke.

169
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,530
He can speak Japanese?!

170
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,990
I'm sorry. I'll exchange it.

171
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,980
Hey, Kanemaru is the one who's ordering chazuke!

172
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,310
No biggie. Just be careful the next time.

173
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,740
That aside, why are you eating lasagna? It's usually the other way around!

174
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,150
Ah... Japanese people love chazuke the most!

175
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,170
Hey, who am I calling Japanese?!

176
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,160
That's top class! It's a well-made remark.

177
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,910
It's like a witty comment from Kansai itself!

178
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,460
Kanemaru was from the Kansai region.

179
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,530
His grandmother was Japanese so he was into Enka and Dotonbori.

180
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
What, is he Jero?!

181
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,230
Kamemaru always used to say, "I'm not a Japanese person. I'm a Kansai person."

182
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,100
No such Kansai person exists. He has a psychogun!

183
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,200
I've lost all confidence.

184
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,920
He's got me beat coming and going.

185
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,290
Well, anyone could fill your position if he wanted to.

186
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,600
There wasn't anyone in my place, was there, Gin?

187
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,040
There was someone who filled the Kagura position.

188
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,740
What?!

189
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,440
Here. The dazzling Ikezawa.

190
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,330
He's almost exactly like the other guy!

191
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,510
How is he dazzling?!

192
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,960
Just what the hell do you think my job here is, you naturally-wavy-haired bastard!

193
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,420
I'll squirt ya with juice from this tangerine!

194
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,410
Ow! It got in my eye.

195
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,990
And why the hell are all of your people armed with psychoguns?!

196
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,710
Oh, sorry. My bad.

197
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,160
This is Furuhashi. He filled the Sadaharu position.

198
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,390
This isn't getting any easier!

199
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,150
Furuhashi was like a mascot for us.

200
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,530
He had a very charming personality. His only flaw was his monstrous appetite.

201
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,080
But he was a cute mascot.

202
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,560
I don't want a mascot like him. He isn't all that different from Kanemaru!

203
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,830
Sorry. My mistake. Here's Kagura's spot.

204
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,960
The dazzling Ikezawa.

205
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,290
She's pretty cute. Aren't you glad, Kagura?

206
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,790
She's not all that. She's just female.

207
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,100
You have no regard for my position if you think she could stand-in for me!

208
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,570
No, I'm not talking about her.

209
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,010
She's the same thing!

210
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,130
She just has a sake bottle instead of a psychogun! Gimme a freakin' break!

211
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,060
How is this me?!

212
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,350
Calm down. Ikezawa used to be a housewife.

213
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,360
But her husband began cheating on her at work and never came home.

214
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,450
So she became a drunk. After that, she'd always say "uh-huh" just like Kagura.

215
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,050
Alcohol! Alcohol, please!

216
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,510
Hey! Alcohol, please.

217
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,270
What kind of use of "uh-huh" is that?!

218
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,080
Don't worry. Ikezawa doesn't drink anymore.

219
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,400
She recovered and she's getting alimony.

220
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,870
What about that?

221
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,870
Anyway, what kind of Odd Jobbers are these people anyway?!

222
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,220
It's just full of Kanemaru's! It wouldn't sell.

223
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,650
They'd never turn this into an anime.

224
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,370
Really? When Hedoro was on the cover, they said it wouldn't sell.

225
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,380
But when Kanemaru was on the cover,

226
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,610
we sold [censored] thousand copies of the first print.

227
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,560
It's totally copacetic. Even the anime...

228
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,380
You bastards! Do you see this old man?!

229
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,860
That's my pickled seaweed!

230
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,780
Hey... What are you eating?!

231
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,020
Perhaps something like that?

232
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,080
I don't want to see my sister off while she's in tears.

233
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,660
Gin, what'll we do if she really is in love?

234
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,150
We'll be the villains.

235
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,720
You're used to being a villain, aren't you?

236
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,890
And also getting in people's way... Kanemaru, remember that.

237
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,060
We're not allies of justice, or your sister's allies.

238
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,410
We're your allies!

239
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,250
Something like that.

240
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,650
Take a look at this.

241
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,680
Her, too?!

242
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,270
Wait!

243
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,470
Tama...

244
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,270
Gin...

245
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,010
You can't tell the difference.

246
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,060
There's a huge difference!

247
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,600
Don't say that. They're your seniors.

248
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,760
They're my precious friends with whom I shared countless adventures!

249
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,710
Look at this. This is when we caught the phantom thief that was terrorizing Edo.

250
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,370
That was really tough.

251
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,630
This is when we took down a killer. The morning sun sure was bright.

252
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,910
This is when we caught a purse-snatcher.

253
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,980
That old lady was in tears when we brought her stuff back.

254
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,100
This is when we beat up a pervert. That lady was really grateful.

255
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,310
This is...What was this? That was the time we did something.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,270
This is... I kind of forgot.

257
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,750
Hmm... I'm not sure.

258
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,190
They never bonded with you at all!

259
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,790
They were just wandering around! They didn't warm up to you at all!

260
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,890
That's not true.

261
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,600
Kids like you might not understand this,

262
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,670
but adults leave this much space between themselves when they associate with each other.

263
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,220
They don't get all touchy, and taking a piss together is off limits.

264
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,170
Those two are getting pretty touchy behind you!

265
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,980
Kanemaru and Ikezawa totally have a thing for each other.

266
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,300
Looks like those two are bonding,

267
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,270
leaving Gin by himself.

268
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,230
You've become like Parc Manther from Glope.

269
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,470
You're the most Japanese, but you turned into Parc.

270
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,710
Shut up!

271
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,890
I'm not Parc Manther! I lead the Odd Jobs.

272
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm [censored]!

273
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,080
No. I've never seen such a lonely [censored].

274
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,070
Don't be silly. I'm [censored].

275
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,200
I don't feel pathetic at all!

276
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,120
I actually supported their relationship. But as the director of Odd Jobs...

277
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,170
I warned them not to get wrapped up in their relationship and ignore their work.

278
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,690
Well, young people these days just go to pieces when you just slap them around a bit,

279
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,020
so before I knew it, they disappeared.

280
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,920
They didn't just happen to disappear!

281
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,510
You still have some terrifying pictures! Black Dragon is drowning here!

282
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,000
What are you doing?!

283
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,400
We were gonna wrap this up all nice, but it's been filthy all the way through!

284
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,140
Don't you have even one or two nice stories?!

285
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,560
Now I know that Odd Jobs doesn't have anything good in its history!

286
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,310
If we leave it up to him, he'll take straight down the road to destruction!

287
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,970
Let's handle the Odd Jobs without him.

288
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,100
We're going to make history!

289
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,950
It's the supporting characters who keep a series afloat, not the main character!

290
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,370
That's right. The main character is just an ornament.

291
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,230
People in high positions don't understand that.

292
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,510
Ow, ow, ow. They really kicked my ass! Don't they know how to hold back?

293
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,910
What is it?

294
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,270

I don't care if you're a hitman or a hit-maker.

How long are you going to act like a cool guy, huh?!

306
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,750
Katana, samurai?!

307
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,560
Blah, blah, blah! Just look at this.

308

spilled on the floor!

310
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,150
He was called a samurai, but he was too wild for the norm.

311
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,600
Even though he was called a hoodlum,

312
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,580
this man had eyes that were sharp with seriousness.

313

That was my first impression to the "otoko."
