00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,100
Kyubei Yagyu took Otae away.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,250
In an effort to rescue her, the Odd Jobs trio, led by Shinpachi,

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,990
and three of the Shinsengumi, led by Kondo, challenged the Yagyu clan.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,590
But, the Four Aces of the Yagyu clan and their leader, Kyubei Yagyu, stand in their way.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,030
In order to take Otae back, they must take on the Yagyu in a six-on-six game of survival.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,800
That was too easy!

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,930
Hmph.

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,340
I was waiting for that.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,360
Now!

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,250
The strategist is beaten by his own strategy!

12
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,980
[Kagura and Okita together gave the Kodokan team a victory over Nishino.]

13
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,060
[The second match is between Hijikata and Kitaoji. A match between a mayo maniac and a ketchup freak.]

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,100
Okita-san...

15
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,330
My god...

16
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,900
Sogo... Not Sogo...

17
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,440
This is terrible. It's snapped in two.

18
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,380
They must've struck simultaneously...

19
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,710
I can't see how he could've defeated this man on a broken leg.

20
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,550
He probably defeated him, and then when he was exhausted...

21
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,770
It can't be!

22
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,860
There's no way Sogo would lose...

23
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,430
Right, Sogo?

24
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,160
You were the quickest study at our dojo.

25
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,510
You surpassed everyone in no time at all.

26
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,120
You're teasing me again, aren't you?

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,920
I won't fall for that.

28
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,640
Right, Sogo?

29
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,510
Answer me, Sogo!

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,420
They won't get away with this.

31
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,200
They won't get away with this! I swear!

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,160
Was it necessary to go this far?!

33
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,750
Wasn't it supposed to end once the plate was broken?!

34
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,490
Those bastards must enjoy...tormenting people!

35
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,210
Their cell phone...

36
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,120
Maybe they left evidence of who did this to Okita-san...

37
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,910
Dammit!

38
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,460
Who the hell did such a cruel thing?!

39
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,520
Sogo, I'll get revenge for you, I swear!

40
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,980
Right, Shinpachi-kun?

41
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,100
Dammit! Who did this to Okita-san?! I have no idea!

42
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,080
If I ever find out, I'm seriously going to kill the bastard!

43
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,730
Yeah! I'll kill the bastard, too!

44
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,070
Huh? Why're you perspiring?

45
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,930
It's hot in here. Turn on the air conditioner! Those dummies!

46
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,470
Come on out! Where'd you go?! We're avenging Okita-san!

47
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,890
Forgive us. We didn't know you were having a meal.

48
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,120
Wrong room.

49
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,280
What the hell are you doing?!

50
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,090
["People Who Are Picky About Food Are Also Picky About People, Too"]

51
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,320
Can't fight on an empty stomach.

52
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,190
Care to join us?

53
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,610
I'm not eating a meal prepared by the enemy!

54
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,790
Hijikata-san, what're you doing relaxing and taking it easy?

55
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,700
Let's have the three of us take him out!

56
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,170
Hey! Don't interfere.

57
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,320
Hijikata-san!

58
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm eating fried rice.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,610
You're having fried rice?!

60
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,590
Pass the ketchup, will you?

61
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,940
Hm, this?

62
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,750
Hey, what's going on here?

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,810
There's no tension or anything here.

64
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,730
Ordinary people wouldn't understand.

65
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,550
The match has already begun.

66
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,180
Samurai do things their own way, be it a meal or even how they hold their chopsticks.

67
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,140
Everything they do in their daily life is training for their spirit.

68
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,110
It is how a samurai builds a strong, iron-willed spirit.

69
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,080
Toshiro Hijikata. Do you have that in you?

70
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,020
Ketchup! That much ketchup on your rice omelet?!

71
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,420
Let me say one thing.

72
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,050
Everyone around me thinks I'm totally crazy for ketchup,

73
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,760
but the truth is, I can't stand tomatoes.

74
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,060
Just looking at one makes me want to puke.

75
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,250
By eating what I detest in excess, I build up an unbendable strong spirit.

76
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,010
Now I've come to love the tomatoes that I once couldn't eat

77
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,270
and even eat my tomatoes with ketchup.

78
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,510
That's not training. That's just plain unhealthy.

79
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,380
Could you do what I did?

80
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,750
Wh-What is that white stuff?!

81
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,120
Mayonnaise!

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,840
M-Mayonnaise...

83
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,150
Mayonnaise on fried rice?! They don't go together!

84
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,760
Could he also be...?

85
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,130
Let me say one thing.

86
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,220
Everyone around me thinks I'm a total mayo maniac,

87
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,790
but the truth is, I can't stand mayonnaise.

88
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,980
Just seeing that red cap makes me want to puke.

89
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,980
[Note: Japanese mayo comes in a plastic squeeze bottle with a red cap.]

90
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,150
He's lying!

91
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,520
He's lying through his teeth because he doesn't want to lose!

92
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,690
That mayo maniac!

93
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,910
Hmph.

94
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,410
I see they don't call you the Demon Vice-Chief for nothing.

95
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,620
That was quite an interesting meal.

96
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,320
I need a smoke. Do you have an ashtray?

97
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,060
Where's your thanks for the meal before you smoke?

98
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,950
Thanks for the god-awful meal.

99
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,780
Here...

100
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,870
Your ashtray!

101
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,710
You have faster reflexes than I expected.

102
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,030
You possess exceptional physical skills...reflexes...

103
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,960
Intuition and courage nurtured by surviving numerous close calls with death.

104
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,680
Fight-tested sword skills indeed.

105
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,090
Most ordinary swordsmen would be no match for you.

106
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,840
But that fighting style only works on third-rate swordsmen.

107
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,280
It won't work in a duel between two masters.

108
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,170
You? A master?

109
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,710
You look like you've never even killed a bug in your life, sonny.

110
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,780
Killing each other is not all there is to swordsmanship.

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,680
Bring it on!

112
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,390
You're...all talk!

113
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,250
I know what you're going to do.

114
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,120
You use a head-on attack that leaves you open for your enemy to attack.

115
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,230
And when he does, you use your quick instincts to parry the blow.

116
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,360
I can read...your moves as well!

117
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,630
Your instincts are too sharp.

118
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,380
Toshi!

119
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,810
You twisted your body to protect the plate from the blow.

120
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,530
Your instincts are truly impressive.

121
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,850
But that will be your demise.

122
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,040
This is bad. That man figured out Toshi's habits in such a short time.

123
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,720
In the real-sword fighting style that we Shinsengumi are proud of,

124
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,850
taking a single blow from an opponent means certain death.

125
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:41,330
That's why the ability to sense danger is an absolute requirement.

126
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,070
The ability to sense your opponent's movements using a highly honed intuition...

127
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,740
to stop the enemy's attack.

128
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,970
Toshi is better at that than anyone.

129
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,100
But this guy's dojo swordsmanship

130
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,630
excels at surprise attacks to score points rather than killing blows.

131
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,070
Versus this guy, Toshi's exceptional instincts work against him.

132
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,670
Carrying that huge plate, he's forced to react quicker than usual.

133
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,940
That guy will attack Toshi's openings.

134
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,920
He'll feign an attack and back off.

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,270
Act like he's backing away,

136
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,030
then strike.

137
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,970
Toshi will unconsciously react... to that guy's countless feints.

138
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,280
That guy will do it over and over again.

139
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,710
He is unmistakably a master.

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,450
His is a dojo sword style that can bend the minds of others to his will.

141
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,890
If this were a dojo match, I'd have already scored multiple times.

142
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,540
And if this were a real fight, you'd have already lost your life.

143
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,320
Give it up already.

144
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,370
You'll be stuck on the defensive with that huge plate.

145
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,290
You still want to continue?

146
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,320
A point, two points...it doesn't matter how many you get-it's all irrelevant!

147
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,090
A fight with real swords means you have to keep fighting even if you lose an arm or a leg.

148
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,830
Just so long as your head is still attached.

149
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,060
This is why I detest the barbaric country samurai fighting style...

150
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,490
By the way, I borrowed an ashtray.

151
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,150
I can't get going without a smoke.

152
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,970
Is that my plate?!

153
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,540
Damn you, when did you...

154
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,710
When?!

155
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,200
Huh? I still have it.

156
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,420
That's...from earlier...

157
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,960
I don't know if you'd call that a feint,

158
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,360
but I won't lose to you when it comes to deception.

159
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,060
For all the ketchup you poured on your rice omelet,

160
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,370
you kept it to a reasonable amount.

161
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,660
You're unable to break away from your set forms.

162
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,840
That's the limitation of dojo swordsmanship.

163
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,310
I put mayonnaise even on dessert.

164
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,730
Come. I'll show you what real fighting is.

165
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,240
Fights, real battles...

166
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,950
In my time, I've seen many like yourself who shout such words

167
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,100
and make light of dojo practice.

168
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,400
They lose the match,

169
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,430
but claim their swordsmanship is more suited to actual battle.

170
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,560
They claim they wouldn't lose if it had been with real swords.

171
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,110
Those are all excuses.

172
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,350
That drivel is what people who don't practice say.

173
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,030
I've heard enough.

174
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,990
No matter how much natural ability you have,

175
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,720
no matter how many times you've been in a real fight,

176
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,370
you cannot win against someone who trains everyday.

177
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,780
That's what I believe.

178
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,330
But, there are some who believe my thinking is old-fashioned.

179
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,570
It's old, all right. And so it that deformity.

180
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,820
Anyone who thinks my deformity is old-fashioned is really the old-fashioned ones.

181
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,070
No, yours is beyond old.

182
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,430
Hey, what's with your eyes?
Why do they look like butts?

183
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,080
You're more rude than old-fashioned.

184
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,670
While you were wildly swinging your swords around screaming about fights and real battles,

185
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,770
we were doing everything we could to train ourselves.

186
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,460
You people cannot win against us.

187
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,060
No, no, you're certainly deadly with words. Now, let's try swords.

188
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,510
Fool! Learn your lesson!

189
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,730
Hmph.

190
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,100
Your attack pattern never changes.

191
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,140
No matter how many times you attack

192
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,480
as long as you carry that huge plate, you'll always have to be on the defensive.

193
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,880
If I show any sign of striking at that plate, you'll always switch to the defensive.

194
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,520
Even if you know I'm feinting, you'll bite. That will leave you open.

195
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,780
Here's the bait. Bite.

196
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,530
You're just a small fry!

197
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
What?

198
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,530
I'm sick of your cheap bait.

199
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,440
If you want to land this fish, bring me a full course meal smothered in mayonnaise.

200
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,860
No more fishing me out!

201
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,420
I won't...retreat anymore!

202
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,880
A high-speed attack to counter the feints.

203
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,600
His plan is to mount a ferocious attack so his enemy has no time to counter-attack.

204
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,890
Offense is the best defense. He's finally acting like himself.

205
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,830
I see you're trying to finish this.

206
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,210
But you can't launch a decisive attack in a place with such poor footing.

207
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,180
Your movement is hampered, so you'll just exhaust yourself.

208
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,370
What's more, you have a fatal weakness.

209
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,630
Don't give me that!

210
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,410
I can read your moves like a book.

211
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,820
Monotonous brute force strikes that never change.

212
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,080
No matter how many times you swing, you won't be able to hit me even once.

213
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,920
You may be able to read my sword...

214
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,570
But you can you read my feet underwater?!

215
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,310
You said I'm stuck in my set forms,

216
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,460
but from what I can see, you're the one stuck in set forms.

217
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,430
Thousands, tens of thousands of patterns and counters have been hammered into my body.

218
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,120
I have learned every possible set form.

219
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,720
It's more reliable than the simple intuition and instinct you rely on.

220
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,220
In a duel, it manifests as a split-second difference in decision-making.

221
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,820
In a duel between masters, that difference becomes fatal!

222
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,760
This is the difference between you and me.

223
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,330
Neglecting to work hard because you were too full of your own natural ability will be your downfall!

224
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,700
This is the strength of the dojo swordsmanship...that you mocked!

225
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,830
Oh no!

226
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,400
That guy is insanely strong! Kondo-san, let's help him!

227
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,380
Kondo-san!

228
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,720
Sorry. Please don't assist him.

229
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,990
What...?

230
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,580
It's hard to hold back when Otae-san is at stake,

231
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,590
but he hates to lose more than anyone.

232
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,830
If you interfere, he'll kill you.

233
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,330
You say he hates to lose, but if this continues, he'll lose anyway!

234
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,740
Maybe so.

235
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,840
But if we assist Toshi, it will mean that I didn't trust him.

236
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,950
He knows better than anyone that street style sword fighting won't defeat that guy.

237
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,810
Right, Toshi?

238
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,290
It happened a long time ago, before we came to Edo,

239
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,140
when I was still training in our dojo out in the country.

240
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,920
There was a young thug who went around making a lot of trouble.

241
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,680
He was a loner with excellent fighting skills.

242
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,580
A delinquent who went looking for fights at all the dojos in the area and beat them up.

243
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,150
The guys at country dojos are all hot-blooded punks.

244
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:04,210
They were losing face and decided to join together to beat the guy up.

245
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,890
They had no Bushido honor of fighting one-on-one.

246
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,280
Anyway, the kid deserved it. So I went to watch.

247
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,190
Turns out the kid had balls.

248
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,870
Even against large numbers, he wasn't a bit intimidated.

249
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,390
Instead of apologizing,

250
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,630
he went on a rampage against the large group, taking down one after another.

251
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,520
Damn was he strong.

252
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,510
But there was no way he could win against such numbers.

253
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,240
In the end, he kept fighting until he was beaten to a pulp.

254
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,880
I debated what to do and then decided to bring him back to my dojo.

255
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,140
He looked like he would've died If I left him there

256
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,590
and he seemed like an interesting fellow.

257
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,390
333! 334!

258
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,190
I can't do any more. That's my limit. My arms are gonna fall off.

259
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,230
Don't give up so easily!

260
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,490
At this rate, I'll never be able to pass on the dojo to you!

261
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,370
I'll probably die soon. What'll you do then?

262
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,370
What's the point of swinging this heavy log?

263
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,270
My hands are covered with blood blisters!

264
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,250
Swordsmanship is not about technique. It's about attitude, fool!

265
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,510
Swinging that log improves your sword skill and strengthens your character!

266
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,780
It grounds you!

267
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,290
Don't swing with your hands.

268
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,810
Discipline your breathing and swing with your entire body!

269
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,890
Look at Sogo.

270
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,940
He's so tiny, but he's swinging that thick log. Isn't he amazing?

271
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,310
You are amazing. I knew you had it in you. You are a prodigy.

272
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,210
Huh? Is this peeling?

273
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,130
This is nothing but tree bark.

274
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,630
Good grief. This is why nobody wants to train here.

275
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,710
Huh?

276
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,520
Give it a try?

277
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,130
Maybe not. Not with those injuries.

278
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,440
From what I can tell, you're blessed with natural talent.

279
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,140
You haven't studied under anyone, but your movements and instinct are extraordinary.

280
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,690
But you can't win on talent alone.

281
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,140
In the end, it's the guy who works hard that wins.

282
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,080
Not interested.

283
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,950
Nobody becomes a great swordsman by playing with lumber.

284
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,980
He's just a punk, after all.

285
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,700
But despite his words, he stayed.

286
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,110
He watched us train like a hungry wolf watching a herd of bacon-wrapped sheep.

287
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,670
But one day, even though his wounds hadn't fully healed, he disappeared from the dojo.

288
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,990
I was worried and went looking for him.

289
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,740
Move, you!

290
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,020
We're on our way to raid the Kondo dojo!

291
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,240
We heard they were sheltering you!

292
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,400
Why'd they do that?!

293
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,100
That's why I left. They're not involved anymore. Leave them alone.

294
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,860
You may have nothing to do with them, but we still do!

295
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,760
Before we beat up the Kondos, we'll kick the crap out of you!

296
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,860
He had become stronger than before.

297
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,790
Despite his injuries,

298
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,840
he possessed a solid framework to his form that hadn't been there before.

299
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,870
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

300
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,970
In the end, he and I were the only ones left standing.

301
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,570
Surrounded by our defeated enemies.

302
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,210
Why're you here?

303
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,320
You can't use our sword style to act like a ruffian.

304
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:03,770
When did I ever join your school? And besides, you did a lot of fighting yourself.

305
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,770
For crying out loud, What are you, some sort of good Samaritan?

306
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,060
I was trying to return your favor, but now I owe you again.

307
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,070
You don't owe me anything.

308
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,030
Come back and visit us anytime. You're already one of our students.

309
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,260
Like I said before-when did I ever join your school?

310
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,680
Those hands...

311
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,600
Are the proof.

312
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,120
How many times did you swing it? Even I didn't get that many blisters.

313
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,660
No wonder your injuries were slow to heal.

314
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,710
These aren't blisters.

315
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,330
[Note: Parody of Mitsukoshi Department Store.]

316
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,330
My hand got caught in the automatic door of the Yotsukoshi Department Store.

317
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,830
That's who Toshiro Hijikata is.

318
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,030
He never expresses his feelings to anyone.

319
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,220
And he never shows it on his face.

320
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,710
But I know...

321
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,670
Back then, and now...

322
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,970
The only thing he cares about is sword fighting.

323
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,180
He's hiding his sword underwater so I can't read where it's coming from.

324
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,580
Nice try!

325
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,350
Do you think that'll work on me now?!

326
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,810
No one trains harder than him.

327
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,050
Certainly,

328
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,380
compared to the showy sword style of the Yagyu,

329
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,820
it might be a rough and unpolished country style, but...

330
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,790
his sharply honed sword skills...

331
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,230
can slice through steel!

332
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,930
Hijikata-san!

333
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,380
Sorry for the wait.

334
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,180
Toshi, you got beaten by him pretty badly this time.

335
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,500
Huh? These aren't from that guy.

336
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,150
[Note: Parody of OIOI Department Store.]

337
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,150
I got caught in the automatic door of the Marui Department Store.

338
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,060
So Nishino and Kitaoji are both out?

339
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,760
I wasn't expecting the enemy to do this well.

340
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,830
I miscalculated a bit.

341
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,800
I thought with Kitaoji there, the three of you would be enough...

342
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,280
Now there are five of them, and we're already down to three...

343
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,040
Tojo-san, we have four. I'm still in.

344
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,380
One of the Four Aces: Sui Minamito.

345
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,680
I got caught off guard and they roughed me up a bit,

346
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,030
but the plate is still intact.

347
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,350
Please give me another chance to make up for it.

348
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,260
Oh, that's right. Then...

349
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,150
Now there are three.

350
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,100
Having someone like you around would only disgrace the name of the dojo.

351
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,430
I, Ayumu Tojo, head of the Four Yagyu Aces will not forgive anyone

352
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,580
who tarnishes our Young Lord's name.

353
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,180
The next episode ... "Four Heads are Better than One."

354
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,520
[Tojo ruthlessly eliminated Minamito. Kyubei finally joins the battle!]

355
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,020
[Meanwhile, Gintoki and Kondo are engaged in an epic struggle.]
