Please turn the lights on in your room and don't get too close to the TV when watching the show.

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,840
[Even though it's already over, please pretend it's Christmas while watching this episode.]

["People Who Say that Santa Doesn't Really Exist Actually Want to Believe in Him"]

6
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,710
Why do I have to come all the way over here on such a cold night?

7
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,390
And it's so frustrating having to visit so many stores just to find Nikuman.

8
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,260
[Note: Nikuman = steamed meat bun. And anman = bean-paste bun.]

9
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,260
I should've bought some Anman for myself. I don't even like Nikum...

10
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,340
Man, they're all messed up.

11
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,240
Man, it's all messed up.

12
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,710
How could you do this to me?! This is all your fault!

13
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,990
You wrecked my sleigh!

14
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,340
Now I can't do anything this year! And it's all thanks to you!

15
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,960
It's your own fault, you old fart!

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,420
We agreed that you'd get off the sleigh whenever we went downhill!

17
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,600
I wasn't pulling the sleigh; I was being chased by it!

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,920
It bashed up my Achilles heels! I'm all bloody!

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,590
Then why didn't you run faster?! Are you a reindeer or a turtle?!

20
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,030
Your dad was awesome!

21
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,330
He led the sleigh like a pro, even when we were on hills.

22
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,970
He was a real reindeer!

23
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,200
You sound like you liked my dad,

24
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,980
but when he was at home he only said bad things about you! It's the truth, you know!

25
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,160
You liar. Carl and I were like brothers! Why, I rarely even had to use the whip on him.

26
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,570
Seriously, he hated your guts.

27
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,080
His last words were, "His beard is actually brown"!!

28
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,420
Bastard! Not so loud!

29
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,590
I'll get in trouble if anyone finds out I dye my beard white for Christmas!

30
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,140
You're the one broadcasting it!

31
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,600
Hey, hey! Settle down. What are you guys doing?

32
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,950
Shut up!

33
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,490
Ow! What the hell are you doing?!

34
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,230
Cut it out, you two. It's the middle of the night.

35
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,610
People are trying to sleep.

36
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,660
I don't know what happened, but...

37
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,160
Well, you beat us up...

38
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,770
Come on, let's have a drink.

39
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,190
By the way, who are you?

40
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,770
Sake helps facilitate communication between people. It's kind of like a social lubricant.

41
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,950
I think Tokugawa Ieyasu said something like that, but I could be wrong.

42
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,410
[Note: Oden = ingredients in soup]

43
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey buddy, heat up three bottles of sake and some oden.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,410
Give whiskers here the check.

45
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,370
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,880
Me, have whiskers?! What am I, a cat?!

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,970
Here you go.

48
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,870
I ought to shave them off.

49
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,450
So tell me why you two were arguing. Who are you guys anyway?

50
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,520
Are you deliverymen or something?

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Well... It's obvious who we are.

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,270
Well, it's against the rules for me to say too much,

53
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,970
but we drive a sleigh and make children's dreams come true.

54
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,230
Like a benevolent thief?

55
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,730
Yeah, yeah sort of... And my name starts with "Sa."

56
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,420
"Sa"? Satan?

57
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,860
Close! But it has a far better meaning!

58
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,430
I know it's none of my business, but I think I have the answer.

59
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,790
You know what I mean... The hint is hanging between his legs.

60
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,610
What?! What kind of hint is that? What kind of answer is that?

61
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,380
[Sankon, a former diplomat of the Republic of Guinea appeared on many comedy TV shows in Japan. In this case, just a pun of "San"]

62
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,680
It doesn't matter if it's Sankon or Santa.

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,380
That's it! One of those was the right answer.

64
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,080
So, you're an old man who rides a sleigh at midnight and does something to children, right?

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,120
Right... but not quite the way you described it...

66
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,970
I see. I know it's none of my business, but I think I have the answer.

67
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,480
They ride around in a sleigh and expose their private parts to people.

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,630
That's not what I said! You may look like a gentleman, but you have a filthy mind!!

69
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,560
Presents! Presents!

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,450
I ride in a sleigh and deliver presents to good children. That's my job.

71
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,750
But my sleigh was wrecked, so...

72
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,750
Can't you do your job without a sleigh?

73
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,620
Absolutely not! The sleigh, the reindeer and the red outfit are my trademarks!

74
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,760
It would shatter people's perception of me if I didn't have them! I'm an icon!

75
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,430
Reindeer? He looks like a monster.

76
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,820
I don't know, but it seems like you're in a fix. Do you need help?

77
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,620
Here's my card.

78
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,420
I do anything for my clients. We're "Odd Jobs."

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,630
I'll help you out, for a price.

80
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,880
What?! What can you do?

81
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,020
Can you get us a sleigh right now?

82
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,580
No problem.

83
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,820
Hop in.

84
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,060
We can't get on that! Its previous occupant is still in it!

85
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,210
Huh? You can see him? He's just "Cardboard" O-san.

86
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,810
He's an elf that only the pure of heart can see.

87
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,730
He can see you, too! He's glaring right at you!

88
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,070
We said we needed a sleigh! This is a two-wheeled cart.

89
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,980
It's not a two-wheeled cart. It's my home!

90
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,310
Oh, sorry.

91
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,700
Don't worry about the little details.

92
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,730
Sleigh, two-wheeled cart-same thing. They even sound almost the same.

93
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,130
It's not a two-wheeled cart. It's my home sweet home!

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,820
Sorry...

95
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,840
What's your mission? To make children's dreams come true, right?

96
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,030
Take the back-to-basics approach.

97
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,170
You guys remember how to be idealistic, right?

98
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,930
What do you know about me?!

99
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,760
If you're worried about the image of Santa, I think your gut is the problem.

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,230
Anyone who sees it will think, "He's as pot-bellied as my dad," and be disappointed.

101
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,560
It's supposed to be like that. I'm an inspiration to all plus-sized people.

102
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,830
Red is unflattering on you, too. It makes you look bigger than you actually are.

103
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,990
Ditch the outfit. It's ugly. You'd look better wearing something more chic.

104
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,930
No... I said this is one of my three trademarks! No!

105
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,130
Hey, if I take off my outfit, I'll just be an old man.

106
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,870
This just...

107
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,730
...isn't right.

108
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,690
No, you look good and chic.

109
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,010
Just as I thought, black makes you look slim and tranquil.

110
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:09,110
But it also makes me kind of uneasy, like I should go lock up the house real tight for some reason...

111
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,740
That's because we look like thieves!!

112
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,150
Nah, more like one of those trendy hipster dads.

113
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,880
These days, throwing a leather jacket on an old geezer makes him look sexy,

114
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,500
even if he's about to croak.

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,790
There's nothing hip about this! I look like a grave robber!!

116
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,980
And you're wearing my outfit! Hey, give it back, right now! Please!

117
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,920
I want to look cool in red this winter!

118
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,630
You already look cool! You'd look even cooler without my outfit on.

119
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,920
Let's start here. This is a poor residential area, so we should help these people.

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,200
Oh, no! If we get caught, it's all over. We'll be reported.

121
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,180
We haven't done anything bad, so why is my heart beating so fast?

122
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,380
So, who should we start with?

123
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,190
I'm not visiting any spoiled kids who asked for something like a Nintendo DS or PlayStation.

124
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,580
[Note: Kendama is a wooden toy with a ball on a string. You try to get the ball to land on a spike on the handle.]

125
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,700
Let's start with the appreciative kids who only ask for a kendama.

126
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,580
Do you really think you're qualified to make children's dreams come true?

127
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,280
Kids today don't want simple stuff like that.

128
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,250
Ah...

129
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,800
I found someone! Yuri Tsukishima-chan.

130
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,460
It's hard to find a kid like her these days...

131
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,330
[A kendama and a sweet mother.]

132
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,460
A-A mother...is kinda difficult...

133
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,910
Yuri-chan... I wonder if her mom died...

134
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,020
Ben, don't say that! It's against the rules to make two wishes.

135
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,930
She won't get anything that way!

136
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,500
How about the others? Does anybody wish they had something like a kendama?

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,340
Why are you insisting on a kendama?

138
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,050
Well, I brought lots of kendama toys because I thought it would be all the rage.

139
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,470
But I was wrong. I was right about last year's Korean star boom in Japan though.

140
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,960
What kind of presents did you give to children during the Korean star boom?!

141
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,800
Hey, there might be a kendama boom after all.

142
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,600
[A kendama and wings to fly into the future.]

143
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,600
I want that, too.

144
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
Who's next? Who wants a kendama?

145
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
Forget about the kendama!

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,770
Shut up. Hey, I don't have anything else, but kendama this year!

147
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,030
So we have to find children who want a kendama!

148
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,300
You're just an old man who hands out kendama as presents! All right, let's see...

149
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,520
Here we go!

150
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,620
[We played kendama all summer together... I'll never forget that summer.]

151
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,100
He's talking about a toy here, right?

152
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,620
How old is this little sicko?

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,050
What are you saying?! I'm all loose and everything.

309
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,140
You're just squeezing it too hard!

310
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,730
Hey! Take your hands off it! Gee! You're gonna kill the old lady!

311
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,420
Take your hands off it! Why don't you tell her to let go?!

[Viper Transportation]

313
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,510
I see... The rest of Viper's gang...

314
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,930
And... What's their plan?

315
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,310
Rumor is they're going to attack the terminal.

316
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,800
Let's see... I heard they'll attack the terminal with a truck full of justa-something bombs.

317
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,980
I can't believe they're going to do it on New Year's Eve.

318
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,840
What do you think? Will it work?

319
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,790
Not a chance.

320
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,000
Why is that?

321
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,410
Any Edoite who tries to get anything done tonight...is bound to screw it up somehow.

322
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,000
Edo's a party town.

323
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,650
Hey, wait! That JUMP is mine!

324
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,250
No!

325
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,470
That is my JUMP!

326
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,670
Is he a monster?!

327
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,930
He's so agile!

328
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,220
Sorry, brother!

329
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,010
I may not look it, but I used to be a member of the Oniwabanshu.

330
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,790
[NOTE: The Oniwabanshu was a group of elite ninjas formed by Yoshimune Tokugawa.]

331
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,790
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

332
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,420
You're trying to get me killed, aren't you?!

333
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,780
I thought I was going to die. I was almost crying, bastard!

334
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm the one who nearly died! Hell, my life is still flashing before my eyes!

335
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,470
It's flashing because we're on a truck!

336
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,900
All right... I'll take...

337
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,350
I won't let you have it!

338
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,930
You don't even understand JUMP's three key principles: "Friendship," "Struggle" and "Victory."

339
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,620
You don't deserve to read it!

340
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,020
It's mine!

341
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,180
I won't let you have it!

342
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,860
"Friendship, Struggle and Victory?"

343
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,090
You think you can master those just by reading JUMP?

344
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,640
Pathetic! You're just trying to fill the emptiness in your life by reading JUMP.

345
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,470
You use JUMP as a confidence booster.

346
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,210
JUMP shouldn't be used for that purpose!

347
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,020
Fine... This is the best way for real men.

348
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,660
We'll settle this just as they do in JUMP!

349
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,600
Tsk. I prefer love-comedy manga to battle manga.

350
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,930
But I have no choice. Sometimes a man must fight for his love!

Now!

354
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,170
...What? Did I just hear a weird noise?

355
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,480
I wonder if the cops know we're here...

356
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,910
Don't worry, it's New Year's Eve and even cops are partying tonight.

357
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,920
Besides, this truck looks perfectly ordinary,

358
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,730
so people will never guess it's equipped with a fearsome bomb.

359
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,680
Edo will soon be a sea of fire.

360

00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,940

"Friendship, Struggle...

366
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,910
...Victory"...

367
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,470
I don't exactly get it, but...

368
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,940
Those aren't bad...

369
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,700
I'll never think of it that way!

370
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,760
This JUMP is mine!

371
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,420
Big sister, what kind of noise do you hear?

372
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,280
Is that a student preparing for his entrance exams by banging his head against the wall?

373
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,970
No, Kagura-chan.

374
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,110
That's the sound of businessmen who've been downsized throwing themselves out windows.

375
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,080
Sis... What are you teaching her, anyway?

376
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,950
It's all right. When you give a child something to dream for, sometimes you have to lie.

377
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,720
Well, your idea of revenge doesn't leave much room for hope and dreams.

378
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,770
Kagura-chan, that's the New Year's Eve bell.

379
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,530
They ring that bell 108 times on New Year's Eve.

380
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,730
108 times? No wonder they're jumping out windows!

381
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,550
108 symbolizes the number of a person's earthly desires.

382
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,880
Each time the bell is struck,

383
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:10,740
another desire is struck from your heart, so you can start the new year fresh.

384
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,140
Kagura-chan, your heart is already clean, so you don't need it.

385
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:20,210
But as people grow up, they become more greedy for things.

386
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,770
Kagura-chan, Shin-chan. I hope you two don't grow up like that.

387
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,070
Desire leads only to ruin.
