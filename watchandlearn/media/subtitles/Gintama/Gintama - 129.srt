Please turn on the lights and keep your distance from the television when watching Gintama. You got thaaaat?!

The Universe, vast and limitless, is filled with many life forms.

As one star dies, another gives birth.

The breath of the vast Universe is passed on from one life to another.

00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,190
A never-ending cycle.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,780
The mysteries of the vast Universe can never be completely revealed.

8
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:53,060
At times, it can even bring upon horrific dangers that defy the human imagination.

Hmm... He's not eating again.

11
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,620
Gin, Sadaharu doesn't have an appetite lately.

12
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,690
He's hardly eaten anything for two days.

13
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,580
He might not be feeling well.

14
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,810
Maybe he's just on a diet.

15
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,320
Males his age do silly things like that just so they can get girls.

16
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,270
Sadaharu's not like that. He's the stoic type.

17
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,930
The last time you said that, he was aroused over some female dog, remember?

[Odd Jobs Gin]

19
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,240
But he usually eats a lot. I'm worried.

20
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,620
Maybe we should take him to the hospital.

21
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,780
Leave him alone.

22
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,270
He's tough. Sprinkle some salt for him to lick and he'll recover.

24
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,650
It seems there's a shadow in his stomach.

25
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,330
Shadow? Is it something terrible?

26
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,860
Who's behind this?

27
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,770
Is it a shadow ninja, of the Tokugawa...or the Yagyu?

28
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,180
No, not Tokugawa shadows. There's something in his stomach.

29
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,590
Does he have an illness?!

30
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,920
Is Sadaharu sick?!

31
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,990
Will he recover?!

32
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,310
He will recover, won't he?!

33
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,180
Calm down.

34
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,760
He's not sick. There's a foreign object in his stomach.

35
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Foreign object?

36
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,190
Yes. Did you make Sadaharu eat anything odd?

37
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,390
Huh? We haven't fed him anything except basic dog food.

38
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,990
I see.

39
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,130
Then he probably ate something off the ground when you took him for a walk.

40
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,880
Dogs put unbelievable things in their mouths when their owners aren't looking.

41
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,400
Especially since Sadaharu is a large breed, anything can go in.

42
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,790
You need to be careful.

So, this is the shadow.

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,970
What could this be? I can't really tell.

45
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,470
Anyway, I'll get him to vomit it out. That'll make him better in no time.

46
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,370
No! Never mind!

47
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,410
Huh? Why?

48

No, it's because, you know!

49
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,110
If all we have to do it make him vomit, we can do it ourselves.

We're...going home.

51
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,060
No, if it gets stuck in his throat as he vomits it out, it could be trouble.

52
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,230
And depending on the situation, he might require surgery.

No, really, it's all right. Just let us go. Don't call the police.

For now, there doesn't seem to be anything else.

65
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,700
But to be safe, they say he should stay overnight at the hospital.

66
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,860
I see.

67
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,460
I'm worried, so is it okay if I stay with Sadaharu overnight?

68
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,370
Oh, okay.

Huh? Zura?

Not Zura. Katsura.

What're you doing here?

00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,410
Don't tell me Sir Sadaharu is not well?

75
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,180
Not as sick as your mind. Don't worry.

76
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,930
I see, I'm glad to hear that.

77
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,720
Zura, what brings you here?

78
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,520
Did you come to an animal hospital because regular hospitals won't touch you?

79

No, Elizabeth's been lacking energy.

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,640
I came here hoping to have her looked at.

The X-rays showed a disturbing shadow.

82
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,970
No, it's just an old man.

83
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,070
Seems she ate something that looked like an old man off the ground during our walk.

84
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,230
No, you're the one who picked up the old man, I bet.

85
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,200
So that's why she'll be having an operation to remove the old man soon.

86
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,400
Taking out the old man means the whole body.

87
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,110
It's no wonder I thought she was behaving strangely.

88
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,880
When I go near her, she smells of aging body odor.

89
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,200
Hey, don't deny the truth.

90
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,560
What you were keeping as a pet is just an old man.

91
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,560
Well,

92
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,090
it's a good thing neither was life-threatening.

93
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,520
Yours is threatened.

94
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,060
After all, you always want to have your pet smiling at your side.

95
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,120
That's true.

96
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,180
I did everything I could, but he was, after all, an old dog.

97
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,160
I don't think his body can withstand any more treatment.

98
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,570
I see.

99
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,260
Kintaro...looks like I won't be able to take him to my Dad.

100
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,600
Is your Father's condition that bad?

101
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,640
Yes. Seems he's not going to make it, either.

102
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,600
Imagine a pet dog and its owner falling ill at the same time.

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,400
I see. Your father was really fond of Kintaro.

104
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,530
An old man and his old dog.

105
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,410
They both lost many things, until all that was left at the end was their friendship.

106
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,260
Those fools, are they planning to die together as well?

107
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,090
Doctor, I've got to go see my Dad.

108
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,930
Please look after Kintaro.

109
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,700
Please see to it that he passes on peacefully.

110
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,260
Sorry... Kintaro, I won't say good-bye.

111
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,010
Thanks.

112
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,280
I can't fall asleep.

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Zura?

114
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,260
What, are you trying to get in my way by sleeping there?

115
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,770
Huh? No.

116
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,580
I was having a bit of trouble falling asleep.

117
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,220
Here there's a breeze and it seemed like a good place to sleep.

118
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,010
That's true. I'll crash here, too.

119
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:35,320
I'm sure he wanted his master to be at his side when he dies, not us.

120
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,390
Who knows?

121
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,930
I heard it from the doctor.

122
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,860
It's almost a miracle that he's still alive despite being ravaged to such an extent by disease.

123
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,430
This animal is apparently a loyal dog that supported his master who lived alone for all these years.

124
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,020
He nestled up next to a stubborn old man

125
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,170
who wouldn't even have anything to do with his own children after his wife died.

126
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,500
He hung on until he was this ragged.

127
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,640
When the old man collapsed,

128
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,250
it seems he just flopped down as if to say his job had ended.

129
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,060
No, maybe he is trying to follow his master into the afterlife.

130
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,150
If that's the case, then maybe this is what he wanted.  This tiny samurai.

131
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,010
Zura, that's why they send you to the animal hospital.

132
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,820
What?

133
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,650
I've made up my mind.

134
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,420
I'm going to let this dog see the old man, after all.

135
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,250
Wait, Leader. What're you talking about?

136
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,910
You plan to take a dog in this condition with you?

137
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,310
It can't wait.

138
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,990
You're the only ones who'd be happy that he died

139
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,170
all by himself in a place like this and became a noble tale.

140
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,640
Have you forgotten?

141
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,140
We can try to get them together, but the old man is on the brink of death himself.

142
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,630
That's why I'm sure he's hoping to see each other, too.

143
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,700
Hope to see him? He's already lost consciousness.

144
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,790
It's all he can do just to breathe.

145
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,760
He has no strength left.

146
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,720
The doctor said so himself.

147
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,880
Instead of needlessly making him suffer, let him peacefully...

148
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,600
You...you're...

149
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,130
Does it...mean that much to you?

150
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,680
When a dog is ragged, and writhes in agony, desperately trying live a long life,

151
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,470
the reason why he won't leave his master's side is obvious.

152
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,910
It's because he wants to stay at his master's side forever.

153
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,920
It's obviously because he doesn't want to leave.

154
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,350
Then there's just one final thing we can do for this dog.

155
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,920
I see.

156
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,840
Little Mr. Samurai, I have underestimated you.

157
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,330
A true samurai does not die for his beliefs. He lives for his beliefs, doesn't he?

158
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,790
Okay!

159
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,470
Let's head to where the old man is.

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,470
Like hell I will!

161
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,510
After eighteen years of suffering while sealed in by that despicable old man, finally...

162
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,090
Finally, the chains have rotted off!

163
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,850
The time for the resurrection of the King of Terror has come.

We go back in time eighteen years.

168
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,690
From beyond the far reaches of the vast Universe,

169
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,920
a frightful beam bringing disaster is approaching Earth.

170
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,780
Parasite X.

171
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,350
Feared as the "Planet Eater."

172
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,960
X splits into infinite beams, raining down on the planet.

173
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,010
Parasitically attaching to all life forms,

174
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,250
it controls the central nervous system

175
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,440
and manipulates its hosts' genes, evolving incredibly quickly,

176
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,850
to create a powerful invasion force in the blink of an eye.

177
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:21,590
Every planet invaded by X is left with a huge scar, as though torn off by a huge jaw.

178
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,590
This is how they got the name "Planet Eaters."

Earth.  Looks like quite a lovely planet.

180
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:38,150
I tremble with excitement when I think of sinking my fangs into such a juicy planet.

181
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,090
So, which creature should I attach myself to this time?

182
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,810
Looks easy, so this time, I'll go with my eyes closed.

183
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,550
Whatever happens, I'll probably be fine.

Why did I get so carried away like that!

187
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,770
With my eyes closed!

188
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,180
Even my senpai told me the real climb begins just before the summit.

189
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,880
As a result, I was cooped up in a dog house for eighteen years,

190
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,320
spending peaceful days without being able to start on world conquest.

191
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,990
Even then, though, I tried so hard.

192
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,780
Fiddling around with the genes and such, you know?

193
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,220
I tried to evolve, you know?!

194
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,800
But in the end,

195
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,910
all I could do was learn to do the front raise on a bar!

196
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,510
As a final measure, I waited for the old man to die,

197
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,820
but just when I thought I was finally free...

198
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,990
My life reached its limit, as well.

199
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,200
How cruel!

200
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,850
Is there no god or King of Terror in this world?!

201
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,940
All I've ever done is a front raise.

202
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,430
I haven't even learned the glider yet!

203
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,480
Give me back my life!

204
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,920
So what happened is, you attempted to take over the Earth, but failed,

205
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,220
and you were kept as the old man's pet this whole time?

206
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,290
Then the reason you desperately tried to live a long life

207
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,310
wasn't because you wanted to stay by the old man's side and support him, but...

208
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,690
...to conquer the Earth.

209
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,910
I waited vigilantly for the old man to die so I'd be freed from that stupid doghouse.

It's true there's nothing to be gained by helping this dog.

218

But I'm sure the old man wants to see this dog, despite what it is.

They are, so to speak, the Planet Eaters' counterbalancing force-the allies of good.

When Z saves a planet, it leaves covered in the vomit of its host as it is expelled.

318
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,650
Okay, today, we have a letter from someone a bit unusual. I'll read it now.

319
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,390
It's a question from Amachi Hideaki of Tokyo.

320
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,220
This is about something that happened a while back.

321
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,780
When I saw an ending where Kagura was running along the beach in Summer,

322
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,620
I wondered about something, so I wrote this letter.

323
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,850
If I'm not mistaken, Kagura is an Amanto belonging to the Yato Clan,

324
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,960
who are supposed to be vulnerable to sunlight.

325
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,990
Basically, wasn't it a given that she always uses a parasol?

326
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,030
I draw a lot of manga myself, and often forget to draw in the parasol.

327
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,470
But is it all right to do that?

328
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,090
It bothers me so much, I can't get on with my manuscript.

329
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,640
Okay, here's the straight answer.

330
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
Yes, I do remember.

331
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,940
It's the one where the voice actress of Kagura said

332
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,630
"Who is this cute girl who appears in the ending?"

333
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,790
when she first saw it, right?

334
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,720
That certainly was Kagura running energetically under the sun with her skin exposed.

335
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,730
But she's fine.

336
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,630
Huh? Why is she fine, you ask?

337
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,670
Okay.

338
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,590
Actually, that was filmed in studio.

339
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,770
Adults play so dirty, don't they?

340
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,960
They explain everything that's not going their way after the fact.

341
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,080
Well, then, Amachi! Don't worry so much about details.

342
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,100
Have a manuscript by tomorrow.

343
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,680
[Preview]

344
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,760
Hey, Gintoki!

345
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,640
This one's a multi-part episode, so how about we call it the Bark-Meow arc!

346
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,740
But the Fuzzy-Wuzzy arc is hard to disregard, too.

347
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,720
But there's the Fluffy-Wuffy arc... Maybe the Cuddly Balls of Flesh arc, after all.

348
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,100
Don't bother. It'll end next week.

349
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,010
What?!

350
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,530
The next episode:

351
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,620
"Cat Lovers and Dog Lovers Are Mutually Exclusive"

352
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,140
[To reunite with Kintaro (Planet Eater), the Old Man (Stubborn) makes an implacable comeback.]

353
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:30,050
[But the Planet Pukers (Cat) hand of pursuit (Cuddly Balls of Flesh) goes dauntlessly after the Planet Eater (Cuddly Balls of Flesh) to corner him (pinch)!!]
