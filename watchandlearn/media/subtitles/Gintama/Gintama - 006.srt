The land of the samurai.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,550
There was a time, long ago, when our country was called by that name.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,950
With the arrival of the "Amanto" from outer space

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,440
and the Sword Ban twenty years ago, the samurai class fell into decline.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,680
In such hard times, there was one man left with the spirit of the samurai.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:26,800
His name is Gintoki Sakata, a reckless Jack of All Trades with a sweet tooth.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,910
Due to some rather unexpected events, I, Shinpachi Shimura, ended up working here.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,220
The three of us slice up a corrupt Edo.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,720
Wait, is that really the story?

[Suspected for the bombing, the Odd Jobs gang are under police questioning.]

12
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,050
[By the way this man is the "Boss", and he's holding a glass of brandy.]

[Oedo Police Station]

15
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,370
Hey, hey, enough already.

16
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,750
We had nothing to do with it, I'm telling you.

17
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,350
I've told you that a million times.

18
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,680
Some things never change.

19
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,850
It's always the perpetrator who claims he had nothing to do it.

20
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,810
How many times are you going to ask me?

21
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,810
I've explained everything from the very beginning to the very end.

22
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,070
Yeah, yeah. All the guilty ones say that.

23
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,040
"My kid would never do that," or "I don't remember."

24
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,360
You're just as hard to believe as the people who say those things, don't you think?

25
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,710
Come on, confess already.

26
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,000
We're not running a charity here, you know.

27
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,070
Or is it that you guys think you'll get off if you keep holding out on us?

28
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,760
Ain't gonna happen.

29
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,210
I've had enough, you shithead!

30
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,150
We're telling you, we're innocent!

31
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,020
Quit wasting your breath and let us out of here right now!

32
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,140
We have places to go!

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,710
Violent Four-Eyes.

34
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,990
Hey, his personality is changing!

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,390
I risk my life getting rid of that bomb and they rake me over the coals for three days.

36
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,770
Rotten cops!

37
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,070
I think you've kept us long enough.

38
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,980
Thanks to me, at least we're not on their most wanted list anymore.

39
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,440
But why'd they release us after Shinpachi freaked out like that?

40
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,040
Because they know someone normally docile is more difficult to deal with when they crack under the pressure.

41
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,090
They piss me off.

42
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,770
So piss on them.

43
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,930
Okay, I'll puke on 'em.

44
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,340
Stop that! This is TV! Control yourselves!

45
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,530
There'll be no end to the number of times I'll be arrested if I hang around you guys.

46
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,370
I'm going on home!

47
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,650
Don't get lost on the way home, you morons!

48
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,620
Hey, hey, we can't have an anime without a straight man.

49
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,350
I don't have a choice then.

50
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,950
I'll be the straight man this week.

51
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,300
You...watch where you're puking!

52
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,210
Whadda stench!

53
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,210
Whadda stench!

54
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,080
Hey...

55
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,420
Stop him! He's an escaped convict.

56
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,330
Phew!

57
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,630
Yes?

58
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,600
Stand back!

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,730
Don't you care what happens to barf babe here?

60
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,590
You scum!

61
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,530
Just for today, I'm...

62
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,870
Hey you, with the naturally wavy hair.

63
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,720
Can you drive a car?

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,930
Yeah.

65
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,100
Damn it! Do you think you can get away with defying the law?!

66
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,400
He's got me!

67
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,580
I'm scared.

68
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,500
I have no choice but to do as he says.

69
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,740
Come on, come on, outta my way.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,540
After him! Don't let him get away!

71
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,550
Well, that was exhilarating.

72
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,880
But do you really think you can get away with this?

73
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,480
Never mind. Just turn right.

74
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,240
These days, escaping from prison is tougher than winning the lottery.

75
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,940
I have no intention of getting away for good.

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,400
Just for today.  I'll be happy if I can be free for just one day today.

77
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,550
Today, is a special day.

78
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,040
A special day, eh?

79
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,320
If you're captured immediately after breaking out of prison,

80
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,150
it'll be a special day you'll never forget for the rest of your life.

81
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,620
Step on it! I can't get caught now!

82
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,220
As you wish. Boost!

83
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,180
I'm a new teahouse maid, sir.

84
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,730
So cute.

85
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,610
Move, move, move!

86
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,270
Pull over, damn it. You can't get away!

87
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,940
Can't get away, you say?

88
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,110
When you say that, it makes me want to prove you wrong!

89
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,550
The suspect is heading for the Terminal Tower.

90
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,780
Request a block at Moe Moe intersection.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,430
Ten-four.

92
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,780
The road, it's...

93
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,740
We're not done yet.

94
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,000
Here goes...

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
Go!

96
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,810
We did it!

97
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,600
We did it!

98
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,200
Crap! A stroller!

99
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,140
Pa.

100
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,450
My son and I walk a path of darkness and evil.

101
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,100
We are in a hurry, so allow us our leave.

102
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,940
Damned wolf. Doesn't he know cars can't stop so quickly?

103
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,200
There they are!

104
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,990
Damn it!

105
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,400
Hey, Pops.

106
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,910
This way!

107
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,770
Damn. Where'd they go?

108
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,130
Find them! They couldn't have gone far.

109
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,790
Hey, come on, wake up!

110
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,910
It stinks!

111
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,660
Why're you helping me?

112
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,730
I'm not sure.

113
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,620
It doesn't make sense. Now you're all wrapped up in this mess. And yet...

114
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,820
Well, yeah, but part of it is that I hate the police.

115
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,570
Maybe I just want to see you through

116
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,320
your special day.

117
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,820
We're almost there. Let's hurry!

118
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,080
Right!

119
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,040
Everybody...

120
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,640
Thank you all for coming to my pooformance!

121
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,090
Pooformance!

122
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,630
Today, forget about your worldly cares, and just have fun, okay, necromancer!

123
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,930
Necromancer!

124
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,550
Okay, for my first song,

125
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,450
"Your Father is Bleep-Bleep".

126
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,730
Please enjoy!

127
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,720
What the hell...is this?

128
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,940
It's the first live performance by today's up-and-coming pop idol, Tsu Terakado.

129
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,180
You jerk. Is this your idea of life?!

130
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,820
You broke out of from prison for a pop idol?!

131
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,230
You'd ruin your entire life for a moment's pleasure?

132
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,110
That's the kind of the mentality that got you thrown in jail, you fool!

133
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,350
It's precisely because I ruined my entire life for a moment's pleasure

134
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,640
that I realize this an important moment that I can't miss.

135
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,020
So come on, let's have fun! L-O-V-E O-tsu-u!

136
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,670
L-O-V-E!

137
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,490
I can't take any more. We're going home, Kagura.

138
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,530
Aww, I wanna stay for more... son of whore.

139
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,990
Don't let it influence you.

140
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,480
This is like a cult.

141
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,860
The air is rank with human stank.

142
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,780
L-O-V-E O-tsu-u.

143
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Louder!

144
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,510
Okay!

145
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,450
L-O-V-E O-tsu-u.

146
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,800
Hey, pay attention! Shout it out.

147
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,450
Sorry, Chief!

148
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,360
Hey, since when did you become their captain?

149
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,300
I've been a captain of Otsu's fan club from the day I was born.

150
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,310
Gyahh! Why're you here, Gin?

151
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,920
That's what I'd like to know.

152
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,520
You go for this teeny-bopper crap, too?

153
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,310
How am I going to explain this to your sister?

154
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,490
I can do whatever I like!  I'm not a little kid!

155
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,740
You there.

156
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,010
Please don't leave your seat during the performance.

157
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,040
You're spoiling it for the rest of the audience.

158
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,270
Sorry, Ms. Manager. I'll throw him out.

159
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,240
Oh, you're from the fan club? No problem, then.

160
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,160
Today is her first live show, so we have to make sure it's a success.

161
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,510
L-O-V-E O-tsu-u.

162
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,830
L-O-V-E O-tsu-u.

163
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,000
You.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,260
We do-do!

165
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,930
Everyone says it,

166
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,900
but when the time comes, I just can't say it.

167
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,610
Bleep-bleep! Bleep-bleep!

168
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,030
Otsu Terakado's second single.

169
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,440
" Your Father is Bleep-Bleep," in stores soon!

170
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,500
If you don't buy it, I'll rip off your mole.

171
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,540
I see.

172
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,490
So you're Otsu's manager.

173
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,990
The two of you, mother and daughter, made it this far.

174
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,950
Impressive.

175
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,710
Hearing that from you doesn't make me happy.

176
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,440
I'm surprised you have the nerve to show your face after all this time.

177
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,200
Aren't you still supposed to be in jail? Why are you even here?

178
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,070
I've had it with you.

179
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,560
I can see you haven't changed a bit.

180
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,150
You live your life however you please,

181
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,910
but do you ever think about the people who suffer for it? Like your daughter and me?

182
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,370
For no other reason than being your daughter, Otsu's had to endure so much.

183
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,350
Otsu, what's the key selling point of your second single, " Your Father is Bleep-Bleep"?

184
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,490
I'd say it's the hidden meaning behind the "bleep-bleep."

185
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,110
I'd be happy if you could appreciate its more mature implications.

186
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,010
Tomorrow is your first solo concert, right?

187
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,410
How're you feeling about that?

188
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,640
I'll do my very best!

189
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,700
Come to think of it, Otsu, your mother is your manager, isn't she?

190
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,580
Yes.

191
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,150
What does your father have to say about your concert?

192
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,340
My father...

193
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,860
Her father died. Thirteen years ago.

194
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,240
Is that true, Otsu?

195
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,730
It's your fault for making Otsu suffer like that.

196
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,320
Just go away, please. And never come back.

197
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,520
Don't force her to relive painful memories like

198
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,950
the fact that her father is a murderer.

199
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,190
Stick of gum?

200
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,130
Why would I want a kiddy thing like that?

201
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,500
The secret to enjoying life is to hold on to the kid inside you.

202
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,320
Well, busting out of jail just to see your daughter's big moment on stage

203
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,480
is something you can't do unless you're a childish idiot.

204
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,760
That's not how it is, dumbass!

205
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,950
I made a promise to her a long time ago.

206
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,210
I want to be an idol ~ La-la-la-la...

207
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,540
You must be my kid! A voice that awful has gotta be hereditary.

208
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,650
Just you wait.

209
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,930
I'll practice and get better, and then one day I'll be an idol singer.

210
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,910
If you can become a professional singer,

211
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,330
then there's even hope for the crickets.

212
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,600
Shut up, you meanie!

213
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,680
If I say I'll be an idol singer, then I will, I'm telling ya!

214
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
How 'bout that!

215
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,830
Well, listen, if you ever go pro...I'll bring a million roses to your first concert.

216
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,890
You absolutely mean that?

217
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,680
Yeah, I promise.

218
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,240
She's forgotten by now, I'm sure.

219
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,170
That was thirteen years ago.

220
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,070
Even if she still remembered, she wouldn't want to.

221
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,830
Not when she knows her pop's a killer.

222
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,130
No telling how much she's suffered because of me.

223
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,390
She probably doesn't even want to see my face.

224
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,140
I'm going back. Besides, I forgot to buy the roses.

225
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,400
Sorry for all the trouble.

Speak normally.

230

I can't understand a word you're saying.

231
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,460
In the concert hall. You see, there was an Amanto.

232
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,990
And to make things worse,

233
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,490
he was one of those Love-Cannibal-Clan Amanto that captures and feeds on the people he likes when he gets excited.

234

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,080
And that's why I came to report it to you.

237
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,070
Why're you speaking standard Japanese now?

238

Chief! Member number 49 has gone berserk!

239
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,080
He was one of us?

240
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,850
I thought he was some kind of inflatable mascot!

241

Otsu. Become one with me...in my stomach.

245

Hey, old man.

That was all I could find.

269

It's not quite a million, so you'll really need to talk 'em up.

Bastard.

271
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,610
There's no way she'd remember that promise.

272
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,990
But at this point, does it really matter if she remembers or not?

273
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,530
I'll keep my promise for myself.

274
