00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,560
And you call yourself human?!

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,240
Just What the [bleep] is yo' mama?

And you call yourself human?!

Just What the [bleep] is yo' mama?

00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,270
All right! Get ready!

00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,240
Urya oi urya oi urya oi

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,190

That mole of yours, the
coloring is very light

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,890
Ro-man-ce

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,680
Ne, ne, ne, ne, necromancer!

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,100
That mole of yours, upon a closer look

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,860
has a single hair growing out of it

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,130
Ru ru ru ru rurururu!

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,270
I have a mole in the small of my back

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,380
in the shape of the Big Dipper

19

Ro-man-ce

Sei sei sei sei seiken koutai

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:11,470
My mole, compared to
others, is a bit large

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,310
Ji ji ji ji ji!

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,040
Oh-tsu,oi Oh-tsu, oi!

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,180
Right now, the two moles

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:19,180
Your mole, my mole

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,180
Oh-tsu,oi Oh-tsu, oi!

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,080
Are joined together

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Wait a minute- wai, wai,

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,650
Wai, wai, wai, wai, Wait a minute-

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,430
Ah, and you still act like a human?

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,640
Hoo hoo hoo hoo

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,640
Ah, well then, I'll say it clearly.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,280
Hoo hoo hoo hoo

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:46,220
Ah, that's enough already,
before I tear out that mole!

35
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,690
Buchi!

36
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,220
And you call yourself human?

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,640
What the [bleep] is yo' mama?!

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,600
Hey, more power! Where's that [bleep]?!

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,680
And you call yourself human?

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,400
What the [bleep] is yo' mama?!

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,120
And you call yourself human?

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,330
What the [bleep] is yo' mama?!

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,620
No good. You're not in sync. And
what happened to your voices?

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,080
At this rate, we'll never be ready
for Otsu's December concert.

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,800
Are you listening?!

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,620
Maybe you've gotten lazy just because
Otsu's become a national idol?!

47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,270
There's no doubt we're not the
only ones rooting for Otsu.

48
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,640
But we've backed her up long
before she became popular.

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,890
We are the pillars of support
for Tsu Terakado!

50
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,790
Let's put more pride into our routine!

51
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,340
R-Right!

52
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,660
Especially you, sergeant!

53
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,020
You're an officer, yet... Huh?

54
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,430
U-Umm... He's checking
his email over there.

55
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,830
Seems he met a girl.

56
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,170
And they email each other
about everything.

57
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:11,100
What?! He's a sergeant and
he's emailing a friend?!

58
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,180
Get this! Email is the devil's tool!

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,100
My boyfriend jilted me and I'm so lonely.
I could use some consoling.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,150
Work is so hectic, my spirit has run dry.
Let's enjoy some good wine together.

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,890
Is it okay if I call you "Brother"?

62
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,680
Lies, all of it! Bloody lies!

63
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,180
[Note: nixi is a parody of the Japanese
social networking site "mixi".]

64
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,180
It's not like that. They met through
some blog or nixi and...

65
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,810
B-B-Blog?!

66
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,530
Crap like, where and what
you do and eat every day;

67
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,400
you had an argument with so-and-so;
that guy is such a pest;

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,580
I dread tomorrow's test.

69
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,930
You write a comment and
you get a comment back.

70
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,350
Oh, you're friends? You're great chums?

71
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,970
Wrong!

72
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,470
Huh? Well?! nixi?!

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,490
Like it's a great miracle or something?!

74
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,520
You can make any false
claim you want on it!

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,470
Just how naive are you anyway?!

76
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,470
And the girl's probably some ugly hoe whose
picture has been totally retouched.

77
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,470
W-Well...

78
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,810
They first met through an Otsu-chan
forum and she's really cute.

79
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,460
He told her that he was a
sergeant in the Fan Club,

80
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,020
and she was so impressed and she's
the one who started to chat with him.

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,210
Hey! Ever since she released the song,

82
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,470
"Your Sister's On A Dating Website," her popularity
with women has skyrocketed, remember?

83
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,850
Huh?

84
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,840
We meant to bring it up later,

85
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,840
but maybe we can have a
girl's division of Fan Club?

86
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,380
G-Girl's division?

87
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,600
We want Otsu to gain worldwide fame.

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,240
A song princess like Beyonce
loved by everyone,

89
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,550
young and old, male and female!

90
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,850
Our happiness is Otsu's happiness.

91
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,940
Doesn't that mean, her happiness
is our happiness?!

92
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,920
Our happiness is Otsu-chan's?

93
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,810
C-Captain!

94
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,810
Sergeant! Recite Article 23 of the
Tsu Terakado Fan Club Bylaws!

95
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,240
Owwww! It says, "Secret communication
with women is forbidden!

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,310
Anyone breaking this rule will
be deemed a spy." Sir!

97
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,390
Correct! Sergeant, you are an officer.

98
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,470
Yet you broke this rule!

99
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,890
Thus...!

100
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,340
You are sentenced to

101
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,270
the Nose Hook Destroyer Final Dream!

102
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,070

A-And I don't need a cell phone.

Y-Yeah! Who needs this thing!

109
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,890
I wouldn't email a girl!

Besides, my cell phone is broken!

I don't need this!

Right! Quit emailing girls
and acting like wimps!

113
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,700
We're not jealous of anything
like that, right?!

114
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,600
Right!

115
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,600
Who cares about emails! Correspondence!
Quit acting so soft!

116
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,520
Right!

117

If you're men... if you're men...

118

Did it wash up with the waves?

Through the Written Word"]

Huh? Shinpachi is acting funny?

138
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,520
Shinpachi always acts weird, Sis.

139
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,450
I know, but it's more than usual.

140
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,700
Lately, he comes home and goes straight
to his room. And he hardly talks.

141
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,370
And he doesn't sleep 'til morning...and
seems intent on writing something?

142
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,420
Intent on writing?

143
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,520
Yes. There are crumpled
balls of paper on the floor

144
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,770
and I just don't know what he's doing.

145
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,880
What is he writing so late at night?

146
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,660
Anyway, he's at a difficult age.

147
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,640
And I think a man like you
should speak to him, Gin-san.

Can you go see what's up with him?

149

Just leave him alone.

150
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,920
When boys get to a certain age,
family becomes a bother.

151
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,770
That's how they become independent.

Independent? Shinpachi, independent?

153
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,310
He's more helpless than a colt at birth.

154
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,380
She's right. Becoming
independent is fine.

155
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,850
But what is he doing cooped
up in his room?

156
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,140
Is that necessary in becoming
self-reliant?

157
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,150
By independent, I mean... Standing up.

158

00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,440
Writing a letter to a total stranger...

161
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,520
I don't know anything about her.

162
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,160
All I do know is...

163
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you believe in destiny?

164
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,920
Heh...

165
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,890
Yes, I do! I really believe in
it! Yes, that's how I'll start.

166
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,890
Shinpachi.

167
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,890
Yes! Gin-san! You're here?!

168
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,300
Hey, don't worry about
your sister too much.

169
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,970
Huh? What're you saying?

170
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,370
One more thing

171
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,630
make sure you wash your hands.

172
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,680
Get your mind out of the gutter!

173
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,270
What are you thinking? You're totally
mistaken. I'm not like that!

174
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,970
And why're you acting nicer than
usual? It gives me the creeps!

175
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,680
Huh?! You're not?

176
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,370
You're not into this stuff?

177
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,850
Oh man, I was wrong. Absolutely wrong.

178
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,070
Sorry you had to come for
nothing. You can go.

179
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,030
Hey! What's the big idea?

180
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,350
What did you think I was
doing in my room?!

181
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,320
Where'd you find them anyway?!

182
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,870
Hey, you forgot this!

183
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,290
Wanna use it?

184
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,340
For what?!

185
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,370
Sis, what are you boiling?

186
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,970
It's nothing, Kagura.

187
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,360
Writing? Then you've been
writing letters at night?

188
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,930
Man, you're such a kid.

189
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,300
Please don't tell my sister.

190
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,430
If she finds out I'm writing letters to
a girl, it would be uncomfortable.

191
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,930
Uncomfortable? Why? Are you thinking
of doing something bad?

192
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,100
No way! That's exactly the kind
of conclusion I don't want.

193
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,180
I want to know her on
a purely platonic level.

194
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,480
Know her how?

195
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,490
It's friendship! Friendship!

196
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,110
Youth is all about friendship,
perseverance, victory!

197
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,150
I mean, think about it.

198
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,450
It crossed the vast ocean and reached
me! It must be destiny.

199
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,720
But if Sis finds out about it, she'll
say I lack morals and get angry.

200
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,560
That's not true.

201
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,640
Your sister is pretty understanding
about things like that.

202
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,690
No, she's not.

203
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,530
Shin-chan.

204
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,310
Sister?!

205
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,600
I brought some tea and
sweets, so have some.

206
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,080
Here...

207
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,520
Just in case, it's not enough.

208
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,370
This is...stringy konjac root.

209
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,150
Huh?

210
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:39,070
Shin-chan... Shin-chan... No matter what you do,
you'll always be my little brother.

211
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,190
You see? She's very understanding.

212
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,430
What the hell is she thinking?!

213
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,900
Just what did you tell my sister?!

214
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,260
What's this lotion doing with the tea?!

215
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,400
And why does this konjac
root have a hole in it?!

216
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,020
She has it totally wrong!

217
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,350
And she didn't look me
in the eye! Not once!

218
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,560
How're you gonna fix this?!
How can we face each other now?!

219
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,770
Now, now. Calm down.

220
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,540
She gave you lotion.

221
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,390
That means you'll have time in private,
to write. I'd say that's great.

222
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,560
It's not great! I'd rather have
her find out about the letters!

223
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,150
This has such a grown-up taste.

224
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,940
There's lots more if you want seconds.

225
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,760
And? Just what did you write
anyway? Let's see.

226
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,100
Never mind! Stop!

227
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,670
"How do you do? I read your
letter. Isn't it strange?

228
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,100
It crossed a vast ocean and reached me"

229
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,030
Hey, this is it?! It's too
long and so ordinary.

230
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,900
So what?! What's the use of putting
on a pretense? It's a letter.

231
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,670
You want to get to know this girl, right?

232
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,690
You want to get close to her, right?

233
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,010
You have to show off.

234
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,900
Huh? Show off?

235
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,230
Look, she tossed her letter-in-a-bottle
into the ocean

236
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,920
hoping to find a random pen-pal.

237
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,640
How much more showy can you get?

238
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,630
And this brief message.

239
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,820
Unconventional women like
her get bored quickly.

240
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,590
She won't read more than
three sentences.

241
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,950
I guess my letter is too long
and doesn't get to the point.

242
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,230
Since you don't know anything about her,

243
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,530
you need to say something
about yourself.

244
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,920
And you can introduce yourself
in three sentences.

245
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,410
And add a photo, just like she did.

246
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,290
I see, I guess so.

247
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,890
But can I really introduce myself
in only three sentences?

248
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,770
Sure you can. Just keep it simple
and easy to understand.

249
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,140
How's this?

250
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,390
[Shinpachi Shimura]
[I changed my glasses.]

251
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,270
That tankobon?!

252
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,390
This is the back cover of a graphic
novel! I've seen it before!

253
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,890
Why is the writer's most recent photogragh
only of his glasses?!

254
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,140
Because if the writer reveals himself,
it lowers the value of his work.

255
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,480
In the past, JUMP would include photos

256
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,220
of the creators in their New Year's issue.

257
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,610
But somewhere along the
way, it stopped, right?

258
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,370
And that's the reason why.

259
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,880
Don't be so rude!! And not only that,

260
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,630
there's only one sentence, not three.

261
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,120
And the photo and the sentence
only focuses on my glasses.

262
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,070
Well, I thought about what to write,

263
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,790
but there were only your glasses
that were out of the ordinary.

264
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,270
Out of the ordinary?!

265
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,970
You know, you're sort of a flat person
with only those glasses that stand out.

266
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,270
I tried to bring that out somehow,
but this is the limit.

267
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,680
Am I such a sorry human being?!

268
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,900
No, it's actually better since there's
lots of room for imagination.

269
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,060
It conveys something deeper,
something more fashionable.

270
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,770
What's deep about only saying
that I've changed glasses?!

271
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,560
And besides, I haven't
bought new glasses.

272
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,450
All right, then how about this?

273
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:55,170
[I changed. My glasses. You know.
-Shinpachi Shimura]

274
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,840
Much more substance, right? And
there are the three sentences.

275
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,870
You just broke it up!

276
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,190
There's not even a millimeter
more in substance!

277
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,750
All it says is that I bought new glasses.

278
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,600
And let me repeat again, I haven't
bought new glasses!

279
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,140
In order to make it interesting,
a little fabrication is necessary.

280
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,270
On television, that type of thing could get
you kicked out of the TV federation!

281
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,660
Only someone clueless to the
situation would say that.

282
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,220
A little acting is necessary here.

283
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,450
Well, this letter is not interesting at all!

284
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,640
If you're gonna make a production
out of it, add a little polish!

285
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,910
Three sentences!

286
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,350
To make an impact, there's gotta
be at least three sentences.

287
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,720
Three sentences, huh? Well, I'll try.

288
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:37,970
[Thank you for sending me so many glasses.
I will wear them along with the S.]

289
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,370
How's this?

290
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,570
That's like an insert in the Table
of Contents in JUMP!

291
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,320
It's straight from the magazine!

292
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,720
Why's it like a Valentine's greeting?

293
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,260
What's this about "so
many glasses"?!

294
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,410
And this "S"?! What "Staff"?!

295
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,780
That doesn't mean staff. It stands
for S as in Shinpachi.

296
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,490
Shut up! Only Shinpachi wears glasses!
Nothing's been changed!

297
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,930
It's completely off the mark.

298
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,900
If I send this, she wouldn't
think it's a letter to her,

299
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,250
but rather an acknowledgment
that I received glasses.

300
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,610
Let's just start over.
From the very beginning.

301
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,740
Oh, I guess you're right.

302
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,500
From the start, Shinpachi.

303
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,020
Just as you said, go back to the
beginning and think it over.

304
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,490
Think back, Shinpachi.

305
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,040
What is it about this letter
that captured you?

306
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,680
Yes. It's not the unconventional way
it was sent nor the brief message.

307
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,920
Wasn't it this?

308
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,810
N-No! I don't judge people by their looks.

309
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,020
Well then, let me ask you.

310
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,730
If this girl happened to be ugly,
would you think about replying?

311
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,520
Uh...

312
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
So you see?

313
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,980
No matter how hard you wrack your brains
to come up with the perfect lines,

314
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,420
ultimately what counts is...

315
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,520
What you see!

316
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,180
I can't argue with that.

317
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,890
But, if that's so, a loser like
me hasn't got a chance.

318
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,890
Shinpachi, take off your glasses.

319
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,890
It's no use. Even if I take
off my glasses, I...

320
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,440
Shinpachi, a healthy soul manifests
itself on one's exterior too.

321
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,630
Soul?

322
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,250
Take heart. You have a good soul.

323
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,540
Gin-san...

324
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,930
I will! I'll do it!

325
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,100
What do you think of
something like this?!

326
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Hey, that's good. Yes, yes, yes, yes!

327
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,170
A little more to the left.

328
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,970
Okay, smile, Shinpachi-kun.

329
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,600
Photograph me! Shinpachi-kun is right here!

330
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,980
Assault Buster!

331
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,170
You're wrong.

332
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,930
These glasses make up
95% of you, Shinpachi.

333
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,150
In fact, these are more Shinpachi than you.

334
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,460
You're saying I only make up 5%?!

335
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,090
Well, 3% is water, 2% is garbage.

336
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,380
You're labelling me garbage?!
Or maybe, I'm not even 2%?

[Shinpachi Shimura]

More importantly, this is exactly
the same as before!

339
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,430
Except the reasoning is different!

340
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,430
Yeah, but the ones hanging on this
tree are nice. It's got substance.

341
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,010
Put them on me!

342
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,110
But there's just something missing.

343
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,480
Damn right! They're not on me!

344
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,090
Isn't there a better scenario?

345
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,520
Not this. Not this either.

346
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,020
Which one is most like Shinpachi?!

347
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,710
All right! This is it!

348
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,350
Is Kondo-san here?

349
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,060
That's a different person!!

350
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,650
They turned out pretty cool, Shinpachi.

351
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,600
That's not Shinpachi. What?
Should I just die?

352
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,560
Sister! Look! Look! Really!

353
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,690
It really came, a letter for you!

354
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,600
You got a reply to your letter!

355
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,180
This can't be happening. Someone
really picked up the letter.

356
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,850
Let me see! Let me see!!

357
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,660
What does it say, Sister?!

358
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,070
"I received your letter. I'm looking forward
to our correspondence from now on."

359
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,430
"My name is

Then this is where I, Kondo,
the Love Expert, come in!

365
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,260
Shut up, stalker!!

366
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,040
That's not happening.

happens to Shinpachi's correspondence?]

Uh... it seems we still have
another minute left.

373
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,190
Shh! Stay quiet, Shinpachi!

374
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,990
We're on a mission here. A mission.

375
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,650
A mission?

376
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,610
Last week, when they broadcasted the part
with one image and only audio.

377
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,210
I suspect, the big guys up there...

378
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,400
Yelled "You didn't spend any
money on this episode at all!

379
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,420
We'll lower your production budget!!"

380
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,010
True, we were able to finish
the episode on the cheap.

381
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,450
But, think about it.

382
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,220
For those episodes, the staff put in a lot
of effort and created more images.

383
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,700
Costs went over-budget and
need to be paid immediately.

384
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,600
We're actually losing money
creating those episodes.

385
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,900
It's not fair.

386
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,390
Oh well, what can you do.

387
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,410
So! What if we show one
minute of background with

388
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,120
only audio after the actual
episode every week.

389
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,630
Then... hey, presto!

390
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,330
In six months, we'd have one episode
worth of background art with only audio.

391
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,200
Ooh, I see! That's even more pernicious!!

392
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,580
I knew it wouldn't work.

393
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,020
