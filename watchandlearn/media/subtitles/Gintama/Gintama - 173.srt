Oh, Katsura-san?

167

Wh-What's wrong, Elizabeth?

177
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,280
You're not your usual self!

That's right, Katsura-san!

179

That's what we've been trying to tell you!

180
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,880
This isn't the Elizabeth you know!

181
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,720
That's right!

182
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,850
It's a completely different fake!

183
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,700
Wake up already!

184
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,790
I understand...

185
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,420
I'll go wash my face to wake myself up!

186

That's not what we meant!

187
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,560
No, Elizabeth is Elizabeth
and nothing but Elizabeth.

188

He seemed really disturbed...

189
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,720
Did we bring Katsura-san to his senses?

190
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,070
Beats me.

191
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,320

thing isn't Elizabeth by now.

Hey!

You're already running one scam
by pretending to be Elizabeth,

yourself without paying!

327
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,890
It's me, but it's not my fault!

328
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,300
Sadaharu, what are you trying to say?

329
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,520
Hurry over here before you catch
his bed-shitting habits, Sadaharu.

330
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,420
I wasn't talking to you!

331
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,410
Gin-san! I mean, Sadaharu!

332
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,970
Good morning.

333
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,600
Sh-Shinpachi!

334
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,130
You should be able to notice
the problem here!

335
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,020
You've been with me since
the first episode!

336
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,480
I'm sorry about calling
you a lame four-eyes!

337
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,540
Those glasses are the glasses
of truth which reveal all!

338
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,040
What's wrong, Sadaharu?

339
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,430
And something stinks.

340
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,460
What's this smell?

341
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,020
Gin-san, I was already
disappointed in you,

342
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,440
but I wasn't expecting you to get worse.

343
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
You've reached a new low.

344
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,400
You better clean this yourself.

345
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,750
What? He's looking down on me?

346
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,580
Kagura-chan, let's go kill time
at Otose-san's place.

347
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,850
Let's.

348
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,260
We'll catch his bed-shitting
habits if we stay here.

349
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,590
Shitface.

350
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,840
Sadaharu...

351
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,460
Why is Gin-san's status spiraling down?

352
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,170
How can you humiliate me when we've
only switched places for a little...

353
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,830
Switched places...

354
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,600
That's it!

355
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,650
A switch can be resolved by
falling down a set of stairs!

356
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:02,660
That's been the typical method
used to end these stories!

357
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,390
I-It didn't fix anything!

358
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,270
Good timing, Zura!

359
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,980
Stop that guy!

360
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,030
They say that a boy can transform
himself in three days...

361
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,900
Haven't you changed in some way?

362
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,520
Yes! That's right!

363
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,670
I knew you would understand!

364
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,260
Well, we shouldn't stand here and talk
so let's find a place to sit down.

365
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,150
Though it may take a shake
or two to find a spot,

366
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,660
but it's better than standing around
like we're trying to play dead.

367
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,310
What are you doing, Zura?!

368
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,020
How dare you use your conversation
to manipulate me!

369
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,680
In that case, I'll use gestures or pantomime
to tell him what's going on!

370
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,710
Well, Sadaharu-dono...

371
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,250
Creepy!

372
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,480
Stop, Zura!

373
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,650
Such a cutie.

374
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,650
[Note: Masanori Hata (a.k.a Mutsugoro) is a writer and naturalist. He was an owner of "Mutsugoro Kingdom", a ranch with various animals.]

375
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,650
Why the Mutsugoro-san impression?!

376
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,340
Can I fluff your stomach?

377
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,150
Stop!

378
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,930
I don't wanna admit it!
Don't wanna admit it!

379
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,370
But it feels so good!

380
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:11,950
So good!

381
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,570
No! No! Yes!

382
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,940
What a lovely day.

383
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,880
I've been violated...

384
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,980
Wait, Sadaharu?

385
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,370
Damn it! Where'd that bastard go?!

386
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,540
What's with the penetrating look?

387
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,170
You're not your usual self.

388
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,590
I love it!

389
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,160
You're making me numb!

390
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,490
Look down on me as much as you want!

391
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,770
Step on me!

392
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,380
I'm a poor little bitch who
wants your love!

393
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,520
What's with that pose?

394
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,890
Don't tell me you want hardcore
play in the middle of town!

395
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,600
Very well!

396
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,910
I'll accept whatever you have to give!

397
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,010
Bring it on!

398
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,070
Hurry!

399
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,820
Come!

400
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,820
What are you doing?!

401
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,200
Do you have any idea what
time this show airs?!

402
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,950
This anime may use a lot of toilet humor,
but there's a line you don't cross!

403
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,320
You can't show this hardcore
freak show on TV!

404
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,860
I've changed jobs from the main character

405
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,950
[Note: Changing jobs is a parody of Dragon
Quest, the videogame series.]

406
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,950
to a sub-character who might get to
show up once every quarter-year...

407
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,680
Farewell, fans of Gintoki Sakata...

408
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,360
Hello, fans of Sadaharu-kun.

409
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,400
I may have changed on the outside, but
my soul will continue to shine brightly!

410
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,860
For eternity!

411
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,600
Man, I'm, uh, you're taking this in stride...

412
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,800
Gin-san.

413
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,660
Gin-san, you awake?

414
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,720
Shut up, Shinpachi.

415
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,140
Don't talk right next to me.

416
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,600
Your voice is loud.

417
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,490
Huh?

418
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,300
Isn't that Sadaharu?

419
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,310
Huh?

420
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,480
I can't be looking at Sadaharu
if I'm Sadaharu,

421
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,630
so if I'm looking at Sadaharu,
my eyes can't be Sadaharu's,

422
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,880
which might mean I...

423
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,220
returned to normal...

424
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,520
Huh? What's this?

425
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,110
That sucks.

426
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,820
These glasses are getting really loose.

427
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,110
Huh!

428
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,730
Er, what?!

429
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,860
Glasses?!

430
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,440
I turned into his glasses?!

431
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,050
Who's Gin-san then?!

432
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,380
Gin-san, please wake up already!

433
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Noooo!

434
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,670
The next episode...

435
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,020
"People Open Up When
They're Locked Up."

436
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,900
[The Odd Jobs gang are trapped in an elevator, with no help in sight...]

437
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,940
[The second half is "Are There Still People Who Go To The Beach And Yell Out 'Bakayaro'"?]

438
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,230
[See you next time.]
