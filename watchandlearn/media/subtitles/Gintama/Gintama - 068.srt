Man...so lazy...

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,200
It's so hot, it feels like my brain's gonna melt...

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,680
Oh yeah, now that I think about it, weren't we supposed to be somewhere right now?

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,590
Right, like we can walk in this blazing heat!

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,990
My character is from the Yato clan so I have a weakness to sunlight. Well, that's what they say.

Stop talking about the writer's back-story.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,850
You're right. I don't feel like doing anything when it's hot like this.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,270
So what do you say?

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,950
Cancel today's show, too?

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,580
It often happens in JUMP. They take a break because the author is out collecting material for the story.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,600
Okay, in that case, GinTama will be taking a break today.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,590
Please look forward to our next show!

Oh, the sound of festival music...

How nice. Everyone but me gets to enjoy the festival.

23
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,910
I want to eat dried-up fried noodles too.

24
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,180
Stop whining.

We've got no choice.

This event takes place every year in Kabukicho.

27
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,200
We all have to take turns doing this job each year.

28
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,360
It's kind of like our civic duty as residents of Kabukicho.

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,890
But let's not forget Ochi, the ol' man who runs it every year...

30
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,340
...is a real pain in the butt.

31
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,540
Sakata-san, I told you multiple times to be here at noon for the rehearsal.

32
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,780
What are you going to do if there's an accident or someone gets injured because we didn't rehearse first?!

35

If you don't feel like doing it, then go home.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,880
I'll do it all by myself this year!

37
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,520
Sorry about that.

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,480
See ya.

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,190
Good! That's all I wanted to hear from you.

40
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,260
I forgive you, so get back here.

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
Huh?

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,510
Hey? Sakata-san?!

43
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,740
Um... I've got lots of watermelon and other stuff for you!! Sakata-san!!

44
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,530
I'm sorry, Sakata-san! I was out of line. Sakata-san!!

Come on, gimme a break.

47
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,520
At this hour, we don't even have time to do a rehearsal.

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,380
Well, I'm really sorry.

49
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,180
You keep saying you're sorry, but you don't sound apologetic at all.

50
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,690
Sorry!

51
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,380
You know, I've been around a long time,

52
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,900
and that's the most offensive apology I've ever heard.

53
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,440
What are we going to do?

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,270
What if we start the haunted house without a rehearsal and someone gets hurt?

55
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,870
It's my job to make sure this event runs smoothly and safely every year.

56
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,380
We can't let anyone get hurt during this festival's haunted house.

57
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,450
It's hard to take someone with an arrow sticking out of his head seriously.

58
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,080
It's for the role I'm playing.

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,200
It's from a battle.

60
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,730
I'm a battle casualty. That's the setting.

61
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,930
So battle injuries are acceptable?

62
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,520
Yes, battle injuries are acceptable.

63
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,380
But if you think about it, battles were instigated by the rulers of the time for their own purposes...

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,400
so for commoners like us, a battle would feel a lot like an accident.

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,350
Oh my god! What is wrong with you people!

66
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,620
You want me to take this arrow out?

67
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,210
Don't you like my arrows?

68
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,640
Anyway, customers who come to the haunted house are adrenaline junkies.

69
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,420
They're high on the adrenaline rush, so who knows what they'll do?

70
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,190
That's why we have to be ready for any unexpected accident that might occur.

71
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,600
Don't worry about it. Our adrenaline is always running low.

72
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,540
Before you know it, we'll have drained all their excess energy.

73
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,480
I don't want a lethargic haunted house!

74
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
It has to be spine-tingling!

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,700
No problem. We don't need a rehearsal.

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,710
All we have to do is say, "wah" and "kyah" and the scared customers will say "wah" and "kyah" with us.

77
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,700
Just leave it to us.

78
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,210
All right, let's do this!

79
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,320
Hey! We want "wah" and "kyah" to be shrieks of fear, not death cries!

80
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,610
What do you guys think you're here for?

81
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,080
We're trying to test people's courage.

82
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,320
Not rip their hearts out!

83
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,070
You gotta be this extreme to get a reaction out of all the jaded kids these days.

84
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,430
No! Didn't you hear what I said?

85
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,030
I said I don't want any accidents or injuries!

86
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,710
So what's with that getup?

87
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,110
Didn't I ask you to bring ghost costumes?

88
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,650
Not dress like bloodthirsty killers!!

89
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,620
You know what's really scary...?

90
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,070
Let me tell you...

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,990
It's the human heart.

92
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,640
Do I look like I'm interested in your muddled insights?

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,750
I'm a ghost, just like you asked.

94
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,230
My character, Kaguriina is a doll that is possessed by the ghost of a serial killer.

95
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,940
I've never even heard of such a character!

96
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,630
All I see is a hillbilly sushi chef.

97
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,690
As for you, god knows what the hell you're supposed to be.

98
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,210
Huh? You know, the ghost of a yakuza.

99
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,920
What an idiotic idea!

100
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,240
Combining two scary things doesn't equal greater scariness!

101
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,990
Only a total idiot would think of that!

102
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,570
Go change your costumes! Change them!!

103
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,790
We still have the ones left over from last year, so put those on for now.

104
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,670
Sorry about that, Ochi-san.

105
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,550
Okay, forget the yakuza ghost. I'll be the ghost of a security guard.

106
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,010
That'll work, right?

107
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,360
Like hell it would!

108
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,000
What? Why are you looking at me like you solved the problem?!

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, at least it's better than before.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,130
So there's a vampire at the temple now?

111
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,600
Yeah, where's the logic in that?

112
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,290
We don't really mesh here.

113
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,560
Let's at least have a coherent view of the world, you no-good geezer.

114
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,530
This isn't going to work, uh-huh.

115
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,680
Did the costumes you were wearing before mesh?

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,030
Where was the logic in that?

117
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,120
Gimme a break.

118
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,390
In what universe is there a house that's haunted by Jason and a dead samurai?!

119
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,070
Ochi-san. It wasn't Jason. I was Jackson.

120
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,520
He's an original character I created.

121
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,870
Who the hell cares?!

122
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,960
I don't give a damn about your wretched creations!

123
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,060
Ochi-san!

124
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,210
We've got customers!!

125
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,970
A party of two is on its way up.

126
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,710
Already? But it's not even dark yet.

127
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,610
Oh, whatever.

128
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,720
We'll just have to wing it!

129
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,780
You guys head over to the temple gardens.

130
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,900
That's where we'll set up the haunted house.

131
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,150
You won't need those!!

132
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,690
Do you guys really want to be a part of this or not?

133
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,410
Daddy, I'm scared.

134
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,990
Don't worry. Daddy's right here with you.

135
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,850
But it feels like something could jump out at any moment.

136
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,600
Hey you, stop making so much noise with those dishes.

137
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,690
I told you to leave them behind, didn't I?

138
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,820
Yeah, but look how many there are.

139
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,720
What is this? What are they used for?

140
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,740
[Note: A famous Japanese ghost story about a maid who is falsely accused of breaking a ceramic plate and subsequently dropped in a well.]

141
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,740
It's just like in that Bancho Sarayashiki story, Kagura-chan.

142
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,960
She counts all the dishes one by one and after the ninth one she says,

143
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:22,970
[Note: Her ghost comes out of the well every night counting dishes but is always short one dish.]

144
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,970
"There's one missing. I curse you!" and then pounces on you.

145
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,160
One...two...

146
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,560
Huh? You're right. There is one missing.

147
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,960
Hm? Huh?

148
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,220
Hey, it's right over there.

149
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,360
Ah!

150
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,890
I'll go get it.

151
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,290
Just chill!

152
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,590
Or you'll spoil our hiding place.

153
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,210
I've already heard everything...

154
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,660
But if we're short one dish to start out with and we're missing one,

155
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,240
then that means we're actually short two.

156
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,980
Kagura-chan, don't worry about it.

157
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,380
Just say, "There's two missing. I curse you."

158
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,840
No, I don't want to. That's not how the story goes.

159
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,720
No, don't! Kagura-chan!

160
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,860
Th...The dishes...

161
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,810
That was nice of you.

162
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,470
Well, I felt sorry for her.

163
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Mmm... I got candy!

164
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,940
What do you mean, "I got candy"?

165
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,240
Why is a vengeful ghost receiving pity from people?!

166
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,820
Come on! Pull yourselves together!

167
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,810
That was pathetic!

168
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,660
It was lamer than my karaoke performance at my friend's wedding.

169
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,090
Yeah, but it's hard to move around with all these dishes clattering about.

170
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,020
Can't we change them to Frisbees or something?

171
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,650
So you're gonna count one Frisbee, two...

172
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,330
What the hell kind of vengeful grudge are you gonna have?

173
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,230
If you break any more dishes, you'll exhaust the community budget!

174
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,280
I have no choice!

175
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,060
I'll show you how it's done.

176
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,490
Now, watch carefully.

177
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,900
Gotcha.

178
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,620
While you do that, we'll go kill time at a coffee shop or something.

179
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,100
Are you even listening?

180
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,110
And, no! Don't leave!

181
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,310
Huh? Why are you putting so much effort into this?

182
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,470
Please don't leave!

183
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,630
Well...

184
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,570
He's doing it for money.

185
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,720
Or maybe a woman.

186
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,730
So, Ochi-san!

187
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,800
What do you want us to do?

188
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,470
O...Oh, yeah.

189
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,110
I haven't been participating in this year after year for nothing, you know.

190
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,480
Like last year... I can't even remember how many girls I made cry in fear.

191
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,890
Ochi-san, the next customer is here.

192
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,530
Please stand by.

193
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,820
So they've come... Our next victims...

194
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,360
You guys go hide over there.

195
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,950
Now watch me carefully and try to mimic my technique.

196
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,360
Okay then, I'm off.

197
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
Welcome.

198
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Oh...

199
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,260
Two, please.

200
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,730
Ochi-san...

201
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,910
You're in trouble now.

202
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,790
I told you, I hate these things.

203
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,610
Oh come on, what's the harm of getting scared once in a while?

204
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,380
Hey! Don't cling to me so tightly, Otae.

205
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,960
It's difficult to walk.

206
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,390
Seriously, I'm really bad with stuff like this.

207
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,120
Oryo, don't leave me.

208
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,370
There you go again.

209
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,090
You're not scared of anything...

210
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,540
I'm telling you, I can't take it!

211
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,760
I'm serious. Dead serious.

212
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm scared. I'm too scared!

213
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,490
You're way scarier...

214
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,830
Don't leave my side, okay?

215
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,030
Don't leave my side, okay?

216
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,540
That was easy.

217
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,680
Stop it. Seriously, stop it.

218
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,710
Seriously...

219
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,680
I said I'm bad at this!!

220
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,120
No, I've had enough!

221
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,830
Let's go home, okay? Let's go!

222
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,660
Hold on a second.

223
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,720
Just calm down, Otae!

224
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,210
What's up with that girl?

225
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,260
What's going on?

226
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,950
Damn, in that case... Phase Two.

227
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,850
HinTama!

228
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,580
[Note: HinTama is slang for Hitodama, the "spirits of the dead that are in the form of firefoxes". It is also a play on GinTama.]

229
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,580
Hintama! They're Hintama!!

230
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,080
Hey, stop! You're killing her!

231
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,070
She'll die!

232
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,200
What're you doing?

233
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,080
Come on! Even freaking out has its limits...

234
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,680
Gross!

235
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,890
Good job.

236
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,110
You really look like a fallen samurai now.

237
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,880
You've fallen too far though...

238
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,490
You're almost half-buried into the ground.

239
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,310
Yeah, like a bungee jumping accident.

240
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,970
Your fall was as dangerous as bungee jumping naked.

241
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,140
I've had it! This is the worst year ever!

242
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,010
I can't take it!

243
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,480
Both the staff and customers are just totally unreasonable!

244
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,210
Hey, come on. That's no way to talk during O-bon Festival.

245
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,210
[Note: O-bon is a Buddhist tradition of honoring the spirits of the dead.]

246
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,340
The year isn't over yet.

247
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,830
You can say that on New Year's Eve after you've done everything you can do.

248
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,110
Sure, that's easy for you to say.

249
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,980
I bet everyone's heard how lame this is.

250
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,260
No one's gonna come now.

251
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,760
It's over. They'll kick me out of the neighborhood association now!

252
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,900
And after all my struggles to reach a position where I could lord it over everyone!

253
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,320
The neighborhood association was the only place left for me.

254
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,630
Isn't this haunted house just a sideshow in the festival anyway?

255
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,430
You sound pitiful, just like the piece of fat that's been forgotten in the corner of the sukiyaki pot.

256
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,560
No, the sukiyaki fat is better off than me.

257
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,010
I get no respect at home or even at work.

258
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm scorned at the office as dead wood.

259
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,440
My desk is by the window.

260
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,440
[Note: In Japan, often useless, unneeded employees are seated by the window.]

261
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,710
[Note: Ochimusha means defeated samurai.]

262
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,630
I was nicknamed "Ochimusha."

263
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,710
Every day, my boss scolded me...

264
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,960
...and my subordinates laughed at me.

265
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,090
I was laid off.

266
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,070
And my wife...

267
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,870
She left me...

268
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,400
But even someone like me was able to find a place where I can shine.

269
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,840
And that was here.

270
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,110
People got scared and ran away when they saw me.

271
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,210
It made me feel big and important.

272
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,780
I even devised my own clever schemes to scare the customers.

273
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,780
That's why...I have to make this haunted house a success, no matter what!

274
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,780
I don't expect you to understand how I feel...

275
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,220
Besides, I didn't really want to tell you since it's so embarrassing...

276
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,170
Ochi-san...

277
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,950
Embarrassing? Who cares?

278
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,510
This is the place you decided to live, right?

279
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,140
What's being embarrassed going to do?

280
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,050
If you're really serious about accomplishing something,

281
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,330
then stop grumbling and throw your heart and soul into it.

282
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,000
If you give it your all, then everyone will be able to feel it.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,600
Whether it be this haunted house or anything else...

284
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,830
Leave the setup to us.

285
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,180
We'll reel them in and set 'em up for you to close in for the kill.

286
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,500
Sakata-san...

287
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,140
I'll make this event a success if it kills me!

288
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,990
Let's do this!

289
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,070
Gin-san...

290
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,040
If I didn't say that to him, there's no telling how far he would have fallen.

291
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,970
Well, his name, "Ochi" does mean, "to fall."

292
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,770
Excuse me. I'm by myself, but may I go in?

293
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,540
Oh gosh, I'm so nervous.

294
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,970
I'm such a scaredy-cat, but I can't resist stuff like this.

295
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,510
Pretty silly of me, huh?

296
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,570
Oh no, no, no. Not at all!

297
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,220
Oh? Why are you crying?

298
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,710
Yeow... One customer on his way!

299
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,630
Crap... Ochi-san's in trouble...

300
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,460
He's about to live up to his name.

301
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,530
You just wait and see...

302
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,790
I'll make this next one perfect.

303
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,360
I'll show you what I'm made of!

304
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,070
Oh, here he comes.

305
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,220
What the hell is that?

306
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,340
What's a monster doing at a haunted house?

307
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,170
He's so much scarier than me.

308
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,870
There's no need for him to even be here!

309
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,630
Damnit... I'm outta here!

310
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,800
Hang on there. You can't run away.

311
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,460
Weren't you going to throw your heart and soul into this?

312
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,590
Yeah but, he's way too scary.

313
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,330
One dish...

314
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,830
Two dishes, three dishes, a bunch of dishes.

315
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,540
What's this? There's one missing.

316
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,840
A curse upon you!

317
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,080
Watch out!

318
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,600
Little girl, be careful. He's gonna eat you!

319
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,950
Huh?

320
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,970
Does that monster...look scared?

321
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,450
One Frisbee, two Frisbees, a bunch of Frisbees.

322
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,690
What's this? There's one missing.

323
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,990
"I curse you...woof!"

324
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,570
He's just making stuff up as he goes!!

325
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,940
One garlic, two garlic, a bunch of garlic...

326
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,550
Garlic?! That's wrong!

327
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,660
That's your weakness!

328
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,080
You're counting your weak point!

329
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,510
What's this? There's one missing...

330
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,910
"I dracu-curse you!!"

331
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,240
That doesn't even go together!

332
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,100
And one to rule them all... "Fallen samurai," here, a snack.

333
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,580
Snack, snack.

334
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,320
Snack? What? What are they talking about?

335
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,230
Snack, snack.

336
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,820
What's this?!

337
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,120
My pockets are full of snacks...

338
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,760
Snack, snack.

339
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,330
Don't tell me they want me to count them...

340
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,340
So they want me to count these snacks that have absolutely nothing to do with me?

341
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,530
Snack, snack...

342
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,420
All right. I'll do it.

343
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,830
One snack.

344
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,850
Two snacks.

345
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,910
A bunch of snacks.

346
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,950
What's this? There's one missing...

347
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,420
[Note: "-degozaru" is a stereotypical samurai way of ending one's sentences.]

348
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,420
"I curse you -degozaru!!"

349
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,830
Well, I really enjoyed that demonstration.

350
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,740
It certainly was a great haunted house game, wasn't it? But...

351
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,220
It's wrong to take a life.

352
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,480
You almost stepped on this bug.

353
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,980
Well, "Ochi" does mean "To Fall." Yes, it does.

354
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,400
Ochi-san...

355
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,760
Welcome.

356
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,020
Oh, another customer.

357
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,640
Never mind already.

358
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,120
I've finally lost the only sanctuary I had.

359
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,160
I'll leave the rest up to you.

360
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,700
So what are you going to do now?

361
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,380
Are you just going to give up?

362
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,450
There's nothing to give up on.

363
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,600
This is the kind of life I was meant to live after all.

364
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,670
Hang on!!

365
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,070
You're running away again?

366
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,070
All you do is run away.

367
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,110
You just said the haunted house was the only place you had.

368
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,260
But that's wrong.

369
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,360
What...?

370
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,930
You always ran away without a fight and that's how you ended up here.

371
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,100
How's about taking a real stab at life, now?

372
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,540
A real stab at life?

373
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,390
Yeah, it's time for you to test your courage.

374
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,580
Ochi-san... For a man, every day is like a haunted house.

375
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,380
If we never tested our courage, we'd just rot away.

376
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,080
Our heart and soul would just die.

377
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,530
If you really want to protect the place you call your own, then

378
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,630
...throw that heart and soul into it with all your might.

379
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,740
Come on, hurry. The customer will be here any minute now.

380
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,720
Okay.

381
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,280
Here she comes...

382
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,780
A loser like me...

383
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,310
The one who kept running away from everything...

384
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,030
I can't do this after all...

385
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,820
But...

386
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,830
I don't ever want to feel that way again!

387
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,830
To the "Ochimusha" I was yesterday...

388
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,080
I'm saying goodbye!!

389
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,680
"I curse y..."

390
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,180
O...Oka...

391
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,220
Ow...Ouch...

392
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,330
Oka...Okaru...

393
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,330
O...Okaru.

394
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,500
C-Come ba-ba-ba-back to me!

395
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,120
Ouch, I bit my tongue...

396
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,070
You always bungle things...

397
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,060
Um...well...

398
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,410
You're such a fool.

399
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,310
That's why I came here.

400
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,380
Huh...

401
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,610
O-Okaru... You...

402
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,960
Don't say anything.

403
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,810
Just let me come home with you.

404
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,240
So it looks like Ochi-san was the one who brought up the separation,

405
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,910
but his wife never agreed to it.

406
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,930
Yeah, both of them were scared to be honest with each other.

407
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,570
Yeah, it looks that way.

408
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,900
Good for them.

409
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,910
Gin-chan, I want to go to the festival too.

410
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,160
What are you talking about?

411
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,870
We still have this haunted house job to finish.

412
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,580
What? We still have to do that?

413
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,830
Oh, now that I think about it, Ochi-san didn't scare anyone.

414
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,850
Whatever!

415
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,280
We're trying to make this sound like a good story at the end,

416
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,920
but don't you have a punch line or something to end with?

417
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,920
[Note: "Punch line" is "Ochi" in Japanese.]

418
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,150
No, this is the punch line: because his name is Ochi.
