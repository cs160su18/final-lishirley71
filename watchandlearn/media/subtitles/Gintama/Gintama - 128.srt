00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,240
Excuse me, are you Urara?

3
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,700
["Note from Urara" Please turn the lights on
and don't sit too close to the screen when watching TV.]

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,310
Hi, I'm Shinpachi Shimura.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,750
Why is Okita on a date
with her in my place?!

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,220
Now, now, now, calm down, Pachi.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,390
Uh...um... Excuse me.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,430
Sh-Shinpachi...

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,890
Did you just say...Shinpachi?

10
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,060
["Sometimes You Can't Tell
Just By Meeting Someone"]

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,390
I...I'm so sorry!

12
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,890
Older sister! I'm so sorry!

13
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,430
Then, you're the Shinpachi Shimura who I...my
younger sister was corresponding with?

14
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,480
I didn't mean any harm.

15
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,070
I had no intention of deceiving you.

16
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,600
I didn't have any lascivious thoughts
or anything like that!

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,120
But she was so dazzling. Your younger
sister was just so hot, so burning hot.

18
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,540
I was desperate to correspond
with a girl like her.

19
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,680
Before I knew it, I had sent
her pictures and things.

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,310
I'm the lowest! The lowest, aren't I?!

21
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,630
I'm sorry! I'll never approach
your younger sister again!

22
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,100
I know.

23
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,870
I know...that feeling.

24
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,250
Older...sister?

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,520
I'm the one...who is the lowest.

26
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,150
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

27
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,730
It's all my fault...my fault.

28
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,100
Okay, okay, okay.

29
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,220
I don't know what happened here, but
there's no need to be so serious.

30
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,490
Nothing really bad has happened
between you two yet, has it?

31
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,680
Although I wouldn't know.

32
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,970
You were the one who spearheaded
the whole thing!

33
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,180
Okay, seems this guy apparently
lied to her and stuff,

34
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,200
but it was just two young people writing
a lot of letters to each other, right?

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,270
You're the one! You're the
one who sent that photo!

36
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,410
Shut up, you!

37
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,870
Keep quiet, you coward!

38
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,620
Naturally, I'm going to give a word or two
of advice when my protégé is troubled.

39
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,770
As your mentor, and as an adult.

40
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,410
You were just killing time!

41
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,770
You understand, don't you, older sister?

42
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,530
You came today because you were worried
about your younger sister, didn't you?

43
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,710
You're shy and withdrawn, but you came out of your shell
because you were worried about your younger sister, right?

44
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,890
Isn't that wonderful? Eh, Shinpachi?

45
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,800
Th-That's not how it was.

46
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,770
I'm not so noble a person.

47
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,010
I...I...

48
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,150
No, no, no, no, no, no.

49
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,800
Get out of that mode! Stop that!

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,340
You might start feeling like you've
done something really terrible.

51
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,810
I implore you-stop doing that!

52
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,300
Let me help you.

53
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,810
Huh? With what?

54
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,310
With seducing Urara.

55
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,810
What?

56
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,560
Whaaaat?!

57
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,180
No, no, no, no, no, no!

58
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,560
What're your talking about?!

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,990
It's all wrong!

60
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,060
We were deceiving Urara.

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,670
What's more, we devised
foul plans to jump her!

62
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,560
Uh...that's why...

63
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,980
what I'm saying is, even if it's all an act,

64
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,630
I don't want that to happen
to Urara, so please use me.

65
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,100
For example, if a villain abducts me

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,880
and you save me right
before Urara's eyes...

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,860
That's a great idea.

68
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,490
No, it's not, and you know it!

69
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,710
No, it is.

70
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,160
She thinks her older sister is lost,

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,590
so a villain abducting her is good because
it goes with the natural flow.

72
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,010
That's not the point! It's an ethical issue!

73
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,310
Are you planning to add to our crimes?!

74
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,720
No problem.

75
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,530
Her older sister says it's all right.

76
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,350
You ought to try to understand
her feelings a bit.

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,970
She must have her reasons after seeing
her younger sister happily writing letters.

78
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,530
Hey, Okita-kun, change of plans.

79
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,530
Huh?

80
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,410
Don't do anything to Urara.

81
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,500
I'll play the role of the abductor and snatch
the older sister right in front of Urara,

82
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,330
so you try to stop me and attack,
but let yourself be killed.

83
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,360
At the moment everything looks hopeless

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,580
and I'm about to snatch Urara away,
Shinpachi shows up and kills me.

85
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,370
"You're so wonderful!" she'll say.

86
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,180
Got that? In other words, you
go on normal dates with her.

87
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,490
You're not doing anything
funny...to Urara, are you?

88
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,960
It's all right.

89
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,060
From the beginning,

90
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,330
wasn't it the plan for him to come
to her aid before I did anything?

91
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,190
Now that you mention it, yeah.

92
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,280
I'm escorting her around
like a gentleman.

93
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,600
She seems to be finally getting used to it.

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,130
Is that so? Then escort her like
a gentleman to my place, and...

95
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,470
Hey, don't dawdle. Walk!

96
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,770
What kind of escort are you?!

97
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,000
Eh?! You're no escort, you're
an S-cort, for sadist!

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,290
There's a delicious diner around
here. Want to go?

99
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,130
Why're you speaking normally?!

100
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,340
Why aren't you ashamed of yourself?!

101
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,650
Oh, here it is. The diner.

102
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,270
That's no diner!

103
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,340
Darn, it's full.

104
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,780
Oh, one seat's open.

105
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,330
Urara, have a bite before we get going.

106
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,400
You don't have to worry about me.

107
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,490
What kind of manners is that?!

108
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,880
It isn't "ladies first," is it now?

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,390
Absolutely not!

110
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,930
My, what fine weather.

111
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,280
Tell him something, old man!

112
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,860
Why're you making normal small talk?!

113
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,270
Yes, it is. It's already fall.

114
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,930
It's really easy to find what's
wrong with this picture!

115
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,890
Huh? Okita?

116
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,430
Huh? Something seems odd.

117
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,580
Yes, yes, that's right!

118
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,350
Huh? What? What is it?

119
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,180
Hurry up, old man! That's right! Tell him!

120
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,180
Isn't that a new mole on your forehead?
It wasn't there before.

121
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,670
Why're you noticing such
minute details?!

122
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,270
Even she hasn't noticed!

123
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,640
Isn't there something else?!

124
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,950
Old man, did you, maybe,
change cologne?

125
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,740
What's an old guy wearing cologne for?!

126
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,300
What is the relationship between
the two of you?

127
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,760
It's...It's awful. U...Urara is...Urara is...

128
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,490
Gin, in this situation, instead
of putting on a bad act,

129
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,670
I should squash Okita and save Urara!

130
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,160
Shinpachi, don't be hasty!

131
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,010
Urara!

132
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,570
My god! She's been thoroughly
disciplined!

133
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,180
She's completely submissive!

134
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,390
You jerk, what did you do
to Urara in a short time?!

135
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,450
Older sister!

136
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,390
R-Right.

137
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,350
Save me! Urara!

138
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,600
This is quite a fine young lass.
She'll fetch a pretty penny!

139
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,600
She looked this way! She
looked this way, after all!

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,180
She can't ignore the danger
her actual older sister is...

141
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,480
A mole. A mole.

142
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,940
A mole again?!

143
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,470
You jerks! How much attention are
you going to give moles, eh?!

144
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,180
What have you done to her?!

145
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,840
Before we even talk about making her fall in
love with you, her personality has changed!

146
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,290
Sorry. She awakened to her true nature
more than I thought she would.

147
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,650
But anyway, if I tell her to, she'll
fall in love with anyone.

148
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,680
No one wants such a false love!

149
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,520
I'm...sorry.

150
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,650
I'm no use to Shinpachi or Urara.

151
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,960
What am I really?

152
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm so, so sorry!

153
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,180
O-Older sister!

154
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,390
Hey, Shinpachi!

155
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,500
Come to think of it,

156
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,470
isn't today the day Shinpachi is supposed to
meet that girl he's been corresponding with?

157
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,680
How would I know. I don't remember
anything about that.

158
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,800
I hope it goes well.

159
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,680
Once he gets a girlfriend, he'll become
more forgiving of Otae.

160
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,720
I don't see Sogo.

161
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,670
I think it was a failure.

162
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,680
Sogo? Now that you mention it...

163
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,790
That was dangerous! Watch
where you're going!

164
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,380
I-I'm sorry!

165
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,120
Who was that woman?

166
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,010
Seemed like she was being chased.

167
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,100
Who are you?!

168
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
An agent of the Anti-foreigner Faction?!

169
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,560
I've secured the vehicle, Master.

170
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,100
Good, well done.

171
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,060
Okay, man, get in quickly.

172
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,300
She can be quite useful.

173
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,460
What're you guys doing?!

174
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,200
Oh... Keep up the good work.

175
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,810
You too.

176
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,700
I didn't mean that!

177
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,550
Okay, let's get going!

178
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,710
After your older sister.

179
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,720
Don't be mistaken. I serve only Master.

180
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,450
What the hell are you doing?!
Open the door! Hey!

181
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:46,310
That's...dangerous...wait...stop!

182
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,710
It's dangerous, so wait...stop!

183
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,680
Huh? You're

184
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,810
the girl in the photo who was corresponding
with Shinpachi!

185
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,010
Why?!

186
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,090
Why is she here? Wasn't she
on a date with Shinpachi?

187
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,520
Looks like the situation has changed.

188
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,510
Sorry. I wasn't the one who was
corresponding with Shinpachi.

189
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,220
What?!

190
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,810
Older sister, where are you? Older sis-

191
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,200
That's right, I don't even know
the older sister's name.

192
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,030
The older sister is Shinpachi's
real pen pal, you say?

193
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,880
Yeah. The reason why the older sister lent
us a hand to make things go well with Urara

194
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,660
was probably because she couldn't
stand it when she saw Shinpachi,

195
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,890
who completely fell in love with
Urara when he saw her photo.

196
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,490
But there was a lot of interference.

197
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,350
Stop being so insinuating.

198
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,210
It didn't go well. She blamed herself
and ran off somewhere,

199
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,590
even though both sides
deceived each other.

200
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,100
Sis, when she saw the letters,

201
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,880
that shy and withdrawn older sister of mine
said she wanted to meet Shinpachi.

202
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,850
Sis must have feelings for Shinpachi.

203
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,390
I think it must've been hard on her.

204
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,390
To think she'd try to help him find love.

205
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,600
Even so...she endured it, saying it was her
fault, and that she wasn't of use to anyone.

206
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,710
Maybe she just couldn't forgive herself.

207
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,960
What about Shinpachi?

208
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,340
He doesn't know anything.

209
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,800
He went chasing after the older
sister without knowing a thing.

210
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,830
Leaving the woman he
was aiming for behind?

211
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,340
He's not one to act on reason.

212
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,510
If there's a woman crying in front of him,

213
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,330
he's the type who would leave the woman
he loves to go and wipe those tears.

214
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,080
It's no wonder he's not
popular with women.

215
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,510
Then by now, Four-eyes must've
found that woman.

216
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,480
Give me back the car.

217
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,510
I'll arrest you for obstructing justice.

218
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,510
I don't have time to be involved
with silly puppy love.

219
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,050
Sure you do. This dude's been
totally slacking off from work.

220
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,760
Whether this guy's around or
not makes no difference.

221
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,760
This is Sis's first time in Edo. If she goes
somewhere bad and gets into trouble...

222
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,990
I don't care. Talk to me after
something happens.

223
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,660
We're not a bunch of lousy
Odd Jobs who do silly jobs.

224
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,160
Hijikata,

225
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,060
you won't have to worry about that.

226
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,920
An incident just happened.

227
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,640
What're you doing?!

228
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,830
Don't do anything stupid!

229
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,130
Urara.

230
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,770
Look at all those people.

231
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,990
As shy and withdrawn as I am...

232
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,520
As uncomfortable as I felt standing
in front of this many people...

233
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,720
I've become able to stand
before a crowd this big.

234
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,190
Ironic, isn't it?

235
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,800
Once I didn't care if I died, and it didn't
matter what happened to me.

236
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,510
I was able to change all at once,
despite how difficult it once was.

237
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,140
I guess, after all, I just cared
too much about myself.

238
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,070
I was the only one I loved and respected.

239
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,610
That's why I was afraid to know
what others thought of me.

240
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,980
I was afraid of being hurt, so I ran away and
shut myself up in my shell all the time.

241
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,570
I had the support of many people,

242
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,120
but I never thought of doing something
for someone else.

243
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,190
I only thought of myself.

244
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,850
I did the same thing with Shinpachi.

245
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,930
I sent Urara's photo because
I was afraid of being rejected.

246
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,690
Shinpachi revealed his identity to me.

247
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,700
I didn't want to be disliked.

248
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,320
So I desperately tried to hide it.

249
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,500
Yet, I felt lonely because Shinpachi
wouldn't be looking at me.

250
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,070
I didn't want him to be taken by Urara.

251
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,930
I'm filthy.

252
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm sick and tired of my filthy self.

253
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,130
Sis, wait a minute! Hear
what I have to say!

254
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,130
Forget it! Just leave me alone!

255
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,180
There, you see?

256
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,560
Didn't I tell you that blood type
[bleep] women don't listen?

257
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,720
[Broadcasting content that may encourage prejudice and
stereotypes against different blood types is prohibited.]

258
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,140
I told you this would happen.

259
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm type [peep].

260
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,130
Ouch. She heard.

261
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,890
Type [peep] is your blood type, Hijikata.

262
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,690
No wonder things turned out
the worst possible way.

263
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,940
Don't put me with the likes of her!

264
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,400
Don't judge people by their blood type!

265
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,140
Hey, stop. They're sticking in her.
They're all sticking into her.

266
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm killing myself.

267
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,880
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

268
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,320
Huh? You're type [peep]?

269
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,630
Type [peep] have lots
of good points, right?

270
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,700
Don't pass it on to me. I haven't
really even spoken to her.

271
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,440
Jerk! Aren't you type [peep]?

272
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,400
Just talk about your good points !

273
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,130
If I tell her, it'll be as though
I'm praising myself.

274
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,000
That would seem rather
strange! You tell her!

275
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,810
Why do I have to dig for good points
that you don't even have?

276
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,900
Shameless jerk!

277
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,650
Oh yeah-type peep have no shame!

278
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,580
That's right. Type peep have no shame,

279
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,020
so you could live on even if you're filthy.

280
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,240
So don't kill yourself!

281
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,060
Not helping the cause, man!

282
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,750
I'll kill myself.

283
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,560
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold
it, hold it, hold it, hold it...

284
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,490
Um, type peep are, you know, have bangs
that look like an upside-down "A," right?

285
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,740
That's a total reference to me.

286
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,350
Or rather, is that a good point?

287
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,690
It doesn't spread out,
and it doesn't dry out.

288
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,060
Are you doing a shampoo commercial?!

289
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,810
Listen, gorilla! What's the matter with
you? Help me talk her out of it!

290
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,760
Huh? Are you crying?

291
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,310
No, I'm not crying.

292
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,570
No, you are crying.

293
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,980
I said I'm not crying. Shut up!

294
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,320
What's that?

295
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,460
Nothing.

296
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,560
No, it is-could you also be...[peep]?

297
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,600
I'm killing myself!

298
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,830
Why?!

299
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,760
I didn't say anything wrong
just now, did I?

300
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,430
She clearly jumped because she realized
she and I are alike, right?

301
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,930
This is no time for that!

302
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,250
Boss!

303
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,980
Let go.

304
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,970
If you won't let go, I will.

305
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,970
Is that so Shinpachi can save you?

306
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,700
You jumped off the building
as Urara watched,

307
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,810
so that Shinpachi could come
to your rescue and look good.

308
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,970
Is that your plan?

309
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,520
Sorry, but Shinpachi isn't capable
of such acrobatics.

310
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,260
Why'd you go this far?

311
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,960
I-I'm sorry.

312
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,170
I didn't intend to jump off.

313
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,800
I just went too far, and the momentum...

314
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,900
Because they were wonderful letters.

315
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,820
From Shinpachi and everyone.

316
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,960
You all wrote them together, right?

317
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:44,640
I could tell. I've been writing
alone all my life.

318
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,840
He's clumsy and unsophisticated,

319
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,520
but he's expressive and has a
mysterious warmth about him.

320
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:58,510
The letters all of you racked your brains to
write for Shinpachi seemed to convey that.

321
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,170
Those letters weren't written to me.

322
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,430
They were written to Shinpachi,
weren't they?

323
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,700
My letters were always written to myself.

324
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,720
I asked for someone to rescue me, for
someone to extend a hand to me,

325
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,890
without ever even looking
at the other person.

326
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,510
All I ever looked at was myself.

327
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,230
There was no reason to expect a
reply to letters I wrote to myself.

328
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,530
How strange it is.

329
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,740
When a person puts a brush
to paper for herself,

330
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,740
her writing becomes timid and small,

331
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,290
but if she does it for someone else,

332
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,980
she can write wonderful words that
are stronger and more free.

333
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,600
If it's not for yourself, but for someone
else, you can become stronger.

334
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,270
Watching Shinpachi and everyone,
made me come to believe that.

335
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,330
Shinpachi made me realize
this important truth.

336
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,830
I wanted to do something for him.

337
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,840
It didn't matter if I kept the
sender anonymous.

338
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,560
Even if he didn't know
they were from me,

339
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,960
even if he kept thinking
they were from Urara,

340
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,060
I wanted to keep on writing
letters to Shinpachi.

341
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,420
But...I guess my letters
never reached him.

342
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,040
Hey.

343
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,100
Shinpachi.

344
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,350
[Tell me your name.]

345
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,850
[Next time, I want to send a letter to you.]

346
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,930
Shinpachi...

347
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,530
He knew...

348
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,110
Your letters reached him,
a long time ago.

349
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,820
Will you write him a reply?

350
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,390
[It's Kirara.]

351
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,890
[We can finally correspond
the way we should, Kirara.]

352
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,650
Shin, I brought sweets.

353
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,330
Oh, he's napping. What a mess.

354
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:17,670
[Preview]

355
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,190
Two forces that have fought continuously
since ancient times.

356
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,100
That's right! The Dog Faction
and the Cat Faction!

357
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,140
Neither is good.

358
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,120
Neither is cute.

359
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,170
The next episode:

360
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,710
"Beware of Food You Pick
Up Off the Ground"

361
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,260
[Again, Sadaharu suffers a loss of appetite. A worried Kagura (and Odd Jobs) take him to the veterinary hospital.]

362
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,100
[There, they meet a mangy old dog, "Kintaro"...]
