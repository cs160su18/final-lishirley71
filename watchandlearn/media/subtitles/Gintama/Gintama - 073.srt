[OTOSE SNACK HOUSE]

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
Edited at https://subtitletools.com

3
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,670
Otose-san, did you hear?

4
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,340
It seems we had a lot of complaints about last week's episode.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,690
Well, GinTama will be off the air soon.

6
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,240
It won't be easy keeping GinTama on the air if it makes an enemy out of the PTA.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,300
It happened when they cast a naturally wavy-haired guy,

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,660
a beastly girl and a stupid four-eyes as the main characters.

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,700
That's right.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,740
It's an aging society with a falling birth rate.

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,610
From now on, it'll be an anime for senior citizens.

12
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,440
A mature woman like me would be a great main character.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,300
Please consider a cat-eared woman as a mascot.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,580
It's a deal. It'll be a new show starting in the fall season.

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,170
Catherine, go collect the last rent payment from those guys.

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,120
All right. I'm going!

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,280
[Entering the mountains to look for matsutake mushrooms... Gintoki and the others feel like they're on a picnic.]

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,050
[Blame the Odd Jobs Trio... Who's this mysterious man?!]

19
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,090
Sakata-san, Sakata-san.

20
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,590
I came to collect the rent for Otose-san.

21
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,300
Please open up. I know you're there.

22
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,690
Sakata-san, stupid Sakata-san.

23
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,700
Ah, that's why I told you we should've gotten an earlier start.

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,770
Shh, be quiet. Erase any traces of your presence.

25
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,240
And become one with nature.

26
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,680
You're part of the universe, and the universe is a part of you.

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,650
The universe is a part of me? That's great!

28
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,330
All my worries will become insignificant!

29
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,320
You're too loud! Be quiet!

30
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,950
You're the loudest one here!

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,610
No! Your punch line is the loudest!

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,550
It got quiet all of a sudden. Did she leave?

33
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,230
I'm as excited as if we were on a school trip.

34
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,260
Wait.

35
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,340
Open sesame!

36
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,760
Let's go.

37
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Ah, wait...

38
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,860
Catherine's specialty is "lock picking."

39
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,760
Even if you hid in a safe box, you couldn't escape her.

40
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,760
O-Otose-san...

41
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Call me "Latchkey Catherine."

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,290
Hey, mop head! Today I'm collecting my rent from you!

43
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,400
If you don't have any money, earn some by selling your organs or your balls!

44
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,480
You bastard!

45
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,670
Now!

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,410
Otose-san! Otose-san!

47
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,120
Hey, pay me the rent!

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,560
Gin-san, is it true we can gather enough matsutake mushrooms to pay the rent?

49
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,240
Otherwise, we won't be able to come back.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,160
Don't worry. Believe in what I say.

51
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,390
Whoa!

52
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,780
Mushroom Hunting!!

53
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,930
["Think for a Minute Now, Do Matsutake Mushrooms Really Taste All That Good?"]

54
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,750
People often compare climbing a mountain to life.

55
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,250
Accomplishing something in life is like reaching the top of the mountain.

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,960
But mountains...

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,060
...aren't that simple.

58
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,470
If you don't have some place to come back to, you'll die in a ditch.

59
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,750
Once you've come back down the mountain,

60
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,090
you can say you've really accomplished something.

61
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,290
Everybody, come over!

62
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,990
[Note: Spoof of a Drifters comedy sketch.]

63
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,990
Line up!

64
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,780
Listen up!

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,220
Don't expect to be climbing down any mountains until we find some Matsutake mushrooms!

66
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,640
Mountain climbing doesn't end until you return home and say, "I'm back."

67
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,620
Don't get so excited! The mountain is always playing tricks on you!

68
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,240
What kind of mountain tricks?

69
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,470
What?! That's uh... They're similar to the tricks of summer.

70
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,760
It's like: Don't follow suspicious strangers when having fun at the beach.

71
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,600
Or like the warnings you hear in homeroom right before summer vacation...

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,110
You're the one who's the most excited, Gin-san.

73
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,650
You guys...this mountain is dangerous. Climb back down as soon as possible.

74
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,900
Really... In autumn, there're so many people who don't understand the harsh dangers of nature.

75
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,820
Well, but I...

76
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,770
...came here without knowing anything, either. I never thought I...

77
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,400
Hey, you! What the hell are you doing?!

78
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,330
Well, you know... I drank too much yesterday, so I thought I might return to the natural world.

79
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,010
And I exposed the lower half of my body so I can feel at one with nature.

80
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,600
You should return to the soil!

81
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,320
Ah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, somehow!

82
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,720
What do you mean "somehow"? You should feel completely sorry!

83
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,530
Gin-chan!

84
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,000
Huh?

85
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,130
Is this a matsutake mushroom?

86
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,980
No, no. That's the kiddy size.

87
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,370
The adult version looks much bigger.

88
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,600
Like about 30cm?

89
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,260
Well... I want to say that. But it makes me feel like I'm showing off...

90
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,490
Huh?

91
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,050
Ow, ow, ow!

92
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:52,750
You guys will be in danger if you don't climb down the mountain like I said.

93
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,990
In danger...

94
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,830
It doesn't sound too convincing when you were the one that got stuck on my hook.

95
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,170
Anyway, believe me. You should go home as soon as possible.

96
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,790
Who's that guy?

97
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,860
Was he trying to warn us about something?

98
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,520
I don't know...

99
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,720
Forget about that guy, and let's go find some matsutake mushrooms!

100
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,090
Oi!

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,920
No, no, no, no! Just look at it! It's obviously poisonous!

102
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,310
Don't make me repeat myself.

103
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,780
The uglier something looks, the better it tastes.

104
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,850
Like salted fish guts and crab guts.

105
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,400
But that weird color is a warning.

106
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,170
It's like, "I'm poisonous, so don't even get close to me."

107
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on, it's always the edgiest, scariest guys who turn out to be the biggest teddy bears.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,650
You saw that scene where the juvenile delinquent picks up an abandoned kitten

109
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,030
and protects it in his school uniform in the rain, right?

110
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,380
It's kind of a tradition in this country.

111
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,690
I've never seen anything like that.

112
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,630
In spring, he bumps into a girl on the street corner

113
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,190
who has bread in her mouth on the morning of the school's opening ceremony...

114
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,010
In rainy season, a juvenile delinquent puts an abandoned kitten in his school uniform...

115
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,780
And in fall, it's time for love confessions at the annual school festival.

116
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,920
Those are the traditions created by our ancestors.

117
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,100
What kind of four seasons are you talking about?!

118
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,630
Am I right, Sadaharu?

119
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,900
Oh, that smells good!

120
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,060
This is an excellent quality mushroom, even better than matsutake mushrooms.

121
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,440
You're amazing, Gin-san.

122
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,120
Why are you doing your own dubbing? He obviously rejected it.

123
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,000
Shut up, four-eyes! Don't talk back to Gin-san.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,850
After all, you've only eaten shiitake mushrooms, huh?

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,850
[Note: A shiitake mushroom is an ordinary mushroom, less expensive than a matsutake mushroom.]

126
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,670
[Note: Nameko is a small, amber-brown mushroom. It's even less expensive than shiitake mushrooms.]

127
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,460
How about you? You can only afford to eat nameko soup, right?

128
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,670
You dirt-poor samurai!

129
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,620
Gin-chan! Shinpachi! Look! Look!

130
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,630
Here, I found a big one, uh-huh.

131
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,380
Can we eat this, too?

132
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,040
Wh-Where did you pick up something like that?! Don't get so close!

133
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,600
Go back to where you came from and take it with you!

134
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,480
And marry it so it won't come back!

135
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,820
Oh, my! You two are really excited. Don't worry we'll split it equally.

136
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,550
I don't want any part of that!

137
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,430
What is it, anyway? Is it dead?

138
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,820
I don't know.

139
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,160
Well, it was just lying over there.

140
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,060
I told you to stop picking up everything.

141
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,640
This is a bear, right? It has a mushroom growing on its head.

142
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,530
That's because it didn't use its brain much.

143
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,470
You know Kishibe-san, who lives on 3rd Street?

144
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,310
That old man had one on his head, too.

145
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,080
Is that right? I'd better be careful.

146
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,880
These wounds...don't look like they were inflicted by a hunter...

147
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,050
Like that man suggested, maybe we should climb down the mountain.

148
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,040
Idiot! Don't lose your nerve!

149
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,820
We haven't even found a single matsutake mushroom.

150
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,130
You know, "Unless you enter the tiger's den, you cannot steal her cubs."

151
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,420
How can we pick mushrooms if we're afraid of bears, damn it?!

152
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,300
How can you have an affair if you're scared of your wife, damn it?!

153
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Matsutake, la la la...

154
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,110
Gin-san... Look up! Up there!

155
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,340
Matsutake...

156
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,720
No! No way! Playing dead doesn't work!

157
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,630
It's just an old wives' tale. Superstition!

158
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,530
Gin-chan, he's saying it's a superstition.

159
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,430
Ah, that's not fair! You are playing dead without me.

160
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,130
Mr. Bear, this guy is still alive!

161
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,900
See, he's still alive!

162
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,560
Don't talk so loud!

163
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,360
If you focus on pretending to be dead, it'll work, even on a bear.

164
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,130
Okay. G'night, Gin-chan.

165
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,040
Gin-san! Kagura-chan!

166
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,160
Hey, hey, playing dead nowadays... You guys are really old-fashioned.

167
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,330
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

168
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,030
Time out, time out!

169
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,630
Ah...

170
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,040
Yo! Over here!

171
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,860
That bear is Masamune.

172
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,720
In other words, he's in charge of this mountain.

173
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,240
I wonder who you are...

174
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,100
The name's Marinosuke. I'm hunting him.

175
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,000
Ah? Mushroom hunting?

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,710
Don't you know how dangerous this mountain is?

177
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,990
You're only saying that because you want the matsutake mushrooms all to yourself!

178
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,660
Kagura-chan, how can you say something like that to someone who rescued us?!

179
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,860
Marinosuke-san, please come over and have some food.

180
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,590
That huge bear you said was in charge of the mountain... Did something happen to it?

181
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,550
As you saw...

182
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,600
There's a strange mushroom on Masamune's head.

183
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,220
I don't know which planet it came from,

184
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,840
but anyone infected by that parasitic mushroom becomes its living food source.

185
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,020
You lose control of yourself

186
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,760
and turn into a ravenous monster that lives to fulfill the appetite of that mushroom.

187
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,340
The dead bear you saw was probably killed by Masamune.

188
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,130
It even kills fellow bears...

189
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,770
I heard it ravaged the crops and ate people in the village at the foot of the mountain.

190
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,900
The damage was devastating.

191
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,030
So, that's why I'm here.

192
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm really good at this and the only one who can handle that huge bear.

193
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,600
Are you doing it for a reward? How much would you get if you beat him?

194
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,750
It's not like that.

195
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,880
Let's just say...he and I go way back.

196
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,030
If there's such a monster here, it's a lousy time to be matsutake mushroom hunting.

197
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,550
We have no other choice but to climb down the mountain!

198
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,450
But Gin-san! There's a mushroom growing on your head!

199
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,130
Huh?

200
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,750
Whoa!

201
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,980
It's because you're not using your head enough every day.

202
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,490
Hey, you've got one, too!

203
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,140
And, what?! Me, too?!

204
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,350
I told you. You've all been infected by the parasite.

205
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,190
This is what happens when amateurs go where they don't belong.

206
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,380
So do you!

207
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,640
What?! Why?! Hey, you guys, what did you put in this soup?!

208
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,870
That's impolite! You criticizing my cooking?!

209
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,920
You don't have many opportunities to eat a mushroom growing on a bear's head, uh-huh!

210
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,520
Why did you do that?!

211
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,020
How could you put a mushroom growing out of a corpse into the pot!

212
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,800
This is terrible! What's gonna happen to us?!

213
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,260
If we don't do something, we'll end up like that bear.

214
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,990
Right. If we don't do something, we'll end up in Mario's World.

215
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,500
No, that's not right.

216
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,330
If everything goes well, we'll be in the next Mario series.

217
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,420
No, we won't!

218
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,420
Mamma Mia!

219
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,830
But there's no need to panic.

220
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,120
If you get treated in the village during the early stages, you'll be okay.

221
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,680
Until then, don't touch the mushroom on your head.

222
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,890
Listen to what I say!

223
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,230
Whoa! It multiplied!

224
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,160
Hey, why are you smiling? It's not like you're better because you have more.

225
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,440
Marinosuke-san, what should we do?

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,360
Can do you something about it?! You can do something about it, right?!

227
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
Don't talk to me like I'm Professor Mushroom or something!

228
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,090
No way! This is terrible! Why does he have to show up now?!

229
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,960
This may be our last meal. We might as well eat.

230
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,970
That's my ambition, to die with a full stomach.

231
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,130
Why are you eating at a time like this?!

232
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,420
This is why amateurs keep my hands full.

233
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,800
Marinosuke-san!

234
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,620
I can take care of this myself. You guys head down to the village.

235
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,230
This fight is just between us. I don't need any help.

236
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,400
Right, Masamune?

237
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,180
Go now! Hurry up!

238
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,140
B-But...Gin-san.

239
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,840
Whoa! They're multiplying somehow!

240
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,500
It's like "infinite 1-UP" I feel like, even if I die, I can be revived!

241
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,190
I hope you die then!

242
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,920
Hey, four-eyes! Quickly get those fools outta here! Or it'll be too late.

243
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,200
All right.

244
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,310
Marinosuke-san! You better not die!

245
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,330
Who knows...

246
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,440
Sorry for making you wait, Masamune.

247
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,170
Either I pull this trigger or you'll take off my head...

248
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,500
Fight me!

249
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,370
Now!

250
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,130
Damn it...

251
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,900
Hey, hey, hey, where are you taking me?

252
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,760
Let me go. I gotta settle this with him once and for all.

253
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,610
What are you thinking?! Do you want to die?!

254
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,760
Shut up! Leave me alone! This has nothing to do with you guys.

255
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,120
He's coming!

256
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,770
Gin-san! Over there!

257
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,210
What's going on? I thought you guys went down the mountain!

258
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,780
We can climb down the mountain anytime.

259
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:56,290
But we just couldn't leave a guy who can't even climb down his own mountain.

260
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,560
You're saying... I climbed up my mountain, but can't climb down?

261
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,300
That might be true.

262
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,640
It's true that I climbed this mountain by myself...

263
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,920
And it was different from any mountain I've climbed before...

264
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,110
A long time ago there was a village of hunters.

265
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,050
They lived in harmony with nature.

266
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,610
Thus, they had a great respect for nature over all other things.

267
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,080
The village had rules.

268
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,560
Other than the scared hunt, interfering with the natural cycle of life and death was forbidden.

269
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,000
And you couldn't kill or come to anything's rescue.

270
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,690
But there was a man who was swayed by his emotions and broke that rule.

271
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,020
The man felt happy.

272
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,290
He'd never known anything but "Sacred killing"...

273
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,830
But now he'd saved a life, no matter how small...

274
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,050
And the man realized

275
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,310
that he was being supported by that small life...

276
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,080
But the pact-keepers showed no mercy and ripped that small life away from him.

277
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,510
The man was overwhelmed by rage and grief, but couldn't do anything.

278
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,270
From that day on, he was unable to raise his gun at anything ever again.

279
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:33,720
And one day, the man heard a rumor about a huge one-eyed bear laying waste to a village.

280
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,550
It doesn't look like it'll last long...

281
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,000
Both this tree and us.

282
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,680
He's taking his revenge against humans.

283
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,430
For the way they'd torn his parents from him and then mercilessly discarded him.

284
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,740
The foolish man who turned him into such a monster was me.

285
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,670
So the least I can do is try to kill him, or die by his hand... That's all I can do.

286
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,230
But no matter how many times I tried, I couldn't pull the trigger.

287
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:14,120
I believed that it was the right thing to climb this mountain, but I don't know how to climb down.

288
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,990
And so I might as well...

289
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,900
It wouldn't be so bad if I died in a ditch atop the mountain.

290
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,400
You've got it wrong.

291
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:29,270
Nobody knows where to go back down after they've climbed up the mountain. However...

292
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,590
...if you don't climb down, you won't know if you can ever climb another mountain.

293
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,770
If you want to die in a ditch, you can do it after you climb down this mountain, okay?

294
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,050
You...

295
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,530
Whoa! It's the end!

296
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,010
Move!

297
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,030
No effect at all, eh?

298
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,010
I guess the only way to save you is to blow that mushroom off your head.

299
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,480
Masamune!

300
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,960
Did I end it...?

301
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,480
You guys...

302
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,490
Marinosuke-san!

303
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,340
Masamune...

304
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,470
Forgive me...

305
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,760
Goodbye, Masamune.

306
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,680
It looks like I've caused you nothing but trouble.

307
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,500
What are you guys going to do now?

308
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,320
Well, we're tired of mushroom hunting.

309
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,510
We'll go grape picking next!

310
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,130
You guys will never learn.

311
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,510
...So, what are you going to do?

312
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,290
Finally, I climbed down my mountain.

313
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,960
I'll look for my next mountain and live freely.

314
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,880
I'll live for him, too.

315
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:41,870
[Preview]

316
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,770
Wow, "Kochikame" has been running for 31 years already.

317
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,770
[Note: Kochikame (Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo) is the longest-running manga series in history.]

318
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:41,670
I hope GinTama lasts that long and becomes a national manga and they build a statue of me.

319
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,670
The next episode… "The Manga Writer Becomes a Pro, After Doing a Stock of Manuscripts."

320
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,960
Well, next is the King Kong twosome. Thanks.

321
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,820
Well, next is the King Kong twosome. Thanks.

322
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,500
Oops! It looks like I've arrived at the wrong time.

323
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,150
Sensei, please stop acting so blatant in trying to fill time.

324
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,950
I already told you this isn't a cigarette. It's a lollipop.

325
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,520
Don't try to laugh it off!

326
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,450
It's smoking because I’m licking it so fast.

327
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,360
Finally… Next is the King Kong twosome. Thanks.

328
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:39,990
