00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,160
To celebrate the Gintama anime becoming a movie
& breaking roughly one million in DVD sales,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,480
we held the second character
popularity poll.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,090
However, someone unsatisfied
with the results

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,780
attacked Yamazaki-san in 9th
place to slide the ranking.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,080
This caused the girls, led by my sister,
to go for the kill before being killed.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,950
Hideaki Sorachi, the original author at 15th
place, was the first to be taken out.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,330
[Please wait one moment.]

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,380
Then the anime staff attempted
to cancel this week's episode

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,300
using the author's absence
as an excuse.

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,180
But such scene does not exist
in last week's episode...

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,120
With the original author gone,
what will happen to this show?

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,990
And how are we suppose to pull off
another 30 minute show this week?!

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,280
The screen's back to normal somehow.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,030
That gorilla author must have
recovered after a week.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,440
That's a relief.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,950
At the very least, this show won't be
canceled because the author died.

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,400
In any case, I must get
to Gin-san quickly...

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,920
I can't let this popularity poll...

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,000
No...

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,250
I cannot allow those wretched fiends to have their
way with this distorted, yet beautiful world!

Sorachi's been turned into a cyborg!

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,440
Sorachi, you managed to survive,

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,020
but your style turned into someone
completely different!

42
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,860
And the drawings are too detailed!

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,250
We won't last to the end of our
fourth season at this rate!

I appreciate Mr. Gudonson for
helping out with the story,

45
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,450
but he obviously has no clue
to what this show's about!

46

some of the manga?!

That's not what I meant when
I said read the damn manga!

52

It's not about matching up the opening
narration and the teaser!

What?! Another change?!

54

Are the artist and original author
fighting over the theme?!

What is the editor doing?!

59
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,600
The artist and author would always
get into a fight if they meet!

60
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,620
That's why the editor is suppose to act as
the mediator so things can go smoothly!

that you're happy to be in 3rd.

But say that you're still happy.

153
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,590
Cut it out!

154
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,590
Say it, Hijikata.

155
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,450
You should be able to say it, Hijikata.

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,070
Despite all that talk, they
care about their ranking.

163
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,620
What's so great about being 1st or 2nd?

164
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,580
This old man can't understand.

165
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,190
Yeah, no kidding.

166
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,210
Once you're our age, that
stuff no longer matters.

167
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,890
I'd be completely fine with a low ranking.

168
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,400
And there wouldn't be much difference
if I was 1st or 2nd.

169
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,530
Yeah, it's just a cheap ranking
based off of looks.

170
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,390
Quite frankly, they can do
whatever they want.

171
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,400
That's not what we're focused on.

172
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,930
I mean, can you be happy about a high
ranking for such superficial reasons?

173
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,740
I don't get it.

174
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,730
I could rank higher if I really wanted to.

175
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,740
But I'm purposely not doing that.

176
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,510
After all, I could dress myself
up to rank higher,

177
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,520
but that wouldn't feel right, yeah?

178
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,240
You want to be cool on the inside.

179
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,540
They can play that game if they want.

180
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,400
We're going all-natural.

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,560
Honestly...

182
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,660
It's a little annoying when
they arbitrarily rank us.

183
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,760
I'm all, don't lump me
with the rest of them!

184
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
I'm all, don't vote for me!

185
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,620
I'm probably happier with a lower rank.

186
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,150
Man, I know what you mean.

187
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,790
Seriously, only a few can understand.

188
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,140
I mean, just look.

189
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,140
I don't understand how he's 4th.

190
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,790
This guy hasn't done anything!

191
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,420
He's in 4th by wrapping a
bandage around his head!

192
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,610
There probably isn't any
real reason for it.

193
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,200
It's a fashion statement.

194
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,240
Yeah, you've got that right.

195
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,840
Mine is just a pink eye, by the way.

196
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,420
And Kagura's big brother at 7th.

197
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,050
I don't understand this one either.

198
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,120
He came out of nowhere and he's 7th?

199
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,710
Isn't he a bad guy?

200
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,550
He's just wearing a Chinese outfit.

201
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,060
You're right!

202
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,250
Absolutely right!

203
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,260
In my case, the Shinsengumi's
having Chinese Outfit Day.

204
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,640
To be honest, it's a pain when these other
characters kinda overlap with mine.

205
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,390
Overlap? Aren't they ripoffs?

206
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,870
They're total ripoffs of
our characters, yeah?

207
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,160
We showed up first!

208
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I don't care about the ranking, but
we need to make this clear!

209
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,170
That's right!

210
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,970
I don't want the audience to
think that we're the ripoffs!

211
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,810
Would you cut it out already?

212
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,200
Now is not the time to argue about who
did the ripping off, or who was ripped off,

213
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,710
...or how I've been cuffed up.

214
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,870
Katsura-san!

215
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,700
It doesn't matter if we're the
Anti-Foreigner Faction or Shinsengumi.

216
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,210
Now is the time to unite and
deal with this situation!

217
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,010
Why can't you understand?!

218
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,940
Why won't you uncuff me?!

219
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,530
Cowards...

220
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,300
Are you so scared of a wounded beast?

221
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,010
It's true that if I wasn't wounded,

222
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,400
I wouldn't have been caught
by dogs of the Bakufu.

223
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,290
Katsura-san, then those
injuries are from...?!

224
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,940
I can no longer judge who
is friend and who is foe.

225
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,990
No place is safe in this world...

226
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,820
Katsura-san, there's something
wrong with that flashback.

227
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,370
No place is safe?

228
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,030
Isn't that a safari park?

229
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,540
You got injured riding a
bicycle through there?

230
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,560
The nightmare began when I decided that
I wanted to see those paws close-up.

231
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,250
Curses...

232
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,720
Curses, my ass!

233
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,620
You're an idiot!

234
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,480
You've done this before, haven't you?!

235
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,310
I don't care what happens!

236
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,610
You can all...

237
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,900
You can all die covered by paws!

238
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,080
You can die by yourself.

239
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,840
You can die by yourself
from a separate case.

240
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,980
Anyway, where's Elizabeth-san?

241
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,170
Don't tell me you ditched
Elizabeth-san and ran.

242
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,550
Uh, sorry...

243
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,180
I think I just saw something
I wasn't supposed to.

244
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,450
I just saw mascots in a bloody
battle for supremacy.

245
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,880
So here we have eight people
plus two pets from the top 20.

246
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,590
Well, I'm guessing that nobody in the
room is going to do any backstabbing.

247
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,300
You'll pay for that once we get back.

248
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,300
Um... I'm pretty worried about that.

249
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,800
They're all people who don't know
how to hold back their anger.

250
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,490
That's it, Sadaharu!

251
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,500
Anyway, we'll be hiding out in this
hotel until everything's over.

252
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,900
The manager here's an
old friend of mine.

253
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,270
I've explained everything.

254
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,010
We won't need to worry.

255
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,670
We'll want to stay put until the
excitement's died down.

256
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,640
Excitement?

257
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,940
When are they going to calm down?

258
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,290
Hell, are you even sure that
they're going to calm down?

259
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:49,670
I have to wait around with a bunch
of pests for god knows how long?

260
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,720
Hijikata-san, a popularity poll

261
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,700
can only work when lots
of readers participate.

262
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,680
Don't you find it wrong when people
try to twist that for personal gain?

263
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,050
We have a duty to protect our own rank.

264
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,180
Aren't we obligated to protect the
number that's been given to us?

265
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,400
Well, a secondary main character doesn't
want to be any lower than 8th.

266
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,120
That'd be pathetic.

267
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,830
You don't want to drop any lower, yeah?

268
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,960
In fact, 8th is already pretty bad.

269
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,130
Really bad. A real shame.

270
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,110
I was wondering if I'd done
something wrong.

271
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,900
That's not what I mean!

272
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,800
I was unhappy in the beginning.

273
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,750
I thought that popularity
polls shouldn't exist.

I'm sure we can do this

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,200
Of course we can.

286

If you can't guard a castle with
this lot, it's a lost cause.

a fight if it's collapsing from the inside.

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:19,130
I went to Gin-san and the other higher ranked members
believing they wouldn't plan anything bad,

305
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,340
but it wasn't any different
from the outside.

being driven by a different greed.

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,480
Hasn't she noticed the trouble going on?

319
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,400
Should I call Tsukuyo-san over here?

320
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,190
No, I'm not sure that it'd be safer here.

321
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,950
That's...!

322
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,030
Sis!

323
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,470
Then starting from episode 182...

324
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,950
She shouldn't need any
more screen time...

325
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,770
That's right!

326
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,320
They're after Tsukuyo-san!

327
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,660
Tsukuyo-san's in danger!

328
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,510
But if I call to her now,

329
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,690
it'll also draw in those wild beasts!

330
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,570
What do I do...?

331
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,620
Do I leave her out to dry?

332
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,660
What do I do?

333
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,750
What should I do...?!

334
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,190
Tsukuyo-san! Look out!

335
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,230
Ah, sorry about that.

336
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,750
It's no use! It's too late!

337
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,690
She didn't hear me!

338
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,980
Hold it right there!

339
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,590
Hey, big girl...

340
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,570
Wh-What do you think you're doing?

341
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,830
The Boss Lady's 15th has fallen off!

342
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,570
Ah! It's a hit-and-run scam!

343
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,870
How are you gonna make up
for this, you stupid idiot?!

344
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,240
That's such a yakuza trick!

345
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,340
They're being nothing but a yakuza!

346
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,910
Look, the Boss Lady's 15th
has been scratched!

347
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,090
You won't be able to pay
your way out of this one!

348
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,720
What ya gonna do?!

349
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,510
How did it get scratched?!

350
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,510
I mean, those things are detachable?!

351
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,100
Forgive me.

352
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,970
I wasn't paying attention.

353
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,740
I'll wash it and return it.

354
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,930
I'm sorry, Tsukuyo-san!

355
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,260
It was my fault!

356
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,220
You won't be able to wash away the dirt
that's been thrown onto our emblem.

357
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,810
Could you come down
to the office with us?

358
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,020
Emblem?! That's a emblem?!

359
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,570
Sarutobi, Kyubei.

360
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,230
That's enough.

361
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,130
That young lady didn't do it on purpose.

362
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,600
It's despicable to bully
an honest girl like that.

363
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,190
But, Boss Lady!

364
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,800
Forgive the disturbance
my young girls caused.

365
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,470
I've done you wrong.

366
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,520
It seems that you've lost
something important...

367
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,920
It doesn't matter.

368
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,420
Don't worry about it.

369
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,360
I was going to clean up from
this business anyway.

370
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Boss Lady?!

371
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,570
A half-assed 15th sign won't
get me anywhere.

372
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,050
Our methods are too old.

373
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,220
I already realized that.

374
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,370
But I kept thinking they might
sell character goods,

375
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,330
or release character songs,

376
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,550
or let us form a unit like
PRINCESS PRINCESS,

377
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,550
[Note: PRINCESS PRINCESS, or Puri-Puri,
was a Japanese girl band from the 80's.]

378
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,950
and kept hoping and hoping...

379
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,980
The next thing I know, we're already
half way done with the fourth season.

380
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,030
But even Puri-Puri was unable
to beat the new wave.

381
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,030
Puri-Puri's time is over...

382
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,120
This is a new age...

383
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,010
Yes...

384
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,840
The age of you, the Perfume.

385
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,840
[Note: Perfume is a Japanese
female technopop group.]

386
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,590
Thanks to you, I no longer
have any regrets.

387
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,240
I finally disband the group.

388
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,850
Thank you for the guidance.

389
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,440
I leave the rest to you.

390
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,110
Electro-on for our sake.

391
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,700
Ah, wait up.

392
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,310
I found this lying around.

393
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,200
Does it belong to you?

394
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,760
She snapped it off!

395
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,300
Tsukuyo-san snapped
her own ranking off!

396
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,330
Uh, isn't that yours...?

397
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,230
No, it was just lying there.

398
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,600
Hey, Tsukuyo-san!

399
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,080
Just lying there? You're bleeding.

400
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,890
Your tore it off, so there's
blood everywhere.

401
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,700
I just fell over there.

402
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,840
Don't worry about it.

403
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,740
It's okay, Tsukuyo-san!

404
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,460
You don't need to be considerate
to that lot!

405
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,230
Young lady, I appreciate the thought,
but I can't accept that.

406
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,640
Puri-Puri still has its pride.

407
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,300
Pride as hard as a diamond.

408
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,830
Besides, it wouldn't matter
if I became 9th by myself.

409
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,900
That won't be enough to feed our bunch.

410
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,040
Boss Lady... Isn't there a way?

411
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,450
A way for all of us to become 9th?

412
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,870
Don't be foolish.

413
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,160
It's okay.

414
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,080
Electro-on the diamonds for our sake.

415
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,610
Oh, wait up.

416
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,690
This broke into four pieces
after I dropped it.

417
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,760
She shattered it!

418
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,510
Now she shattered her ranking
into four pieces!

419
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,840
Perhaps we can all be 9th
if we divide this among us?

420
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,810
I really doubt that.

421
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,050
It'd be a stretch...

422
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,910
Wait! Hold it right there!

423
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,350
That won't do! That can't work!

424
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,580
Then how about this, Boss Lady?

425
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,700
The four of us can join together as
Diamond Perfume at 9th place.

426
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,370
Who are you calling Perfume?!

427
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,480
That's allowed?!

428
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,000
You can do that?!

429
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,210
That's great. I love that.

430
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,720
A brilliant idea, Kyubei.

431
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,710
Hey, Boss Lady. We can electro-on too?

432
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,930
We can also do the really
bad robot-dance?!

433
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,720
I-I don't believe this...

434
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,910
I didn't expect them to conquer their target
without a single drop of blood shed...

435
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,600
They climbed up to 9th by absorbing
instead of destroying...

436
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,900
They're nowhere as cute as Perfume...

437
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,740
They're...

438
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,680
They're...

439
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,750
They're...!

440
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,410
Vacuum!

441
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,300
A terrible vampire unit which absorbs everything
to become their own flesh, Vacuum!

442
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,780
That's right.

443
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,390
It wouldn't be right with
only the four of us.

444
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,270
We should also invite Kagura-chan.

445
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,120
6th!

446
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,480
Now they intend to absorb 6th place!

447
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,210
This won't do!

448
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,160
I can't let them have their way!

449
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,690
I have to tell everyone!

450
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,150
They saw me!

451
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,870
I've been noticed by Vacuum!

452
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,890
This is bad!

453
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,230
They're barging in!

454
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,750
This place will be a battlefield soon!

455
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,890

in preparation!

This isn't the time to be fighting
among ourselves!

459
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,680
