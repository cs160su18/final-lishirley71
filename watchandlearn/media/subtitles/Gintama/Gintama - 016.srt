00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,390
Hey! What's going on, brother?

160
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,090
I'm not your brother! I'm Katsura!

161
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,610
All right. I know, already!

162
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,600
The game is about over, bomber!

163
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,970
Whatever.

164
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,130
Come on! Why don't you confess?!

165
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,600
I already said that I have nothing to do with it.

166
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,080
I understand. So just tell us where Katsura is hiding.

167
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,230
You really don't understand what I said!

168
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,910
You know, you don't have any identification and you keep insisting that you're not involved.

169
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,390
Because of that, we can't help but suspect you.

170
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm telling you, I'm Hasegawa, and I used to work at the Department of Immigration Control.

171
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,020
You'd know if you checked!

172
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,320
If you are going to lie, at least make it believable.

173
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,620
No, it's true, already!

174
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,790
Then we'll strip you and check!

175
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,330
Take off your sunglasses. Your sunglasses!

176
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,500
Hold on a minute! Not my sunglasses!

177
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,640
Hopefully not my clothes, either! Believe me, I used to work at the Department of Immigration Control!

178
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,510
You know, you're a Deceiving Overprotected Red-handed Kook, in short, DORK.

179
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,020
[Investigation room]

180
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,020
Take your clothes off, now!

181
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,020
After all, I'm a DORK no matter where I go.

182
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,330
No, not those!

183
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,020
Give up, old man!

184
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,250
Don't come back!

185
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,680
I guess we got up early this morning for nothing.

186
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,030
So true.

187
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,270
The only thing I had left were these sunglasses.

188
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,740
Hey! You'd better listen to me!

189
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,500
Hey, what are you doing here?

190
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,870
I see. Your interview didn't go well again.

191
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,760
Right, they totally shot me down.

192
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,510
In fact, I was tangled up with so many strange guys...

193
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,750
Every one of them called me a DORK and wanted me to take off my sunglasses.

194
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,750
These sunglasses are a part of my face.
There's no way I can take them off.

195
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,650
Dumbass! Stop blaming everything on your sunglasses!

196
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,430
Do you blame a rock when you trip over it? Does it change anything?

197
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,640
Well, all you need to do is take off your sunglasses.

198
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,380
Heh... You're saying it's because of my sunglasses that I can't change myself?

199
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,660
You think I can change myself at this age?

200
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,890
That's enough. Sit down.

201
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,340
Hey, Master. Give him something that reminds him of his mother's cooking.

202
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,900
Now how the hell do I do that?

203
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:06,320
[Oden]

204
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,970
Speaking of his mother's cooking, there's nothing better than Digestive Biscuits!

205
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,320
What kind of mother are you talking about?!

206
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,420
Hasegawa-san, It's okay to have a code of honor...and live by it...

207
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,050
But if you can't get anywhere because of it,

208
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,120
it might not be a bad idea to reverse course.

209
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,270
Why not break all the rules?

210
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,380
Along the way, there'll come a point when you finally find something that matters to you

211
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,420
more than your code, right?

212
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,080
After that, you can wear your sunglasses as much as you want.

213
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,090
And I...

214
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,130
I'm Taizo Hasegawa. Nice to meet you.

215
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,380
I've finally taken off my sunglasses.

216
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,280
What kind of work did you do before, Hasegawa-san?

217
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,480
I was fighting against evil aliens to save Earth.

218
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,760
You're so funny.

219
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,740
We'll hire you.

220
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,080
I didn't realize that just taking off my sunglasses could make this much difference in my life.

221
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,250
I hate doing what young people tell me to, but now I think it has nothing to do with age.

222
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,840
Even people who haven't lived as long as me know more about life.

223
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,570
Sir, where to?

224
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,900
Don't call him sir! Call him President!

225
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,740
Huh?

226
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,100
Cut it out, guys! Sorry, Driver. Please take us to the Cultural Center.

227
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,930
All right, President.

228
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,680
Hurry up! Otsu-chan's live show is about to start!

229
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
All right, President.

230
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,730
I'm not a President! I'm a sergeant!

231
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:57,170
Through my work as a driver...I realize how great it is to have a destination.

232
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,300
The "Back From the Dead" salon.

233
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,370
I had so many customers. And everyone had a clear vision.

234
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,020
To the hospital.

235
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,780
To Kabukicho.

236
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,740
To Kabukicho.

237
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,300
My life has sure changed... But I no longer have a destination.

238
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,050
Drive until I see the dawn of a new Japan.

239
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,750
You see the skuzzy-looking guy smoking over there? Run him over, but try not to kill him.

240
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,060
What should an old fellow like me do?

241
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,130
I wonder where I should go?

242
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,420
I feel like a child who has no destination.

243
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm... I'm... I'm...!

244
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,670
I don't care where, but take me someplace.

245
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,390
Then I found someone who is a lost child like me.

246
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,390
I have nothing to do. Take me around anywhere for free.

247
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,500
Are you kidding me?! I'm on the job.

248
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,300
It's okay. I just want to see the other side of the horizon.

249
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,590
Who do you think you are...my girlfriend?!

250
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,480
How's your job?

251
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,890
It was fine until you got in.

252
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:01,400
You looked like a dead man when I saw you the other day, but you look better now.

253
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,760
Whatever. Nothing has changed.

254
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,070
I changed my job, but I still don't have a purpose.

255
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,550
I don't have a clear vision for my future.

256
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,880
I guess everyone is in the same boat.

257
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,380
If you keep seeking it, you'll find it eventually.

258
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,800
I don't think so.

259
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,220
Because, in this show, you and I are the only ones with cloudy looking eyes.

260
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,130
Oh, here comes a customer. Get out of my car, jackass!

261
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,320
Why is he here?! What is he doing here?!

262
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,030
Start the car now! I don't want to get in trouble!

263
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,670
Take me to Ueno Zoo. And make it snappy, please.

264
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,550
Oh? Haven't I seen you two somewhere before?

265
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,360
I don't know. Who are you?

266
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,510
You have something nasty on your head.

267
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,850
Earthlings, um, all look like they've been sucking on lemons.

268
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,970
Oh I see. Fair enough.

269
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,790
So, Hasegawa-san, I have to go to abacus class now. Have a nice day!

270
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,850
Wait!

271
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,420
Don't leave me alone! I'm begging you!

272
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,830
Don't leave this old fellow all alone! I'm old! If I get too lonely I'll die!

273
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,330
What are you... a hamster or something?!

274
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,530
Hey, start the car!

275
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,450
Y-Yes. I'm sorry.

276
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,070
Luckily, it appears he doesn't remember me.

277
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,960
Let's take him there quickly and leave before he does remember. Then we'll be safe.

278
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,420
Then release me now.

279
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,960
No, sir, uh-huh! Me scared...and lonely!

280
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,800
Why are you speaking like a foreigner now?!

281
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,000
I can't believe he had his driver's license suspended.

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,200
Why do I, a prince, have to take a dirty taxi?

283
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,310
Hey, silver-haired man! If you have nothing to do, give me some service.

284
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,980
Well... I said service, but why are you washing my hair?

285
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,120
Mr. President, what brought you to Earth?

286
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,030
I'm not a president. What are you talking about?!

287
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,540
You know, I just wanted to see a panda all of a sudden. Ow! Ow!

288
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,960
I've got shampoo in my eyes! You did that on purpose, didn't you?!

289
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,370
I see... You've come to see a panda, Mr. President.

290
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,390
But don't be fooled.

291
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:17,500
It's said that they eat only bamboo, but we never know what they really eat.

292
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,440
They may even eat Shabu-Shabu.

293
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,740
I-I-I-I-Idiot! Are you trying to get yourself killed?! What were you thinking?!

294
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,220
I saw you at my job interview.

295
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,280
Oh, Pops! This is an emergency.
Please give us a ride!

296
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,970
Ugh! I can't breathe! Stop!

297
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,120
Sachiko... my Sachiko has suddenly gone into labor!

298
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,860
My goodness! My charm point has been pulled off!

299
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,320
Oops! Because the car stopped suddenly, it accidentally fell off.

300
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,590
What are you going to do about this?!

301
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,070
Without this, I look like a human. Like an assistant manager!

302
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,660
Don't worry. You look at least manager level.

303
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,350
That's not my point!

304
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,800
You know what? It fell off so easily,
so it must mean you don't need it.

305
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,580
Hey, you two!

306
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,480
There's a woman who's gone into labor!

307
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,440
Gin-san, is there a maternity clinic nearby?

308
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,230
Nope. You'll have to turn back.

309
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,460
Tsk. Then we should go back.

310
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,060
Are you kidding?!

311
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,160
I lose my charm point and now I have to go back? Give me a break!

312
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,180

Can't you direct a tiny fraction of your love for pandas towards human beings?

315
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,970
A human baby-that's real cute, too, you know.

316
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,290
Who cares? Who gets cuddly feelings about uppity, hairless monkeys?!

317
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,060
I really don't care what happens to one or two human babies!

Who are you?! You're just some assistant manager, right?

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,370
Cut it out. What do you think you're doing to the Prince?

321
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,710
I understand, Prince.

You'll be happy if you see a panda, right?

323
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,100
I just remembered there's a panda nearby, actually.

Hey, you hoodlum couple! My cab's suddenly empty. You need a ride?

Pops! I owe you one!

Hey, old man!

333
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,450
I haven't seen you in a while. Why did you come back here?

334
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,890
Because I was fired again.

335
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,150
Why were you fired?

336
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,180
Oh? Because...

337
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,470
I was true to myself.

338
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,510
But I'm not really disappointed.

339
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,420
I may be a hard case, but I am what I am. I've decided to live my life the way I want.

340
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,300
Don't go thinking you're cool just because you call yourself a "Hard Case," you jobless loser!
