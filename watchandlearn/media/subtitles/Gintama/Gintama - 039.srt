Keep the room well-lit and watch from a distance, okay?

00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,710
Just a minute.

7
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,230
Okay, stop.

8
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,840
You're in violation, mister.

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,460
You're supposed to have a lantern when riding at night.

10
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,200
Let me see now...

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,840
Is this bicycle registered for theft prevention?

12
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,580
I'm not sure. I got this from a friend.

13
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,980
I see. Are you on your way home from shopping?

14
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,680
Got any girlie mags? Porno mags?

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,690
Uh, can I go now? I'm kinda busy.

16
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,630
We've had lot of panty burglaries around here recently.

17
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,820
You know?

18
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,340
The masked phantom loincloth burglar broke out of prison again.

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,290
I prefer boxers.

20
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,460
Bye.

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,310
Hang on, buddy, do you have any ID?

22
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,030
Hey, mister!

23
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,170
Commander Okita. That long hair!

24
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,610
Found you at last!

25
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,630
Katsura!

26
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,500
Farewell, Katsura.

27
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,140
Farewell.

28
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,290
It's Katsura, of the Anti-foreigner faction.

29
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,940
He's somewhere nearby!

30
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,310
Find him! We have to catch him!

31
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,130
I'm not letting you get away, Katsura.

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,950
That's...

33
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,420
Katsura, come out peacefully.

34
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,720
We're not letting you get away.

35
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,740
Give it up!

36
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,110
He's injured. He couldn't have gone far!

37
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,850
Hey, doesn't look like he's here. Try the other side.

38
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,330
He's got to be around here! Find him!

39
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,830
This isn't looking good.

40
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,720
They have me surrounded.

41
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,330
Looks like the end of the line for me.

42
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,570
Good evening. I'm Santa Claus.

43
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,860
Good grief.

44
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,580
You were asking for it.

45
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,050
It's your fault for being there when a panty burglar is on the lose.

46
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,040
That bowl makes us even.

47
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,010
I run a ramen shop, so it's the best I can do.

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm the owner here. The name's Ikumatsu.

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,070
I'm Katsura. My favorite food is soba.

50
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,870
[Note: Ramen is egg noodles made with wheat. Soba is made with buckwheat and fillers]

51
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,880
Meaning what? I should give you soba instead?

52
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,700
I see... Just what were you doing on the roof, anyway?

53
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,120
Oh you know. I took a wrong turn.

54
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,650
Oh, so you were walking on the roof because you were lost?

55
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,890
Were you headed to the moon or something?

56
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,890
No, no. That's not it at all. I made a wrong turn...in life.

57
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,690
You are the panty burglar, aren't you?!

58
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,960
Everyone has a skeleton or two in their closet they don't want to talk about.

59
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,200
But let me say this: I'm not a thief.

60
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,400
Look in the mirror. You'll see suspicious long hair.

61
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,800
Are you...

62
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,820
No. I'm just, you know, checking the weather. Seriously...

63
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,030
Tsk, what awful weather.

64
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,240
Ikumatsu-dono, may I stay here until the rain blows over?

65
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
Rain? I don't hear any rain.

66
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,670
I'll tell you the truth...

67
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,560
I'm a ramen hunter. I travel Japan seeking the Way of Ramen.

68
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,080
Your ramen is exquisite. Let me study under you.

69
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,560
Didn't you say you liked soba earlier?

70
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,130
Ramen and soba are similar. They're both long.

71
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,290
You have no right to talk about ramen!

72
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,520
Anyway, there's nothing to gain from working here.

73
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,330
The only kind of customers I get are...

74
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,820
Ikumatsu-chan! Lookin' good!

75
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,360
Don't be cold, baby! Your dear younger brother just dropped by...for a little visit.

76
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,990
Younger brother? That's a joke. After Daigo died, you and I are not related anymore.

77
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,280
Don't be so cold.

78
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,880
And here I came all the way to see how my big bro's widow is doing.

79
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,340
This was originally my brother's shop, you know.

80
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,510
When he died, I was supposed to get it.

81
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,140
But you said you wanted it so bad...

82
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,500
I should get a little paycheck for my generosity, huh?

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,440
Money again?! I don't have any more to give you!

84
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,580
Welcome! May I take your order?

85
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,910
Hey! What do you think you're pulling?

86
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,240
What restaurant did you come from?!

87
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,080
You got no money, but hired a waiter?

88
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm not a waiter, I'm Katsura.

89
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,390
Haven't decided? Then you'll all be having fried rice.

90
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,740
No, we didn't say anything about fried rice.

91
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,940
We didn't come here for a meal.

92
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,240
Beat it! Beat it!

93
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,770
May I recommend our house special? Our B Course?

94
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,310
B Course, Off Course, it doesn't matter. Just be quiet.

95
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:39,430
[Note: Off Course is the name of a Japanese singing group.]

96
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,430
I have something important to discuss with Ikumatsu!

97
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,530
All right then, Ikumatsu-dono. Three fried rice please.

98
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,340
What's with the fried rice?!

99
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,400
The fried rice is the appetizer.

100
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Our B Course comes with an entrée and dessert.

101
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,720
That's a big appetizer!

102
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,270
Just shut up! Ignore him.

103
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,690
Ikumatsu, hurry and hand over the money, baby. Give it up.

104
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,770
The last time I gave you money, I told you that was it.

105
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,780
And besides, I heard you guys...

106
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,340
you claim to be rebels... But  you broke into Mr. Akezato's safe, didn't you?

107
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,250
It costs money to run a rebellion, bitch!

108
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,040
Give it to us and we won't have to steal!

109
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,420
You're no rebels!

110
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,150
You're just a bunch of losers trying to make yourselves look good!!

111
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,260
Even the Shinsengumi gathering outside...

112
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,840
Aren't even bothering with little chumps like you!

113
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,440
Scum like you make me sick!

114
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,070
If it wasn't for trash like you, Daigo might still be...

115
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,000
What, bitch?!

116
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,350
Your main entrée, sir.

117
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,580
Shut up! Beat it!

118
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,710
Fried rice again?! The entrée is fried rice?!

119
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,970
Shrimp fried rice. For dessert, we have cold fried rice.

120
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,530
It's nothing but fried rice!

121
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,640
What is this obsession you have with fried rice?!

122
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,090
What are you some kind of fried rice fetishist?

123
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,700
What the?! All of a sudden, my stomach!

124
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,850
Mine, too.

125
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,800
Dang, this beyond wanting to shit, this is... I gotta get to...

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,260
The...john.

127
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,270
Occupied.

128
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,640
Damn you!

129
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,650
My stomach... I can't hold it...

130
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,600
You put something in the fried rice, didn't you?!

131
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Dammit! We won't forget this!

132
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,860
Oh no! It's coming....

133
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:52,270
[Have you seen someone like this?]

134
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
No one looks like that.

135
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,110
That was well done, you...

136
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,300
What're you talking about?

137
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,780
All I did was provide service, as a waiter should.

138
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,380
Weren't you seeking the Way of Ramen?

139
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,750
Well... Let's say I'm a waiter seeking the Way of Ramen...and leave it at that.

140
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,200
You're an odd fellow. Sticking your nose into a troublesome situation.

141
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,250
Well, never mind.

142
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,980
Whether it's until the rain stops, or until you master the Way of Ramen,

143
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,140
or until your injuries heal...

144
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,510
I'll let you stay here.

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,620
Ikumatsu-dono.

146
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,150
But...

147
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm going to work you hard.

148
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,200
What're you just standing there for?

149
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,330
Weren't you going to study hard and steal my flavor?

150
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,680
No, I think there are many things in this world people are glad they never see.

151
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,770
Like behind the scenes of the male host business,

152
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,600
or a boyfriend's cell phone messages...

153
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,210
What is it you're trying to say?

154
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,550
N-No, nothing really...

155
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,700
All right, listen. Speed is the lifeblood of ramen.

156
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,970
Here ya go.

157
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,930
Say, you're pretty good.

158
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,590
Say, could you...

159
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,880
do a delivery for me?

160
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,710
Ow ow ow ow.

161
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,320
It's raining hard.

162
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,590
It's not raining.

163
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,560
What are you, anyway?

164
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,990
Are you like a kid who doesn't want to go to the dentist?

165
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,010
Ow...

166
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,220
She trusts me too much.

167
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,620
Have you found him yet?

168
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,220
Please relax. We have everything under control.

169
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,290
The Katsura dragnet is closing in on him.

170
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,820
It's only a matter of time before he gives himself away.

171
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,780
I hope you're right.

172
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,950
Katsura has an injured leg. We won't let him escape.

173
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,200
What is it?

174
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,460
Nothing, I just thought it was unusual.

175
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,060
This is the first time I've ever seen you work so hard.

176
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,360
You're the unusual one, Hijikata-san.

177
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,570
No other creature in existence eats his dumplings with that on it.

178
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,630
Really?

179
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,810
Want some? It's delicious.

180
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,340
Absolutely not.

181
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,710
We're up against Katsura. We can't let down our guard.

182
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,900
You don't need to remind me.

183
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,320
Excuse me, sir...

184
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,640
What is that?

185
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,990
What in the hell?!

186
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,200
Don't let your guard down, Vice-chief.

187
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,080
That damn long-hair made a fool of us... He won't get away with this.

188
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,000
But he seemed quite strong.

189
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,350
Yeah, I don't know if we would win even if we ganged up on him.

190
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,260
Relax. Who said we're going to take that kind of risk.

191
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,680
I have an idea.

192
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,110
[Someone please adopt me.]

193
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,560
Mommy, I want that!

194
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,540
Don't look in its eyes.

195
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,900
You'll be possessed!

[Daigo Ramen]

197
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,130
Oh, snacks. How thoughtful of you.

198
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,960
I can be sometimes. It's just a little something for all your hard work.

199
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,510
Well, Good work today.

200
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,990
Huh? What's this?

201
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,810
Can you tell? I spent a little extra.

202
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,210
Yes, it's delicious. Yohei brews great sake. It's great.

203
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,980
Delicious...you say?

204
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,770
I've been thinking about this for a while. Your ramen, Ikumatsu-dono...

205
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,590
Something's missing?

206
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,670
I know something is missing.

207
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,720
Then you'll have to add whatever is missing.

208
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,810
It's not that simple...

209
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,770
...to put in what's missing, that is.

210
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,170
It's a heavy burden...

211
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,930
If you already know that, then I have nothing more to say.

212
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,420
But you know what they say...

213
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,690
Ignorance is bliss.

214
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,160
No, it's not. Because I already know.

215
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,530
You said you weren't going to say anything!

216
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,360
It's like chanting sutras to a horse.

217
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
What's that supposed to mean? You calling me a horse?

218
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,390
Sit three years on a stone.

219
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,560
[Note: Similar to the saying "perserverence will prevail".]

220
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,560
What would that do? Where's the benefit in that?

221
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,760
It seems we're getting farther from the point of this conversation!

222
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,700
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

223
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,810
I know.

224
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,720
I can't leave things the way they are, right?

225
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,170
Ikumatsu-dono.

226
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,190
My husband...

227
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,760
was murdered by rebels.

228
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,160
We made a vow that together, we would become the top ramen shop in Edo,

229
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,510
but he got involved in an incident and that was it.

230
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,300
Saving the country by hurting innocent people is bullshit.

231
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,860
Spinning their noble-sounding words and then destroying whatever they want...

232
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,940
How many of them, I wonder, truly care about their country?

233
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,070
If they can't even save the people right in front of them.

234
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,730
There's no way they can save the country.

235
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,660
Patriots my ass.

236

Samurai my ass.

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,410
I hate them all.

[Please hire me.]

239
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,010
Sorry, I can't. I can't hire someone like you.

[Give me a chance.]

241
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,870
No. This is why I don't want you.

242
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,950
Ikumatsu-dono, two tonkotsu.

243
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,800
[Note: Tonkotsu is a ramen in a soup made with collagen-rich pork bone broth]

245

Say, say, Ikumatsu-chan...

246
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,700
Yes?

247
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,080
Who's the handsome waiter? You go, girl!

248
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,290
You never used to let any men get near you after your husband died...

249
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,130
You devil you!

250
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,990
It's not like that! He's just helping out!

251
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,470
What's so handsome about him, anyway?

252
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,420
Look at that hair! Men look best in crew cuts.

253
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,000
That's what you say, but I'll bet you don't totally dislike him.

254
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,710
No way.

255
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,010
Really?

256
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,320
Hey now.

257
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,970
Ikumatsu-dono. We need to...talk...

258
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,090
Ikumatsu-dono. Where'd she go?

259
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,030
Hey, are you sure it's okay to sell off your sister-in-law?

260
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,280
Hey, she said it herself. She's no relative of mine!

261

[Watch the store. I have to make a delivery.]

262
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,750
She does trust me too much.

263
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,350
I gave her plenty of chances to do right by me, but she wouldn't play.

264
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,160
Time to cash out my investment. Then I'll sell the shop.

265
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,480
I can't stay here.

266
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,950
I can't hurt Ikumatsu-dono. And...she makes me question myself.

267
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,310
I hate them all!

What're you talking about?

272
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,320
These funds are for the rebellion.

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,370
Yeah, right. You'll lose it all gambling!

Why is her delivery bike here...?

All right, just a minute, guys. Hold on a minute!

What's in here? Got any girlie magazines? Porno?

I've brought them...for you!

294
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,610
I have just two things to tell you.

295
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,210
One: Don't ever pose as a rebel fighter again.

296
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,350
Two: Never pass through the curtain of that ramen shop.

297

Violate either, and I promise you payment...from the hand of Kotaro Katsura.

Ikumatsu-dono, thank you for everything. And...

302
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,810
I'm sorry.

303
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,320
I knew the whole time.

304
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:12,910
I'm like you. I don't have what it takes to ignore someone who's in trouble.

305
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm a fool.

306
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,650
So don't apologize.

307
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,040
I see.

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,160
