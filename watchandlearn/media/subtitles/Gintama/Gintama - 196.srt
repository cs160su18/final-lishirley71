2
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,150
Boss!

3
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,350
I apologize!

4
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,540
We didn't realize they were your
friends and mistreated them!

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
Who's the guy with the stony face?

6
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,590
Lord Seimei.

7
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,610
Head of the Ketsuno clan.

8
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,180
A genius onmyoji who's said to
be the strongest in clan history.

9
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,360
[Note: Based off the Onmyoji Seimei Abeno.]

10
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,520
Seimei Ketsuno.

11
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,360
Lady Christel's older brother.

12
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,300
Huh?

13
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,270
["Not Losing to the Wind"]

14
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,970
I apologize for the uncomfortable experience.

15
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,800
Gedomaru, you did well to
protect Christel's friends.

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,330
You have my gratitude.

17
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,700
Please rest to your heart's content.

18
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,690
Christel will yell at me if I allow you to
leave without offering any hospitality.

19
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,870
I can also serve liquor if any of you drink.

20
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,530
He made a feast appear with
a snap of his fingers.

21
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,870
He's a monster!

22
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,400
A Paul Maki monster!

23
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,320
[Note: Japanese Comedian who was popular
with his constant finger snaps.]

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,320
Gin-san, I think I'm going crazy!

25
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,130
We've got fox spirits wrapped around us!

26
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,390
Wrapped around us?

27
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,270
More like they've been
suckling at our nipples.

28
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,140
This may be the work of a devil.

29
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,690
I shall test it for poison first.

30
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,150
Hey, you're drooling.

31
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,780
That's mine!

32
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,780
Uh, Seimei-san...

33
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,570
How did you know we were acquainted
with Ms. Ketsuno?

34
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,630
We of the Ketsuno clan have used
our knowledge of Onmyodo

35
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,500
to defend the Bakufu and
Edo for a long time.

36
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,740
Do you know how we have
carried out that duty?

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
Through our sight.

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,940
Give it to me!

39
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,480
When foretelling disaster or ill omens,

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,550
one must first analyze the target from every
possible angle in order to see anything.

41
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,390
I have stationed shikigami all around
Edo to serve as my eyes.

42
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,050
It is my duty to process the
information they send,

43
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,130
determine what direction this nation is heading,
and how the Bakufu should act.

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,770
How could I not be aware
of my sister's situation?

45
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,810
Heh. I see that Big Bro knows
everything that's going on.

46
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,740
That makes this simple.

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,840
What did you people do to Ms. Ketsuno?

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,210
You believe that we are the reason Christel
can no longer forecast the weather?

49
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,960
Wouldn't the strongest onmyoji ever
be capable of such a thing?

50
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,880
It's true that when Christel left the
Ketsuno clan without a word

51
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,430
and chose to use her power
for the common people,

52
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,420
the traditionalists were
vehemently opposed.

53
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,130
I was also one of them

54
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,850
until I saw her as...

55
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,750
Boss!

56
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,010
Could it be?!

57
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,580
Wait! Seimei-san, where are you going?!

58
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,750
I apologize for being off with
the morning forecast.

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,360
I hope to do better as I give
you the afternoon forecast.

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,110
Christel!

61
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,970
Why?! Why is Christel, morning personality,
reporting a daytime weather forecast?!

62
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,900
Boss! That's because the other weather
lady got sick and took the day off.

63
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,000
Just hurry!

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,610
Hurry up and record this on DVD!

65
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,810
But boss!

66
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,330
The disk is full after recording
Spider-man yesterday!

67
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,410
Erase it!

68
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,400
Erase Spider-man!

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,340
We've already seen it so many times!

70
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,270
No, we can't!

71
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,940
Erase King Kong...

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,910
No, stick to Spider-man!

73
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,440
Just erase the parts where
the heroine shows up!

74
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
The annoying one!

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,010
Here I go then!

76
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,380
Boss! Her forecast is starting!

77
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Hey! You bastards ready to pray?!

78
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,200
Don't miss what she says!

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,300
We'll do whatever it takes to make
Christel's forecast accurate!

80
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,020
Pray the second she speaks!

81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,370
The very instant she speaks!

82
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,300
Yes, sir!

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,320
The afternoon forecast for Edo...

84
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,170
Is sunny.

85
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,120
Make it sunny!

86
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,620
Gin-san, the entire clan is supporting
her, not interfering.

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,480
Seimei-san seems about ready
to literally burn up for his sister.

88
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,240
Shinpachi, it's no use.

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,820
He already joined their family.

90
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,590
Say, why is the person who was
suspecting them joining in?!

91
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,970
How can he blend in so perfectly?!

92
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,520
What is that?!

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,220
So they've also begun!

94
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,790
Don't give in, men!

95
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,890
Break their spell!

96
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,680
The two sides are pushing and prancing
around with each other.

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,290
It is the Shirino clan.

98
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,720
Shirino clan?

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,250
A family of onmyoji that
rivals the Ketsuno.

100
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,420
The Shirino clan.

101
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,710
The Ketsuno clan and Shirino clan

102
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,340
have been in a savage struggle for political
power since the Heian period.

103
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,690
If they hate each other so much, why
do they live next to each other?!

104
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,130
After many years of fighting,

105
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:40,530
they finally joined to serve the Bakufu
together in this Edo period.

106
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,630
Through Lord Seimei's efforts.

107
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,590
However, a new tragedy was born.

108
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,850
The Shirino clan placed one condition
in the peace accord.

109
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,100
To offer Lady Christel as a bride.

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,170
Is that when...

111
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,110
Ms. Ketsuno, known to everyone as the
weather lady, has gotten married.

112
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,720
Lord Seimei accepted the condition,

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,910
believing that it would serve to bring
Lady Christel back to this world.

114
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,250
And Lady Christel also agreed,

115
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,600
believing it would make peace
between the clans.

116
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,720
However, she was unable
to lie to herself.

117
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,770
After getting married,
she grew weaker every day.

118
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,420
Lady Christel spent most of her time
gazing into the sky back then.

119
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,890
Once Lord Seimei saw her,
he realized his mistake,

120
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,420
broke the peace accord,
got Lady Christel divorced,

121
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,230
and returned her to her position
as weather lady.

122
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:57,030
Leaving two clans, allies only in name,
serving the Bakufu side-by-side...

123
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,290
And the hatred was greater than before.

124
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,450
The emotions of the two clans towards
Lady Christel were tangled up,

125
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,100
and their battle grew into something
never seen before.

126
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,690
A mystic battle.

127
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,600
Over the weather.

128
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,360
So the ones who messed

129
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,780
with Ms. Ketsuno's weather forecast
and got her fired are...

130
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,970
Boss! We can't hold on much longer!

131
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,210
Stand strong!

132
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,270
We must make it sunny!

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,070
We can't hold on!

134
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,850
Guys!

135
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,500
Yes...

136
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,860
The misfortune which has befallen Lady
Christel is the work of a single man.

137
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,970
The head of the Shirino clan,
Lady Christel's ex-husband.

138
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,120
The black onmyoji, Doman Shirino.

139
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:27,290
[Based off Doman Ashiya, Seimei's rival.]

140
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,290
That's Ms. Ketsuno's...

141
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,820
Ex-husband...?

142
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,300
Yes, though they were married,

143
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,440
they never opened up to one
another or held hands,

144
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,130
before Lord Seimei
stole his wife away.

145
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,000
Doman...

146
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,770
Seimei, it appears that I win again!

147
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,340
Your sister's weather forecast is wrong.

148
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,810
She should quit before they force her off.

149
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,190
How does she have the nerve to appear on
television with her inaccurate forecasts...

150
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,430
I see that both siblings are thick-skinned.

151
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,670
Doman, damn you...

152
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,580
Circular flyer!

153
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,920
What?!

154
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,840
Seimei, you may strive to
be the greatest onmyoji,

155
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,470
but your abilities are no longer
able to even scratch me.

156
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,150
Oh, a neighborhood matsutake-picking trip.

157
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,770
Should I participate?

158
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,340
I am no longer the person I was before.

159
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,280
I was reborn to extract revenge
against you siblings.

160
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,470
Seimei, you won't be participating?

161
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,510
Then I'm going, up yours.

162
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,790
Bastard...

163
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,840
After challenging and being defeated
by the Shirino clan multiple times,

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,040
you no longer have anyone able to fight.

165
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,690
You are the only one left
to protect your sister.

166
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,670
This rain will never end, Seimei.

167
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,300
Christel may be fired from her
position as weather lady...

168
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,610
The Ketsuno clan may be obliterated...

169
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,140
And this rain will still continue.

170
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:16,130
This rain will continue until the wails
of you siblings have forever ceased.

171
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,930
Pass this to Iwashita-san
next door, will ya?

172
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,170
Seimei-san!

173
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,760
Get a grip, sister lover!

174
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,390
I never imagined that a battle over
the weather was taking place.

175
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,220
An argument between neighbors gets blown
out of proportion when onmyoji are involved.

176
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,840
They were all beaten up.

177
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,010
Gedomaru-san, Ms. Ketsuno doesn't
know about this, does she?

178
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,970
I've been keeping her out of the loop.

179
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,770
Huh?

180
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,990
Why's that?!

181
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,510
Ms. Ketsuno was suffering so much!

182
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,620
If she knew about this fight,

183
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,530
she would return to Doman in
an attempt to end the fight.

184
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,890
Quite frankly, I don't give a damn about
this battle between the clans.

185
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:19,900
I couldn't care less if the Ketsuno clan, which
tamed and used me, were to be crushed.

186
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,830
But...

187
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,450
I never want to see Lady Christel
look so sorrowful again.

188
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,640
You really care about
Ms. Ketsuno, don't you?

189
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:41,400
Lady Christel was the only onmyoji master
who ever treated me as a friend.

190
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,480
And he does not wish for Lady
Christel to learn the truth.

191
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,090
Hello, Ketsuno here.

192
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,010
I apologize for being wrong with
my afternoon forecast, too.

193
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,670
I promise to do better tomorrow.

194
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,660
Shut up!

195
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,210
How many times are you going
to screw up the forecast, girl?

196
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,000
Ah, excuse me.

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,170
Camera's rolling.

198
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,710
Who gives a damn?

199
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,810
Stop giving forecasts that are wrong!

200
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,790
Yeah! Yeah!

201
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,640
Nobody's watching your
forecasts anymore!

202
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,840
Please stop throwing things!

203
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,790
Ms. Ketsuno, run! It's dangerous here!

204
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,700
Then I'll be giving the forecast now.

205
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,390
Wait! What are you doing, Ketsuno?!

206
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,860
It's dangerous!

207
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,140
The hell?

208
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,440
Are you okay, Ms. Ketsuno?!

209
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,460
Aren't you a fan of Christel?

210
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,370
I can't believe you can watch this.

211
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,400
Yeah, I'm a super sadist.

212
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,840
Besides...

213
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,010
Ms. Ketsuno is putting up with
this crap to give her report.

214
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,620
It isn't known when this rain will
end, but by tomorrow morning...

215
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,200
We have a duty to watch.

216
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,150
Isn't that right, big brother?

217
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,470
Who are you calling your big brother?

218
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,280
I am the one responsible
for Christel's suffering

219
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,470
and Doman's turning
down a dark path.

220
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,120
I am not allowed to avert my eyes.

221
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,230
I am obligated to watch every second.

222
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,450
In the past,

223
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,100
I was so focused on protecting the family
as the leader of the Ketsuno clan,

224
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,240
that I allowed duty to blind
me to everything else.

225
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,380
I selfishly used my own sister as a tool

226
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,540
before selfishly taking her
away from Doman.

227
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,960
Pathetic for the greatest onmyoji, who,
supposedly saw all as he defended Edo.

228
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,820
Only after blundering was I able to see.

229
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,340
Only after suffering loss was
I able to understand.

230
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,550
You must watch the things that are
important with your own two eyes.

231
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,300
Dear brother, what's that?

232
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,960
Who are you calling your dear brother?

233
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,040
A letter sent from Doman.

234
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:56,100
Seimei, you should know well that continued
skirmishes will only serve to waste our men.

235
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,650
It is the duty of the head
to defend the family.

236
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,100
And it is the duty of an older brother
to defend a younger sister.

237
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,030
I won't tell you to choose between them.

238
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,010
If you wish to defend both,
face me in a contest.

239
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,150
In a Shikigami Tag Team
Mystic Deathmatch!

240
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,130
This contest shall serve as the
final battle of the weather war!

241
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,410
Shikigami Tag Team
Mystic Deathmatch?

242
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,260
The hell is that, broseph?

243
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,920
Who are you calling your broseph?

244
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,960
It refers to a 3-on-3 onmyodo match.

245
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,820
I see. So this is a challenge.

246
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,180
So he isn't satisfied by
pestering Ms. Ketsuno.

247
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,030
He's come to directly crush bro-bro.

248
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,530
Who are you calling your bro-bro?

249
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,790
Cut that out already!

250
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,110
How desperate are you
to join my family?

251
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,520
No, I don't really mean anything by it.

252
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,650
I just wanted to let you feel as though
you'd suddenly discovered

253
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,150
that you were about to live with
twelve adorable little brothers.

254
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,450
That's one creepy-as-hell
Brother Princess!

255
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,790
Oh, so you do know Sister Princess.

256
00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:00,920
[Note: Sister Princess is a popular beautiful girls
novel, manga, anime and game franchise.]

257
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,870
So you do have a thing
for little sisters, ro-ro.

258
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,920
What the hell is ro-ro?

259
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,740
What does that have
to do with anything?

260
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,610
In any case, I believe this challenge
to be an opportunity.

261
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,460
If I win, I can save Princess Christel.

262
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,860
That would be like walking
right into a trap, nutbro.

263
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,210
The hell is a nutbro?

264
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,660
That makes it sound like I'm a nutxxxx!

265
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,530
I will accept the challenge alone.

266
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,920
The responsibility is all mine.

267
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:32,500
Are you protecting Ms. Ketsuno
because you feel guilty?

268
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,850
Guilt...?

269
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,180
No, I may have been jealous.

270
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,620
Here I was, using my power for the
Bakufu, to protect our traditions,

271
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,920
while she was using her power
to give people the weather.

272
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:56,660
As I watched her smile on rainy days and
windy days, I couldn't help but think...

273
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,800
That she was doing a magnificent job
of protecting the people of Edo,

274
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,500
of bringing them happiness...

275
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,130
She was a much greater onmyoji
than I could ever be...

276
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,220
She is...

277
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,590
My... Our clan's...

278
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,660
Pride and joy...

279
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,100
I wonder if the rain will stop.

280
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,090
Beats me.

281
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,880
Sadly, I don't know how
to read the heavens.

282
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,810
But there's one thing I can say.

283
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,860
Lord Seimei will die.

284
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,740
Doman has become exponentially
stronger than before.

285
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,040
The mark on his face...

286
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,280
He must have dabbled in forbidden
arts so he could defeat Lord Seimei.

287
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,760
On the other hand, Lord Seimei has dispatched
countless shikigami to watch over Edo

288
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,270
and his power is dispersed.

289
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,630
He might have a chance if he
were to focus his power,

290
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,160
but his duty will not allow that to happen.

291
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,080
He won't be able to defeat
Doman as things stand.

292
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,230
Will that change if we go?

293
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,430
Master Gintoki.

294
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,900
I didn't want to say this,
but you should butt out.

295
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,210
Do you know why Lady
Christel sent me?

296
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,280
To stop you.

297
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,140
I was ordered to keep you out of danger

298
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,470
and prioritize your lives.

299
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,540
That can't be!

300
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,210
Are you telling us to stand by
and let Seimei-san die?!

301
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,860
We're the only ones left who can fight!

302
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,100
Don't you realize who will grieve the
most if sister lover dies, bob cut?!

303
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,560
You're okay with Ms. Ketsuno crying?!

304
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,510
You never had any intention of
letting me order you around.

305
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,180
Oh well.

306
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,270
I'm not used to having people
serve me anyway.

307
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,700
Now I'm free.

308
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,160
Don't you understand that a bunch of
amateurs who can't use shikigami

309
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,150
would be reduced to a rain of blood?

310
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,120
Fine by me.

311
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,680
Look at this weather.

312
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,420
Not much difference if it's
blood instead of water.

313
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,060
Spring showers, fall showers,
rain of blood...

314
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,110
I'm willing to stand in any of those.

315
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,220
But...

316
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,410
I'm done standing in a girl's tears.

317
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,740
As I said...

318
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,000
A shikigami is always judging its master.

319
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,790
I've been waiting for those words.

320
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,300
Master Gintoki, I accept you.

321
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,050
You are my second master.

322
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,300
From now on, I will carry out
your every command,

323
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,890
no matter how difficult it may be.

324
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,560
I shall protect you from bullets
and the elements.

325
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,130
So Master Gintoki...

326
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,270
Please assist me in helping
Lady Christel.

327
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,080
You didn't need to ask.

328
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,090
But in return, skip the
master-servant crap.

329
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,620
Too much of a pain.

330
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,660
And don't call me Master Gintoki.

331
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,830
Call me President.

332
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,600
Pachi-boy, let's get going!

333
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,900
Wait!

334
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,130
We can't summon shikigami or anything!

335
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,660
Are we really going to be okay?

336
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,230
Don't sweat the small stuff!

337
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,670
Small stuff?!

338
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,380
Isn't this a shikigami tag match?!

339
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,670
You don't need to worry!

340
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,010
We don't have any shikigami,
but we still have familiar spirits!

341
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,610
Huh?! Where?!

342
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,520
Huh?

343
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,020
So you've come, Seimei...

344
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,760
I praise you for coming alone.

345
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,400
I can handle you myself.

346
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,870
Simple as that.

347
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,420
Hah, you never shut up.

348
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,960
Doman, if I win, you will stop
interfering with Christel...

349
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,440
Unlike you, the Shirino clan
keeps its promises.

350
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:26,130
Seimei, the weather war was all but over.

351
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,640
Yet do you know why I would bother
challenging you to a contest?!

352
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,420
To show you my strength!

353
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,040
I will destroy your pride

354
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,750
so you can die in despair!

355
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,060
Seimei, ever since that day,

356
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,080
I have lived solely for the sake of
revenge against you siblings!

357
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,580
Focused only on the moment when
I would tear the two of you apart,

358
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,570
as I sharpened my claws
in the darkness!

359
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,370
And that time has finally come!

360
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,980
The long weather war will finally end!

361
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,850
Who are you?!

362
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,160
Hey! Walk faster, shikigami!

363
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,420
How did this happen?

364
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,130
Ah! Sorry about being late!

365
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,810
Is this where the world martial
arts tournament is being held?!

366
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,910

Pandemonium-san...

370
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,940
Pandemonium-san!

371
