00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,950
There are these things known
as death flags in our world.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,500
A spoken line or situation
which foreshadows death.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,110
"Could you feed the goldfish for me?"

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,450
would apply.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,480
Once the flag is set,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,290
the man will soon challenge the bad
guys to a final battle and lose his life.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,370
The woman will feed his goldfish in tears.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,110
This example is easy to understand,
but there are other situations.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,070
A bad guy who becomes a good
guy is also at high risk.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,590
A man who regrets everything wrong he's done
and vows to live an honest life from now on.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,780
On his way home from work, he stops
at a cake store of all places.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,470
"Oops, I forgot to ask them to
top it off with mayonnaise."

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,430
That's when death is really near by.

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,090
Captain of the Shinsengumi First Division...
Sogo Okita.

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,860
I have avenged my father's death.

17
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,510
He cannot bring himself
to ask who that was...

18
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,230
For the man has hurt too many
people in his lifetime.

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,120
He may try to change, but those
sins will never go away.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,620
It was selfish to seek happiness for himself.

21
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,600
The man had a mocking smile on his face
as he quietly toppled towards the ground.

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,490
And then...

23
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:57,370
The man locked his legs around the girl's
neck and smashed her into the ground.

24
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,970
As luck may have it,
the man didn't die.

25
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,750
Hey, how are you gonna
make up for this?

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,760
The cake's a mess now.

27
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,900
And I just loaded it up with tabasco
sauce for those morons to chow on.

28
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,900
That's because...

29
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,670
I was a good guy to begin with.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,960
["Beware of Foreshadows"]

31
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,530
There you have it.

32
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,710
Could you sell her off to some illegal
red light district institution?

33
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,400
She's just a kid, but some
freaks pay a lot for that.

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,900
Don't make it sound like
I'm a slave trader.

35
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,980
Huh? Aren't you a slave trader?

36
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,480
You've got this little girl, an illegal immigrant,
working for you without pay.

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,810
Who are you calling a slave?!

38
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,360
Want me to kill you, brat?!

39
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,070
Don't bring trouble to me.

40
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,990
You guys can deal with this little girl.

41
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,590
Such a pain...

42
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,720
There would be no end if we dealt
with every two-bit criminal around.

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,370
We're busy, unlike you people.

44
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,400
Pretty big-headed for a
bunch of murderers.

45
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,600
You go off killing innocent people
along with terrorists.

46
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,030
No wonder you would be so busy.

47
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,490
Kirie-san, was it?

48
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,770
Did your father belong to an
Anti-Foreigner Faction?

49
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,540
Are you implying that I'm mistaken?

50
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,720
My father was an innocent,
ordinary citizen.

51
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,090
This man and his colleagues work to protect
ordinary citizens from terrorists.

52
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,670
They wouldn't-

53
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,520
He was caught up in a fight.

54
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,600
The Anti-Foreigner Faction and the Shinsengumi
were engaged in a chaotic brawl...

55
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,200
My father was caught in the melee
and cut down by this man.

56
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,210
So she says, Okita-kun.

57
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,020
I don't know anything about that.

58
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,970
Don't play dumb!

59
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,030
Don't tell me that you've forgotten
my father, Muneharu Rokkaku!

60
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,690
I can't put up with this.

61
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,550
If I tried to remember the face of
every person I've ever cut down,

62
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,160
I wouldn't be here now.

63
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,970
If I let myself worry about that,
I'd be the one cut down.

64
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,310
On the battlefield, a moment's hesitation
can cost you your life.

65
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,930
Whoever dispatches the people
before him quickest will survive.

66
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,130
It's more or less impossible

67
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,090
to distinguish between commoners
and terrorists on that field.

68
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,880
So you don't remember anything,

69
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,600
and you don't plan on denying you did it?

70
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,330
All I have to say, whether or not I did it,

71
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,660
is that it was her old man's fault for
dawdling around in that place.

72
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,390
You son of a bitch!

73
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,560
Kirie-san, please calm down!

74
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,740
You did it!

75
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,160
You killed my father!!

76
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,150
I'll kill you!

77
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,640
I swear I'll kill you!!

78
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,060
A pity.

79
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,680
If you weren't a girl,
we'd recruit one with such spirit.

80
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,580
But no more of your revenge games.

81
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,980
The next time you step into my realm,

82
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,870
I'll slaughter you without hesitation.

83
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,230
Well, boss, I'll leave the money here.

84
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,480
And this is a little smashed,
but you can eat it.

85
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,150
Wait! You won't get away!

86
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,570
I'll never let you get away with this!

87
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,190
Kirie-san, calm down!

88
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,920
Let me go!

89
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,160
I'll kill you!

90
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,990
I swear I'll avenge my father!

91
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,450
Kirie-san...

92
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,240
Gin-san, Kagura-chan.

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,810
What do we do?

94
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,610
A mere girl trying to avenge
her father alone...

95
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,960
Brings tears to my eyes...

96
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,400
Kagura-chan...

97
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,370
I understand.

98
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,900
I'll give you a hand.

99
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,710
Huh? What?

100
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,620
I said I'll help you kill that son of a bitch!

101
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,360
There's no doubt about it!

102
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,900
He's the one who did it!

103
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,090
Water!

104
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,580
Shinpachi! Water!

105
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,680
I'll kill him!

106
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,100
Wait!

107
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,450
Wait, Kagura-chan!

108
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,550
I swear I'll kill that son of a bitch!

109
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,870
Kagura-chan!

110
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,510
[Kabuki Land]

111
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,330
The Rokkaku incident.

112
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,000
A melee between the
Anti-Foreigner Faction radicals named the Sokai Faction

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,820
and the Shinsengumi which happened
at Rokkaku Inn two years ago.

114
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,840
The Sokai Factions's plan
to simultaneously set fires

115
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,040
all around Edo as a distraction for
the assassination of the Shogun.

116
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,880
["I have a part!"]

117
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,540
The Shinsengumi learned of
the plan at the last second

118
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,600
and assaulted Rokkaku Inn
where they were hiding.

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,130
It resulted in thirty-six catastrophic deaths
between the Shinsengumi and Sokai Factions.

120
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,470
Thirty-six?!

121
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,450
The Sokai Factions were
eradicated in this incident,

122
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,410
while the Shinsengumi only
suffered three deaths.

123
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:29,080
Despite the fact that they only had time to
send f-f-f-five members from the First Division.

124
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,950
You could say that Sogo Okita,
Captain of the First Division,

125
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,200
carried out most of the killing at Rokkaku.

126
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,010
He destroyed an entire Anti-Foreigner
Faction unit by himself?

127
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,650
Scary kid.

128
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,490
But even if he is the strongest
of the Shinsengumi,

129
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,900
he couldn't have made it through
the ordeal unscathed.

130
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:57,980
Kabuki Doggy! Kabuki Doggy!

131
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,720
With those extreme circumstances,
the extreme tension,

132
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,680
I wouldn't be surprised if he accidentally cut
down the owner of Rokkaku Inn, Muneharu.

133
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,390
It's Katsura, not Kabuki Doggy!

134
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,780
Katsura-san...

135
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,900
You agree with Kagura-chan
that Okita-san did it?

136
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,880
No idea.

137
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,270
I'm merely saying that it's possible.

138
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,730
Zura, what happened to the
Rokkaku Inn afterwards?

139
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,850
For a while, Muneharu's wife
and daughter kept it going,

140
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,310
but nobody wanted to stay at
the inn after such an incident.

141
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,710
It went out of business a year ago.

142
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,130
His wife passed away soon after,
perhaps from the exhaustion.

143
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,670
As you can see, I have nothing left.

144
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,500
Father...

145
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,610
Sincerity?

146
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,170
Yes, sincerity.

147
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,630
The most important thing
for an innkeeper.

148
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,590
Always remember to serve customers
with a sincere heart and devotion.

149
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,290
But I have something more important.

150
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,400
Mother and you.

151
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,390
For the two of you, I would do anything...

152
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,190
Father was always so kind.

153
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,790
He cared deeply for Mother and me.

154
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,000
But Father and Mother are gone now.

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,130
I have no home to return to.

156
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,530
He took everything from me.

157
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,810
And yet...!

158
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,200
How can he say he doesn't
remember anything?!

159
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,110
I will never forgive that man!

160
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,850
Gin-san, I can understand why
Kirie-san wants revenge.

161
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,830
But I can't blame Okita-san either.

162
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,740
That was just an unfortunate accident.

163
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,870
An unfortunate accident that happened
as he was trying to protect Edo.

164
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,850
It's not that Okita-san
doesn't remember...

165
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,940
Maybe he just wants to forget?

166
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,550
There's no point in digging up
the past now for revenge.

167
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,320
Kirie-san will end up suffering more.

168
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,790
We have to stop her.

169
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,470
You don't need to worry.

170
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,670
Kagura's with her.

171
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,280
That's why I'm worried!

172
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
It's fine.

173
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
The guy knows.

174
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,120
I can tell after all our run-ins.

175
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,120
Don't you find it odd?

176
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,470
He's the kind of guy
who doesn't hesitate

177
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,510
to cut down women and children
if they're after his life.

178
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,600
Yet he didn't even try to catch her,
much less kill her,

179
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,110
and left her with us
along with money.

180
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,530
He remembers.

181
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,550
He doesn't want to forget.

182
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,080
He probably just...

[Rokkaku Incident]

184
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,000
Greetings, Captain Okita!

185
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,000
Studying in the reference room
after returning from patrol.

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,050
I would expect no less from the captain!

187
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,460
Skilled in both literary and military arts!

188
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,650
The ideal samurai!

189
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,510
I will follow you forever!

190
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,590
No need.

191
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,530
You're annoying, so make
a U-turn and leave.

192
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,830
And you never need to come back.

193
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,920
Is that the case file regarding
the Rokkaku incident?

194
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,490
That was a while ago.

195
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,610
I'm surprised.

196
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,270
I believed the captain to be someone
who doesn't dwell on the past.

197
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,350
Sometimes, it's necessary to look back at
the past in order to move on to the future.

198
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,540
Keep that in mind.

199
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,570
Yes, sir!

200
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,490
I'll write it down!

201
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,320
If you understand, make a U-turn
and look back at the past.

202
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,390
And you never need to come
back from the past.

203
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,100
Yes, sir!

204
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,050
I'll write it down!

205
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,020
I'm telling you to leave, not take notes.

206
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,000
But the Rokkaku incident
brings back memories.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,180
Hey, you listening?

208
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,350
In fact, I must admit that was
when you captured my heart.

209
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,660
Don't admit that.

210
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,300
Go get spirited away.

211
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,950
Please, God.

212
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,550
That was a violent bunch of
Anti-Foreigner Faction men.

213
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,950
One by one, our comrades
were cut down.

214
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,200
Only the captain and I were left.

215
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
Each watching the other's
back, guarding it.

216
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,710
After surviving that furious battle,

217
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:05,230
I was able to recognize that my
fate was tied to the captain's!

218
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,180
You didn't do a thing.

219
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,230
I'd rather let a locker watch my back than you.

220
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,660
But why are you researching
the Rokkaku incident now?

221
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,150
I was stabbed by that thing.

222
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,720
Huh?

223
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,580
The daughter from Rokkaku Inn said
she was avenging her father.

224
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,800
Stabbed?!

225
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,900
Are you okay?!

226
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,180
Where were you stabbed?!

227
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,880
The ass?!

228
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,810
Anal?!

229
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,890
The anus?!

230
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,900
Or was it the asshole?!

231
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,670
Those are all the same thing.

232
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,380
Now look here.

233
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,560
Cut it out or I'll really stab you.

234
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,810
Please stab me!

235
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,450
My dream is to die at
your hands, sir!

236
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,650
We told the survivors
of Rokkaku Inn

237
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,330
that Muneharu died at the hands
of the Anti-Foreigner Faction.

238
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,140
So why now...?

239
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,480
It wasn't Captain Okita's fault
that Muneharu Rokkaku died!

240
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,540
That was...

241
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,560
Forget it.

242
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,500
That isn't the problem here.

243
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,320
Forget it?

244
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,040
Don't tell me that you allowed
the girl to walk free?!

245
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,380
I'm saying that a girl or two won't
be able to give me any trouble.

246
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,780
But, Captain...!

247
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,540
Are you upset about letting
her father die...?

248
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,650
In that case...!

249
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,410
That isn't it.

250
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,560
Then why?!

251
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,310
I can't bear this!

252
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,180
I shall prove your innocence!

253
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,910
I'm not innocent.

254
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,080
You should be well aware of that.

255
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,320
You didn't do anything wrong!

256
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,250
I shall go tell her the truth!

257
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,820
I can't hold it in any longer!

258
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,290
Didn't you hear me tell you to forget it?

259
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,430
We were the only survivors.

260
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,020
If we keep quiet, there won't
be any further trouble.

261
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,900
But as things stand, you'll
be called a murderer...!

262
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,080
I'll become a murderer
if that's what it takes,

263
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,480
if you don't stop that loose
tongue of yours.

264
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,380
The real question is...

265
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,290
Yes, how did the girl find
out and come after me?

266
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,730
Someone is trying to kill me through
that girl by using that incident.

267
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,660
That's why you're reading the case file?

268
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,540
Look at that short sword.

269
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,880
A good blade that's been well-used.

270
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,590
But why would the daughter
of an ordinary citizen

271
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,030
be carrying such a thing when
swords have been banned.

272
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,740
There are still people who
need to be silenced.

273
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:39,520
We might not have been the
only survivors at Rokkaku.

274
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,340
Kamiyama, go see what
you can sniff out.

275
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,610
And wipe that bloody ass, too.

276
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,720
Y-Yes, sir!

277
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,310
Sogo is sneaking around?

278
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,880
Yes, he's behaving suspiciously.

279
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,350
Talking about being stabbed
by someone.

280
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,960
"Stab me."

281
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,580
"Go wipe your ass."

282
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,240
He was whispering about something
with Kamiyama.

Yamazaki...

284
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,390
Even if you're keeping an eye on him,

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,390
private information like, uh,
sexual preferences...

286
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:21,260
should stay off-limits, I would say.

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,680
This information doesn't leave the room.

290
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,250
Vice-chief, you're mistaken.

291
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,740
It seems that someone's
after Captain Okita's life.

Do you remember the Rokkaku incident?

Wasn't that business
dealt with long ago?

Yes...

295
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,630
But, Captain Okita was
reading this case file.

296
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,320
I believe there's a connection.

297
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,350
Those two were the only survivors
from the incident.

298
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,700
And there were oddities in the report.

299
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,120
The two of them might
be hiding something.

You're not that girl, are you?

So you were the one

320
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,300
I don't have time to deal
with someone like you.

321
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,360
So you do have manners.

322
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:24,180
[Note: From "Happy Turn", a Japanese rice cracker.]

323
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,190
All right, I'll reward you with a Happy Term.

324
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,580
A Happy Term that's all swollen

325
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,180
after the salt was licked off
and became an Unhappy Term.

326
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,950
I want to kill you.

327
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,630
God, I don't care if I die.

328
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,450
So please kill this damn bitch in return.

329
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,580
So? Where's the kid?

330
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,710
You probably came to kill me together.

331
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,750
Killing you will only make
Kirie's hands dirty.

332
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,750
Then why are you here?

333
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,730
Are you going to be my bodyguard?

334
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,990
Tell me the truth.

335
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,030
It's obvious that you're hiding something.

336
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,690
I know that you're too skilled to
mistake an ally for an enemy.

337
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,090
What are you trying to hide by
pretending to be a murderer?

338
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,760
Tell Kirie to her face.

339
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,060
If you refuse, I'll punch a hole
in your face for Kirie.

340
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,910
I am too good to mistake
an ally for an enemy...

341
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,980
That's true.

342
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,690
But...

343
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,690
What if someone you thought
to be an ally was an enemy?

344
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,370
Some things in this world aren't
meant to be known, little girl.

345
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,090
Besides, you shouldn't go off talking
out of character like that.

346
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,600
See? You've triggered my death flag.

347
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,810
Kirie?!

348
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,380
Who is it?

349
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,430
Don't raise your voice,

350
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,660
or the secret investigation you're hiding
from your comrades will be for nothing.

351
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,910
Rokkaku survivor, Kamiyama-san.

352
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,580
Wh-Who are you?

353
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,000
Could you answer a few
questions for me?

354
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,370
What's that bastard hiding?

355
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,420
What did you do during
the Rokkaku incident?

356
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,630
All these people gathered on
such a nice day for revenge?

357
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,490
You've got spirit.

358
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,870
Like you're ready to raid Kira's mansion.

359
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,870
[Note: A reference to the Japanese fiction tale "Chusingura".]

360
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,720
They must have loved your old man.

361
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,340
Or they must really hate me.

362
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,630
Kirie!

363
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,080
Don't move.

364
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,650
If you don't want to take the daughter's
life after taking the father's.

365
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,600
Right, Mr. Sogo Okita the murderer?

366
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,930
Kamiyama, listen to me.

367
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,360
Forget everything you just saw.

368
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,480
Rokkaku was already dead
when we found him here.

369
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,710
He was caught up in the battle and
killed by the Anti-Foreigner Faction.

370
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,040
After concealing evidence
and changing the facts,

371
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,870
it was foolish of you to allow
a survivor to escape.

372
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,990
The Sokai Factions weren't wiped out.

373
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,260
It was revived to get revenge...

374
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,440
No, to crush you all.

375
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,070
I've gotten caught up in your trouble.

376
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,850
How you gonna make up for this?

377
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,970
Serves you right.

378
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,250
That's what you get, damn girl.

379
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,950
[To Be Continued]

[Preview]

381
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,950
C-Captain!

382
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,380
I won't be able to bear
watching you tied up,

383
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,270
abused, stabbed, and
suffering next week!

384
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,130
I can't sit idly by anymore!

385
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,360
Please shut up.

386
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,260
Yes, sir!

387
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,040
The next episode...

388
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,740
"It's Goodbye Once a Flag is Set."

389

by the Sokai Factions survivor, Sotatsu.]
