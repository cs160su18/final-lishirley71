He's here! A hunter is here!

8
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,730
He's here! He's really here!

9
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,810
He seems incredibly strong! He's without
a doubt, a first-rate hunter.

10
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,790
We've got to recruit him!

11
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,890
Thank you. You saved us. You're
very strong. Do you hunt alone?

12
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,750
I have no friends (lol). Won't
you join me in the hunt (lol)?

13
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,380
He wants to join us! He looks scary,
but he seems to be nice enough.

14
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,530
Yes, by all means!

15
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,380
We're novices and don't have
a clue. I'm Patsuan. (lol)

19
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,280
I'm on a quest for revenge. It's
going to be a hellish journey.

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,640
(It probably can't be anything good seeing
as you're playing games in the afternoon.)

Hey! You're being way too
honest in the parentheses!

35

You're writing feelings
you shouldn't write!

did you get that scar?!

What are you in real life,
Fruit Punch Samurai G?

46

I'm totally on to you, but
I'll ask as a courtesy.

47
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,130

48

a screwdriver. (+)

You, too?!

I was subjected to alien abduction
by a mysterious UFO.

52
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,610
My body was modified
without my consent.

53

I'm playing this game to pursue the alien
gamers. Do you know anything?

54
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,260
Huh?

55
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,330
Just a minute... (sad)

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,340
He's a nuisance. Let's kick him out
and find someone else.

57
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,930
Gosh. There were other
victims besides us.

58

Just a minute. Let's hunt together...

59
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,090
Hey, I thought I told you not to
show your face around here.

60
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,850
If you're going to come here, I told
you to change your name first,

You're still in this game?

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,830
How many times have I told you to change
your confusing name? (anger)

66
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,830
[Note: "Punch" is "ponchi" in Japanese. "Ponchi" spelled
backwards is "Chinpo" which means "penis."]

67
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,140
You're the one who has
to change his name.

68
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,660
I will not allow anyone to
use the name "Fruit."

You missed! Where are you aiming,

I'm a screwdriver.

79
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,010
What...?! Chinpo Samurai G...not
you, too...?! (surprise)

[Note: Reference from the movie "The Fly".]

84
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,210
and had their body fused with a screwdriver
at the genetic level?!

85
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,010
That's totally different! Only you were
involved in "The Fly" accident!

86
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,110
That's shocking... (I have no
idea what he's talking about.)

87
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,270
He's going with the flow!

88
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,680
At any rate, we're both fighting
the wrong enemy.

89
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,160
Totally wrong! This is a
totally different incident!

90
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,800
Did it happen to you people, too?

91
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:09,350
Well, yeah. Anyway, let's capture the alien
gamers-they're in here somewhere.

92
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,220
They can help him.

93
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,900
No, they can't! Not him! What
an irresponsible thing to say!

94
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,590
Don't slow us down.

never ignores people in need.

my second personality awakens and
I become a hard-nosed berserker.

98

You were a hard-nosed
berserker from the start!

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,540
You say you're going to find
the alien gamers...but how?

100
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,360
This game is filled with gamers
from all over the galaxy.

101
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,520
Besides, their appearance will be totally different
from how they appear in real life.

102
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,710
How will you find and recognize them?

103
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,280
We need to find M. (passion)

104
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,080
M...? That's impossible!
He's just a myth!

105
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,060
Even if he is, we have no other
way out of this difficult situation.

106
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,940
We have to find M. (passion)

107
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,190
But...

108
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,050
Just a minute. Just what is M?

109
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,130
You don't know? (ass)

110
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,510
(Ass)?! Are you saying I'm stupid?
You better not mean that!

111
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,270
Codename M.

112
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,180
He has existed since Genesis.

113
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,870
He is all-knowing and has hunted
throughout this entire world.

114
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,380
The legendary hunter...M.

115
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,770
If he's all-knowing, he must know
where the alien gamers are.

116
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,420
There's no guarantee, but I've heard
rumors that someone resembling M

117
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,200
was last seen in Area D-51.

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,060
Area D-51? That's the lair of mythical beasts
that even top-class hunters fear.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,490
So this is Area D-51...gives
me the creeps.

120
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,100
Be wary. The monkeys that live
here are of the highest level.

121
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,160
If you encounter one, don't fight
it under any circumstances.

122
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,960
We'd be no match for it. (fear)

123
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,670
I can't believe anyone would be in
such a frightening place like this.

124
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,790
Exactly. Only monsters dwell here.

125
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,560
So if you see a human-like shadow,
you can assume it is M. (resolve)

126
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,670
Did you hear something?

127
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,050
A howl...like that of some kind of beast.

128
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,040
Could it be the enemy?!

129
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,420
No, it sounds different!

130
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,810
Look! A human-like form!

131
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,690
No, it can't be! Could this
be M? Is this really M?

132
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,040
Th-That's...!

133
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,430
Oh no! Someone's been strung up
to roast! Hurry and get her down!

134
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,700
She's still breathing.

135
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,510
She must've been captured by the monkeys
and was about to be eaten.

136
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,700
Hey, pull yourself together! Can you
speak? What happened?! What...

137
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,950
Why'd you cut me down?

138
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,620
It's you! This is just

139
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,090
an ordinary M!

140
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,090
[Note: M stands for masochist.]

141
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,810
Some "legendary hunter"!

142
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,020
What did you bring us here for?! Huh?!

143
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,680
Let's string this guy up next.

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,140
Stop it! If you're going to do
that, do it to me. Please!

145
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,900
You keep quiet, perverted woman!

146
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,390
What? If you've got a problem with that,
let's hear it! C'mon, say it! Say it!

147
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,870
M-Monster!

148
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,610
I-Impossible!

149
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,700
He defeated the mythical beast, Paoshanron,
a monkey of the strongest class...

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,020
Yo.

154
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,490
I'm M.

[GinTama Monkey Hunter Arc]

156
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,000
There's no doubt about it.

157
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,210
Only one person in this world
could do such a thing.

158
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,720
One who is all-knowing; one who has
hunted all over the entire game...

159
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,790
This is the legendary hunter...M!

160
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,790
C-Cool!

161
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,360
I was expecting a much older, rugged
sort of guy, but he's way cooler!

162
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,430
Did you appear in FF? He
appeared in FF, didn't he?

163
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,430
[Note: Refers to Cloud from Final Fantasy VII.]

164
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,960
I want your autograph.

165
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,180
What're you getting so excited about?

166
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,900
That's not the reason we came here.

167
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,300
Excuse me, M-dono, would you mind
taking a photo with my kid and me?

168
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,350
What did you come for?! Who's your kid?

169
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,320
Forgive us. We're...

170
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,940
You don't have to say anything.

171
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,470
Who do you think I am?
I am the all-knowing M.

172
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,250
I know why you're playing this game
and why you came in search of me.

173
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,570
I know everything.

174
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
I've been waiting for you.

175
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,100
People who can face any crisis, who
hunt for the hope that is tomorrow...

176
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,890
I have been waiting for true
hunters like you to come.

177
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,950
Recently, there has been an increase in

178
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,300
some rather odd hunters coming
to the Mon-Hun world.

179
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,090
They're not here to enjoy hunting.

180
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:30,940
All they do is search for people.
And they all say the same thing...

181
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,860
Do you know anything about
the alien gamers?

182
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,240
I-It can't be...

183
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,890
Yes. You're not the only victims
of alien abduction.

184
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,210
Others like you, who wish
to restore their bodies,

185
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,840
are coming one after another
into this world.

186
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,840
Didn't you people know?

187
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,140
It's become such a crisis that the
Bakufu is taking action.

188
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,850
I was asked by certain higher-ups
in the Bakufu

189
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,840
to infiltrate this game. I'm here to string
up and arrest the alien gamers.

190
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,910
No, you strung up yourself,
indulging in M play.

191
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,280
But the majority of players gave
up and tossed their controllers.

192
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,680
It is nearly impossible to
find specific individuals,

193
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,220
whose names you don't even know,
in the huge world, known as the Net.

194
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,180
You are the first ones
to have reached me.

195
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,940
You'll find what you're looking for here.

196
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,170
Inside this temple is the monkey
who stands above all others,

197
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,240
the mythical beast...

198
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,210
Seiten Taisei. The aliens
plan to hunt it down.

199
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,210
[Note: Seiten Taisei is the self-claimed name
of Son Goku in Journey To The West.]

200
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,260
They will come here for sure.

201
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,700
You are people whom I recognize
as true hunters.

202
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,340
Will you fight with me?

203
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,880
I cannot stand by and watch anymore
as people trample on

204
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,340
this hunters' paradise
with their soiled feet.

205
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,200
Let us go together. Let us reclaim
our hunters' paradise.

206
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,940
Oh M...!!

207
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,390
Keep it down!

208
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,370
Oops, sorry.

209
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,740
M is way cool! Finally,
we got someone decent to be...

210
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,990
a member of our party!

211
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,130
Are you okay with getting involved
in such a problem?

212
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,140
Hmph.

213
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,710
Games are all about the enjoyment
of solving problems.

214
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,730
Don't worry. I'm not doing this on
a whim or just for the fun of it.

215
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,110
I have to restore my own body, as well.

216
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,930
Not you, too?!

217
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,910
Well, yeah. Though I'm not in
as bad shape as you people.

218
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,860
A light shined down on me from the sky

219
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,300
and by the time I knew what was
happening, it was too late.

220
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,360
I had been rendered completely
unemployed.

221
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,360
That's not a modification!

222
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,940
Why are you blaming aliens
for not having a job?!

223
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,280
You were that way before
they showed up!

224
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,330
I was turned into a spiritless, filthy dude
with sunglasses named Hasegawa.

225
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,210
That's who you are!

226
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,750
You're just trying to escape your real life
self by pretending to be someone else!

227
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,690
No way...the legendary hunter...was
Hasegawa-san?

228
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,850
I see.

229
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,410
He has so much free time that
he escaped into this game

230
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,590
and became the strongest hunter here.

231
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,770
His life inside the game and his real
life are in inverse proportion.

232
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,590
Often, the heroes who have
influence inside a game

233
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,420
are good-for-nothings in the real world
who have too much free time.

234
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,890
The legendary hunter is a legendary
good-for-nothing.

235
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,510
In that regard, our party
is the strongest ever.

236
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,350
We're all good-for-nothings.
Will we be okay?

237
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,810
Oh...someone's there...!

238
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,710
There they are!

239
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,950
It's them! No mistake! They look
almost the same as in real life!

240
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,870
Those jerks! I'll finish them off!

241
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,990
Wait!

242
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,530
We're inside the game.

243
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,940
Capturing them in here won't
restore our bodies. (anxiety)

244
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,030
Punch Samurai G is right.

245
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,210
Unless we capture the guys
playing the game,

246
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,670
any victory in here would
be meaningless.

247
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,090
Then...what can we do?

248
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,540
There's the offline meeting.

249
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,040
Offline meeting?

250
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,130
Yes. An offline meeting is a "land party",
where people who met on the Net,

251
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,910
via a bulletin board or chat room,

252
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,610
can meet face-to-face and get
to know each other better.

253
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,300
We'll help them with their hunt
and become Net friends.

254
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,700
Then we'll invite them
to an offline meeting

255
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,840
and drag them out of the cyber world.

256
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,570
We don't have time to go
through all that trouble!

257
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,760
This is already the second week!

258
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,790
We've already spent two weeks
on this ridiculous subject!

259
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,990
It's our second week, so we need
to approach this rationally.

260
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,150
And it's part B, so we need
to calm down and think.

261
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,700
Okay! Then let's hold an offline
meeting to plan our strategy.

262
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,760
You're too calm. That's an "I'm
relaxing at home" calmness!

263
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,990
I-It's here!

264
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,150
Senpai, the final boss appeared.

265
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,280
Oh, it's huge.

266
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,660
Whatever we do, make them
feel indebted to us.

267
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,590
Our enemy is the strongest in Mon-Hun.
Don't get yourselves killed.

268
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,450
Let's go!

269
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,310
I think they killed it.

270
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,050
Just a minute! What're you doing?!
We haven't done anything yet!

271
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,850
Ah...we've killed the final boss.

272
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,260
I guess we're done with Mon-Hun.

273
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,030
Oh no! This isn't good!
We've got trouble!

274
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,470
They're planning to quit the game!
If they leave, it's over for us!

275
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,180
An enemy! We have to give
them a new enemy!

276
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,310
Where are we going to
find another enemy?!

277
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,960
I'll think of something!

278
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,590
Keep them in the game until then.

279
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,160
I think our only choice is
to use womanpower.

280
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,890
Suit yourself.

281
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,950
You never did find it, did you?

282
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,230
You mean the rare item?

283
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,370
No...that.

284
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,190
You go and approach them.

285
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,190
Oh no! Because Ginko, you told
me his antennae was too risqué.

286
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,810
You go, Ginko.

287
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,360
Oh my, they're looking this way.

288
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,960
Uh, excuse me... The two
of us are on a hunt.

289
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,920
She wants to know if you'd
like to come with us.

290
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,970
Oh no, that was her. She said it.

291
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,960
Terrific! They've got the high-school
co-ed thing down pat!

292
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,120
No man can resist that!

293
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,040
I really didn't care, but Ginko here said...

294
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,480
C'mon, stop that! Saruko,

295
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
you were saying those body
tights turned you on.

296
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,020
Oh no, that was you, Ginko.

297
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,450
No, you did, Saruko.

298
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,260
No, I said that.

299
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,670
Why's an old man joining in?!

300
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,040
Don't you think it's seriously risqué?

301
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,160
Those body tights are so risqué, don't
you think? Aren't they risqué?

302
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,820
You're not a girl right now!

303
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,120
The problem is you, the creepy old man!

304
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,500
Sorry, but we already defeated
the final boss.

305
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,310
Wow! Awesome!

306
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,990
You're so strong, aren't you?!
I so respect that!

307
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,330
Well, I guess. It took only one shot.

308
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,970
But did you know there's a hidden
boss inside that temple?

309
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:11,660
There's a super-strong hidden boss called
Smegmamon or Masta Bayter.

310
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,940
Masta Bayter?! Oh, come on now!

311
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,490
Senpai, what do you think?
They want to come with us.

312
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,640
I don't care.

313
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,470
Just a minute! There's no Masta
Bayter anywhere in this world!

314
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,060
What are we going to do?!

315
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,190
They just lied to convince
them to go with them!

316
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,540
This is bad.

317
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,990
That Senpai dude is totally
stricken with 8th-grade-itis.

318
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,050
He's fully aware of the opposite sex,
but can't deal with them face-to-face.

319
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,990
He acts disinterested.

320
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,450
You see? He's part of the group,
but notice the distance.

321
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,580
The sex-appeal tactic is backfiring.

322
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,770
They won't be able to invite
them to an offline meeting.

323
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,920
Let's use his 8th-grade-itis
to our advantage.

324
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,110
People with 8th-grade-itis have a thick
AT Field towards the opposite sex,

325
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,110
[Note: Absolute Terror Field from
Neon Genesis Evengelion.]

326
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,670
but they're defenseless against
those of the same sex or race.

327
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,710
What's an AT Field? Aren't you
the one with 8th-grade-itis?

328
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,010
I'll force open a hole in his AT Field.

329
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,090
You guys use that opportunity
to get close to him.

330
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,340
How're you going to force it open?

331
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,640
That guy won't let anyone
in except his Kohai.

332
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,280
I'm sure he'll open up if we
show him we're his friends.

333
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,350
Is there anything they identify with?

334
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
That!

335
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,590
Senpai, is something the matter?
You've been really quiet lately.

336
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,770
It's nothing.

337
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,450
This isn't working. He hasn't
opened up to us at all.

338
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,300
He's at a difficult age.

339
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,470
But he keeps ogling us. So irritating!

340
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,770
Don't lose patience. We'll
seduce him in time.

341
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,930
Oh?

342
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,250
Aren't you...

343
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,650
Senpai?

344
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,780
It's me. Me! I was two grades
below you in middle school.

345
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,320
Don't you remember me? This antenna?

346
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,820
Awesome! A new species of monkey!

347
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,980
A rare monkey. Let's
quickly take his stuff.

348
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,400
Did he say something just
now? Do I know him?

349
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,550
He's nobody you know. He's just
a monkey. A genuine monkey.

350
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,540
I obtained a truly rare item.

351
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,590
I want you to have this as
a token of our friendship.

352
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,680
[Obtained: A filthy antenna]

353
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,030
You mean it?

354
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,220
That's great, Senpai. You can use
it to create powerful armaments.

355
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,100
No, I think it probably has no use at all.

356
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,390
No, you can use it in a cursed knife.

357
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,800
Fruit Chinpo Samurai G!! (lol)

358
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,220
What's the (lol) for?

359
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,950
That strategy was a total failure,

360
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,740
but the awkwardness has lessened a bit.

361
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,160
Fruit Chinpo Samurai G! Your death
was not in vain! (roflmao)

362
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,630
Why are you laughing?

363
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,900
Fruit Chinpo Samurai G taught me that

364
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,690
people must bare themselves and confront
each other head-on. (naked)

365
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,370
No, that guy was simply vulgar.

366
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,880
There was no hope of opening
up that guy's heart

367
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,110
by whispering secretly between
ourselves over here.

368
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,100
I've made up my mind-I'm going to bare
myself and confront them. (resolve)

369
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,150
I will tell him everything I
feel with open frankness.

370
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,960
We may live on different planets,

371
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,620
but I am sure we can understand
each other!

372
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,050
Just a minute, Katsura-san!

373
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,130
Hey! You guys!

374
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,590
The truth is, I sometimes urinate
when I take a shower,

375
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,410
but you all do that, too, don't you?

376
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,620
He's revealing something
that's totally irrelevant!

377
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,520
A-Awesome! Rare monkeys
keep appearing here!

378
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,660
No, he's your friend, right? They
were both your friends, right?

379
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,640
No, these monkeys aren't our friends.

380
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,220
They were genuine monkeys.

381
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,930
I obtained a very rare item.

382
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,160

Huh? What're you saying?

389

I'm asking who you people are!
