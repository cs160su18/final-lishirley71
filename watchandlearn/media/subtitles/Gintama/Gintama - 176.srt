Uh, Gin-san?

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,480
What is it, Shinpachi?

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,910
Just to be clear, what was that countdown
you mentioned in the preview last week?

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,950
Was it just the usual...?

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,310
Another fake ending scam?

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,680
Of course not.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,960
We're actually having
a countdown today.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,260
I'm a grown-up. I'm not
going to lie every time.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,160
It's a matter of trust.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,930
You think that people
still trust this show?

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,110
Ouch, Kagura-chan!

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,140
Where did you learn to be so hateful?!

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,430
You can't blame them, Gin-san.

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,040
We said we're entering the "final chapter"
around the same time last year.

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,280
That means we've been in the "final
chapter" for a whole year.

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,380
Plus there was the whole fake last episode
fiasco at the end of our third year.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,570
Oh, that.

19
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,890
Well, they just wanted to try
out some last episode gag.

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,430
It wasn't meant to trick the audience.

21
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,630
We figured that everybody was used
to the show's style by now, but...

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,290
The phones at TV Tokyo were ringing non-stop
right from the start of that episode.

23
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,880
And because I made an ambiguous
statement about Sunrise,

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,410
"Sunrise" became the number
one searched term on the net.

25
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,750
The script actually had me saying
that Sunrise went bankrupt.

26
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,710
Naturally, we got called by the producers'
higher-ups at the time and got yelled at.

27
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,180
"Do you have any idea what it means
to be a publicly traded company?!"

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,410
Even the staff got a call from their families who
were watching the show and were asked,

29
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:29,470
"It looks like GinTama is ending.
Do you have another job lined up?"

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,580
Why would you want to trick your family?

31
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,440
Yeah, yeah. I get it already. We're sorry.

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,890
That's why we're actually having
a countdown today.

33
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,360
No lies, I swear!

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,830
Are you sure?

35
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,770
Is the GinTama anime really
having a countdown?

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,180
Really! Look at my eyes!

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,190
Do I look like I'm lying?

38

Sorry, we've only got a background
shot, so I can't tell.

39

53

You once tried to protect this country
along with Shinsuke and the others.

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,360
You are obsessed and unable to let go.

You are a living ghost!

There is no longer anything
for you to protect!

When did he get ahold of my strings?

63

What're you waiting for? Fire!

Clean out your ears and listen up!

I've never once fought for the
sake of this cheap country.

I couldn't care less...

67
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,140
if this country or samurai
fell. I have always...

Okay!

"Then, and now, what I protect
has never changed!"

This really is just a Count Down TV!!

Yep! Gin-san never lies!

82

Fine, you didn't lie,

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,120
but you still tricked the audience!

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,140
We got caught up in the flow
and yelled "Down!" with you.

85
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,640
Is this the annual recap episode that we do
right before the start of the Fall season?

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,920
Exactly.

87
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,060
Man, we always manage to burn through the
budget for the first two quarters by this time.

88
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,920
So we have to throw in a recap episode.

89
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,740
Will you stop with the graphic
production details?

90
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,950
We had a teensy bit of budget left over,
so we were able to do this CG.

91
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,130
Well, that's only natural after all the
alternate route bonuses we used.

That's right!

a bonus that came with the previous three years.

those images on TV?

really high quality too.

This is what you call a battle of
vengeance. Avenging a killer?

There's nothing to gain. I know that.
