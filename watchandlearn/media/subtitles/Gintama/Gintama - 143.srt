00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,330
Life is just one important decision after another.

3
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:43,000
Go ahead and see how far your naive decisions can take you.

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,720
I told you, didn't I? I...

5
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,300
...hate killing my own kind.

7
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,800
H-He...

8
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,270
saved us...

9
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,060
Shinpachi...

10
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,640
Kagura-chan!

11
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,700
Thank god.

12
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,730
You're back to normal...

13
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,640
I...lost.

14
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,840
To my Yato instincts...

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,100
To my own self...

16
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,890
I tried to kill him.

17
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,750
After all that preaching I did...

18
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,350
In the end, I wasn't any different...

19
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,350
from them...from my brother.

20
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,810
That's not true.

21
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,420
Kagura-chan, weren't you fighting to protect us?

22
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,800
Sorry...

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,590
It's because I was weak that...

24
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,770
If only I were stronger...

25
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,800
I couldn't see anything...

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,430
I couldn't hear anything...

27
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,810
Inside that total darkness, I heard...

28
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,380
Your voice...

29
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,800
Shinpachi, you're the one who protected me.

30
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,240
I feel so frustrated.

31
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,540
I want to become stronger...

32
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,540
Strong enough to protect everyone.

33
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,270
Strong enough so that I won't lose to anyone, not even myself.

34
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,100
I feel the same way.

35
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,790
But, for now!

36
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,420
There are people who need our help.

37
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,520
There are things even we can protect.

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,130
Every time we protected something,

39
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,180
we became a little stronger, didn't we?

40
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,940
So let's wipe our tears and go.

41
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,940
I'm sure we'll become a little stronger.

42
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,560
Don't let them get to Hinowa-sama!

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,190
Hold them back!

44
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,770
So persistent.

45
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,060
It's not my style to kill women.

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,570
Women may give birth to strong children, right?

47
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,840
Well, I suppose I can't expect anything from your children.

48
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,770
S-Stop it!

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,440
What's so fun about killing people like that?!

50
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,210
How can you kill people and just smile like that?!

51
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,660
That's harsh. After all I did to bring you here.

52
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,720
Besides, they're the ones keeping your mother locked up here.

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,960
I don't remember asking for it!

54
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,520
I pay my respects with a smile when killing.

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,680
Regardless of how their life was, it's appropriate to send them off with a smile,

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,860
so they can die soundly.

57
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,840
You could even say that, I intend to kill when I'm smiling.

58
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,310
I'm kidding.

59
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,640
I don't believe in killing children.

60
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,770
After all, they may grow up to be strong.

61
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,160
Come here.

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,520
You should also smile.

63
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,520
You don't want to meet your mother with such a strained look on your face.

64
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,920
Mom is...here...?

65
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,600
Eight years ago,

66
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,580
when she was captured while trying to help you escape,

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,530
she traded her own freedom for yours.

68
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,510
She's only a courtesan in name.

69
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:12,250
Hosen locked her up here when he wasn't using her to attract customers.

70
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,150
She was allowed no clients nor freedom.

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,330
Hosen forced Hinowa to rot to death here.

72
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,020
No, I suppose you could say that Hinowa chose this for herself.

73
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,220
In order to protect you.

74
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,540
Yet you still came here.

75
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:34,740
Wasting Hinowa's years of hardship and resolve and putting yourself in danger...

76
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,810
But you still came to see her.

77
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,930
Which means you're resolved in your own way.

78
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,870
It's your job to go from here on.

79
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,790
Leave.

80
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,070
You won't find what you're seeking here.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,570
Leave.

82
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,600
M-Mom...?

83
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,790
Is that you, mom?!

84
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,850
Open up!

85
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,780
You know who I am, right?!

86
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,540
I'm your son, Seita!

87
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,660
Mo...!

88
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,960
I have no son.

89
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,910
I don't know any dirty brat like you.

90
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,970
Why do you know...?

91
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,090
Why do you know I'm a dirty brat?

92
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,610
You were watching me, weren't you?

93
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,360
Whenever I was looking up at you from below,

94
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,450
you were also looking at me, right?

95
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,370
You never responded when I shouted to you,

96
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,810
but that was so I wouldn't get involved.

97
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,350
You were struggling to keep your mouth shut, weren't you?!

98
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,110
Mom...

99
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,110
I had no idea...

100
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,830
that you were suffering here.

101
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,180
I always wondered why I was the only unfortunate one.

102
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,130
When I was living in poverty with Grandpa...

103
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,660
When I was all alone after Grandpa died...

104
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,480
I blamed it all on you for abandoning me.

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,600
I had no idea.

106
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,670
I didn't know anything at all.

107
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,910
That you were protecting me this whole time.

108
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,520
Now it's my turn!

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,400
Now it's my turn to save you, mom!

110
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,370
Now I'm going to protect you, mom!!

111
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,800
I won't leave you in there!!

112
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,770
This time we'll leave this place for sure!

113
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,130
Both of us are going up together!

114
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,400
So mom...

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,050
Open the door!

116
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,400
Please, mom!

117
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
Mom!!

118
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,010
Mo...!

119
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,180
Stop it!

120
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,640
Your mom isn't here.

121
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,580
Didn't I tell you that?

122
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,760
M-Mom...

123
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,790
That's not true.

124
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,360
If you want to see her so badly, I'll let you.

125
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,360
Personally...

126
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,650
H-Hosen!

127
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,350
Oops, we've been found.

128
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,500
Take her with you if you want.

129
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,140
Child, that is your mother.

130
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,530
Hinowa isn't your mother.

131
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,670
Your mother left this world long ago.

132
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,520
What are you...talking about...

133
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:26,200
You think a courtesan of Yoshiwara could give birth to a child unnoticed?

134
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,860
Eight years ago, a prostitute became pregnant with a child.

135
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,290
But becoming pregnant in Yoshiwara means death for both.

136
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:42,930
So a number of the women hid her and secretly assisted the birth.

137
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,280
Yes...

138
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,520
That was you, child!

139
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,040
Your mother was weak and died after giving birth to you.

140
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,750
Unfortunately, the woman over there isn't your mother.

141
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,750
Dreaming of becoming a mother, yet couldn't.

142
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,950
Just a pathetic women who immersed herself in playing a mother role.

143
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,340
Why...

144
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,660
Why did you come to this place?

145
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,520
Why did you come?

146
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,080
You should have just forgotten about someone like me.

147
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,770
Just knowing you lived up there for the rest of us would have been enough.

148
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,150
I'm not worth risking your life to protect.

149
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,060
You won't find your mother anywhere in this world.

150
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,430
Now that you understand, take that memento of her and get lost.

151
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,190
Of course, it's a different story if you wish to see your mother in the afterlife.

152
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,410
I have a mother!

153
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,730
Right here!

154
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,580
My mom is alive!

155
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,650
Right here!

156
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,850
The one who delivered me from this eternal darkness to the surface!

157
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,880
The one who risked her life to give birth to me!

158
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,760
It doesn't matter if we aren't related by blood!

159
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,100
This person is my mom!

160
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,770
You don't know when to give up, child.

161
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,570
I have no choice.

162
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,110
Go meet your real mother in the underworld.

163
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,600
Th-This is...

164
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,080
Hey, I wasn't told about this.

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,930
I came cause they said the best woman in Yoshiwara was here.

166
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,110
But it looks like she's got a kid.

167
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,140
Those tears prove it.

168
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,720
M-Mom...?

169
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,600
Hey manager, get me a different girl.

170
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,720
One that can withstand some really rough SM play.

171
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,930
Who are you?

172
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,620
Nobody special.

173
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,440
Just a girl-loving playboy.

174
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,920
Gi...

175
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,780
Gin-san!!

176
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,860
What are you doing, dummy?

177
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,720
Just get going and don't worry about me.

178
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,150
But...

179
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,570
Is it okay for me to go?

180
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,020
Is it okay for a dirty brat like me

181
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,490
to call such a beautiful person my mom?

182
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,350
You called her that all this time and now you're asking?

183
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,010
Call to her.

184
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,130
Yell "Mom" from the bottom of your heart.

185
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,430
M-Mom...

186
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,370
Are you sure?

187
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,350
Calling someone not related to you...

188
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,540
a dirty woman like me, your mom?

189
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,350
Mom...

190
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,960
Are you sure?

191
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,300
Calling someone who wasn't able to do anything for you...

192
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,020
a woman like me, as your mom?

193
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,970
Mom...

194
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,400
Are you sure?

195
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,100
A woman like me becoming your mom...?

196
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,300
Mom!

197
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,600
Seita!

198
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,520
He was the one from when...

199
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,340
Wow, so he survived.

200
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,580
I see.

201
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,530
You're the ronin the child hired.

202
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,720
Are you the one who's been running wild around my city?

203
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,210
Running wild?

204
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,720
Don't make me laugh.

205
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,270
I haven't bought a single woman.

206
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,360
I see.

207
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,380
Then I'll prepare a banquet for you.

208
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,470
A banquet of blood.

209
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,960
I appreciate the generous gesture, but I'll have to pass.

210
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,470
I can't enjoy a drink while looking at an old geezer's receding hairline.

211
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,860
I can't enjoy a drink at a place like this.

212
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,960
Yeah, you did a fine job with bringing in this many babes.

213
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,280
But it doesn't matter how many beautiful women,

214
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,510
or how much fine liquor you have.

215
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,520
I won't drink a single drop in your place.

216
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,020
I can't enjoy a drink poured by women in chains.

217
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,650
I can't enjoy a drink poured by someone in tears.

218
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,560
I'd take a crappy snack joint full of old ladies instead,

219
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,210
if they serve me with a smile.

220
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,480
I'd take a bar run by a vicious cabaret girl instead,

221
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,350
if everyone could drink and laugh.

222
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,840
I'd take a field in the middle of nowhere with no women, wine, or even a roof instead,

223
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,610
if we could drink cheap liquor and watch the moon.

224
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,990
A woman's tears...

225
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,290
are too much to go with drinking.

226
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,850
So you came to shatter those chains?

227
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,390
To free Hinowa...the woman of Yoshiwara from the King of the Night?

228
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,650
It's not that big a deal.

229
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,530
I just want a drink.

230
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:23,200
And have the finest courtesan serve it to me with one great smile.

231
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,100
How amusing.

232
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,390
Picking a fight with the King of the Night for the sake of a drink.

233
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,100
Guess Earth has its share of amusing people.

234
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Right, Boss Hosen?

235
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,430
Ooh, scary.

236
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,270
Don't be so angry.

237
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,270
Don't worry. I won't interfere with you anymore.

238
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,440
Kamui! What are you after?

239
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,830
After attempting to take my life, you help that child by taking him to Hinowa.

240
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,640
You want to interfere with me that badly?

241
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,980
Or perhaps...

242
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,400
Watching that child long for his mother brought back memories of the past?

243
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,740
You now feel like atoning for abandoning your sick mother?

244
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,720
What nonsense.

245
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,170
I was wondering what sort of woman could turn the King of the Night into a fool,

246
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,190
but she turns out to be a miserable wretch clinging to a dirty brat.

247
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,500
The sun of Yoshiwara? Yeah, right.

248
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,600
This isn't it.

249
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,470
The strength I seek isn't for some cheap crap like this.

250
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,910
Like not hesitating to kill your own sister or father.

251
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,520
Is that what you mean?

252
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,140
Talk about ironic.

253
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,110
If there's a brother willing to kill his real sister,

254
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,970
there are people with bonds stronger than those between a parent and a child.

255
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,290
Who knows which would be considered the real family.

256
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,550
Very amusing.

257
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,370
Why don't you show me how strong those bonds are?

258
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,070
Whether you can release them from my chains...

259
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,460
or for me to break through their bonds.

260
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,260
Let's see who will win!

261
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,300
Can a mere Earthling shatter the chains...

262
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,110
of the King of the Night?!

263
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,290
A chain made from a perverted old man's wet dreams?

264
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,040
I'll break it with a single strike.

265
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,910
Every night has to end eventually.

266
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,720
It's time for this city to see dawn.

267
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,370
The King of the Night can watch the sunrise,

268
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,220
and go nighty night!!

269
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,520
Gin-san!

270
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,180
G-Gin-san!

271
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,180
Ah...

272
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,940
So you blocked my attack?

273
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,490
What the hell...

274
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,760
One hit...

275
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
One strike and it feels like...

276
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,840
my body's lost all its energy and stamina!

277
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,130
Hosen, King of the Night.

278
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,450
This is the power of the man once known as the King of the Yato?

279
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,340
Oh, wow.

280
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,830
You lasted ten seconds against the King of the Night.

281
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,830
This is getting interesting.

282
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,420
Good luck, mister.

283
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,810
I feel like rooting for you now.

284
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,380
Don't look down on me, you damn kid.

285
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,530
Ten seconds? Hell, I'll last till I die of old age.

286
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,230
I'll die peacefully while surrounded by grandchildren, you bastard!

287
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,100
Your life has already ended.

288
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,160
The second you decided to oppose Yoshiwara...the King of the Night!

289
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,500
My bones are grating...

290
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,300
My muscles are crying in pain...

291
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,850
I can't relax a single finger, a single muscle!

292
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,570
I'll be crushed in the next moment!

293
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,520
No time to breath...or even blink!

294
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,880
A single blow forces my soul from my body!

295
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,890
Gin-san!

296
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,120
What, over already?

297
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,140
That's no fun.

298
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,410
It seems you're not just all talk.

299
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,320
Within Earth standards, that is.

300
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,560
Of course, you samurai wouldn't be able to shatter my chains,

301
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,690
when you couldn't even protect your own nation from the Amanto.

302
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,020
When a lion loses a turf war,

303
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,800
it must turn over its land and its females.

304
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,230
Do you understand?

305
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,900
You samurai no longer have a home,

306
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,680
or the right to hold women.

307
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,310
Because your lands and females all became ours long ago!

308
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,020
That's right.

309
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,670
This city, its women, and Hinowa all belong to the King of the Night!

310
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,240
They're chained up as my pets.

311
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,420
They cannot escape anywhere.

312
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,370
And you losers don't have the right to stop me!

313
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,030
It's your fault for being too weak to protect anything!

314
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,850
A loser should act like one and just suck on his thumb...

315
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:14,220
and watch as this nation and its women are violated by the stronger ones!

316
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,600
In the other world, where your comrades are waiting for you!

317
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,740
We haven't lost...

318
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,280
...I'm still fighting!

319
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,770
You son of a...!!

320
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,100
Gin-san!!

321
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
Stay back!!

322
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,680
What are you doing, idiot?

323
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,310
Get going already.

324
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,200
Take your mom and get outta here!

325
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,630
N-No!

326
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,810
Are you telling me to run away by myself and leave you behind?!

327
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:55,640
I can't do that after getting you involved in all of this!

328
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,260
Getting me involved?

329
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,800
I butted in on my own.

330
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,380
Get going.

331
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,850
If something happens to the two of you,

332
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,680
we'll have come here for nothing.

333
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,880
No...!

334
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,340
No way!

335
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,040
I may be useless,

336
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,940
but I'll help you!

337
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,640
I'll stay with you until the end!

338
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,800
You stupid...

339
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,350
You said so!

340
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,620
That there were bonds stronger than family, even when people aren't related by blood?

341
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,430
That's right.

342
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,240
Blood doesn't matter.

343
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,270
You all reformed me from being a thief.

344
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,070
You all taught me how to lead a respectable life.

345
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,480
You all kept me...from being all alone.

346
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,340
It wasn't very long, but it was fun.

347
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,060
Ever since Grandpa died, I never had that much fun.

348
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,990
Just like Mom...

349
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,960
Everybody...Gin-san...

350
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,590
You're all like family to me!

351
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,430
The one and only people who taught me what's important!

352
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,090
And you're telling me to abandon you here?!

353
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,850
To let you die in this place?!

354
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,000
Hearing you say that is more than enough...

355
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,330
Get going.

356
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,280
Don't make me into a loser again.

357
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,560
Gin-san...

358
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,700
Gi...

359
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,850
Gin...!

360
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,990
Gin-san!!

361
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:17,430
[Preview]

362
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,500
What a joke this is.

363
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,810
After all that big talking, look at you!

364
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,330
Where's that sun you promised?

365
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,820
I was a fool for expecting anything from you.

366
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,180
You...stinkin' big bluff!

367
