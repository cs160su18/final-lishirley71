There was a time, long ago, when our country was called by that name.

With the arrival of the "Amanto" from outer space

and the Sword Ban twenty years ago,

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,280
the samurai class fell into decline.

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,160
In such hard times, there was one man left with the spirit of the samurai.

I have no interest in fancy food. Pickles are fine.

324
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,590
You've sure got simple taste for such a pig!!

325
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,840
Hold up, Gintoki! What's with this girl?

326
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,900
She's already had five bowls!

327
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,480
Where's she from?!

328
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,920
Five, huh? She's still got a lot more to go.

329
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,730
All we've got left at home is sugar and salt now.

330
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,900
What's with them? They're so emaciated.

331
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,530
Hey! You're still eating?!

332
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:53,130
Somebody stop her!

333
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,550
[Preview]

334
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,780
We're mistaken for terrorists and are chased by the Shinsengumi.

335
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,350
But Gin's friend, Katsura, helps us out.

336
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,750
Hey, Zura, it's been a while.

337
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,950
The next episode...

338
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,630
"Make Friends You Can Call by Their Nicknames, Even When You're an Old Fart"

339
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,960
[These are the Chinese characters for Shinsengumi. Please don't screw them up.]

340
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,970
[It may seem a bit packed together, but ignore that.]

341
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,020
Umm... Do you have JUMP?

342
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,450
We have Sunday.
