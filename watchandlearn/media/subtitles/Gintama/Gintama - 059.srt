Anyway, I have something to ask you.

92
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,230
That sword, the Benizakura... What is it?

93
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,440
I heard it's a demon sword that brings misfortune.

94
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,910
But I think there's more to it than that...

95
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,180
I don't think it's really a demon sword or something mysterious, and it's...

96
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,130
Unfortunately, I don't know much about the Benizakura, either.

97
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,950
We were never allowed to touch it and it was sealed deep inside the warehouse.

98
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,990
But I have a theory.

99
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,020
A sword made by a master swordsmith who put his heart and soul

100
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,240
into his work just might have a soul of it's own.

101
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,690
Look over there!

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,730
The continuous drip from that roof has worn a hole in that stone!

103
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,690
Even drops of rain can penetrate stone.

104
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,670
What if a world-class swordsmith does the same thing;

105
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,930
forging the same spot with his hammer?!

106
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,180
What if they pounded the iron tens of thousands of times with only the intent of forging a killing weapon?!

107
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,120
A sword like that might be beyond human understanding!

108
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,430
Would it be so strange if such a blade had a will of its own?

109
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,190
That's what I think!

110
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,430
You mean the strength of your father's will transformed cold steel into some kind of monster?

111
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,470
Sounds like a romantic story, huh?

112
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,190
But the spirits of master swordsmiths dwell in the blades they forge.

113
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,110
The sword is forged with one deadly intention. To kill a person.

114
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,170
That's what makes the sword so beautiful.

115
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,140
And so is the swordsmith who imagines it.

116
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,910
Whether it's a sword or a human being, beauty comes from striving towards a single goal!

Oh, come on in. I knew you were coming.

You really overdid it this time.

137

You took the Benizakura without permission and ran back here with only one arm.

Are you ready to commit hari-kiri one handed? Okada-san.

139
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,330
I should get credit for bringing Benizakura back even though I lost an arm.

140
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,890
You should rethink my diligence in a situation like that.

141
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,300
I think it was a valuable learning experience.

142
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,120
Your selfish behavior the past few days has been too much.

143

What are you going to do if the Bakufu government's dogs find out about the Benizakura?

144

You're distracting Shinsuke-sama.

You're angering Shinsuke-sama by targeting those people.

147
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,890
What were you thinking, anyway?

148
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,150
You think you've become a big man? Don't delude yourself!

149
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,130
You only defeated Katsura because of the Benizakura...

Oh, it's nothing personal...

Okada-san, you...

159
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,740
They're really bothersome.

160
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,740
We've gathered here under him to overthrow this corrupt government.

161
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,340
We are, so to speak, trying to become legends.

162
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,820
But we're still just Kira kira...

163
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,330
[Note: Possibly a reference to Kira Kozukenosuke, the lord who was the target of the 47 ronin of Ako.]

164
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,330
It's an eyesore. A real thorn in our side.

165
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:22,490
Isn't it time for the old legends to die and the new legends to rise up?

166
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,450
They're not the ones at his side anymore.

167
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,930
We are.

168
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:34,100
The Benizakura was created based on my father's original Benizakura.

169
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,970
It's a mechanized anti-battleship weapon.

170
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,890
Endowed with a kind of artificial intelligence called an "Electric Soul."

171
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,710
It lives like a parasite and takes over its wielder's body.

172
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:49,310
It even has the ability to record battles, analyze them and grow smarter.

173
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,250
It truly is alive.

174
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,910
Only one person in Edo could create such a thing.

175
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,010
Please.

176
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,690
Stop my brother.

177
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:08,170
They're...Takasugi is...going to use it to turn Edo into a sea of flames.

178
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,890
Such insanity.

179
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,320
To create a sword like this in an era of firearms and cannons.

180
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,990
I think a man who boasts about overthrowing the Bakufu

181
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,970
with that sword is also insane.

182
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,710
A man who turns his boasts into reality is called a hero.

183
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,070
I don't boast about what I can't do.

184
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,500
You truly are the son of the one-of-a-kind swordsmith, Jintetsu Murata.

185
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,700
It's unbelievable that you created something like this.

186
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,870
I've heard of a black hen laying a white egg, but in your case, it goes beyond that.

187
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,700
Let's show them that the samurai and sword are far from extinct.

188
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,050
I'm not interested in your plots or ambition!

189
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,590
A swordsmith lives only to forge killing swords!

190
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,890
The only thing I can say is...

191
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,470
There's nothing this sword can't cut!

192
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,020
Shinsuke Takasugi. Are you saying he's

193
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,810
the major figure behind Katsura-san's disappearance and Nizo Okada?

194
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,380
While we were looking for Katsura-san, we followed many leads, but...

195
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,050
...we never thought we'd find another exclusionist rebel behind his disappearance.

196
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,020
And speaking of Shinsuke Takasugi, he was Katsura-san's old ally,

197
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,160
and they fought in the Anti-Foreigner War together. So why would he...?

198
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,910
According to rumors, Takasugi revived the Kiheitai

199
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,470
along with Nizo the Butcher; the gun fighter Matako "Crimson Bullet" Kijima;

200
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:54,680
that scheming pervert Henpeita Takechi; and the feared swordsman, Bansai Kawakami.

201
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,270
The Kiheitai?

202
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,180
It's a volunteer army led by Takasugi.

203
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,190
It's said they fight like ferocious demons.

204
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,530
I also heard that they're secretly developing devastating weapons.

205
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,010
His goal is to most likely form a strong-armed group to launch a coup d'état.

206
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,400
Katsura-san renounced violence

207
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,600
and seeks to restore Edo's sovereignty by more peaceful means.

208
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,410
Maybe Takasugi was angry with him for his change of heart.

209
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,570
Anyway, we have to do something!

210
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,610
Elizabeth-san, let's attack Takasugi's hideout!!

211
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,260
Let's avenge Katsura-san!

212
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,350
[Calm down.]
[Note: The character "mo" is crossed out. Thus, it originally said mochitsuke, meaning "Pound mochi."]

213
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,600
Take Takasugi's head!

214
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,140
I see. Takasugi...

215
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,040
I don't know much about the situation,

216
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,600
but it sounds like your brother is involved in a hell of a mess.

217
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,520
And... I can say that your brother used me like a pawn.

218
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,530
He asked me to look for a demon sword because he intended it to drink my blood.

219
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:02,600
Or he was asked by Nizo, who carries a grudge against me... Or maybe it was both.

220
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,880
Either way, it's bad. And you knew it all along, didn't you?

221
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,810
You knew your brother's plan, and yet you said nothing.

222
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,660
And now you're asking me to save him?

223
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,630
Your skin is as thick as the monthly Shonen JUMP.

224
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,340
[Note: The monthly JUMP is thicker than the weekly JUMP. He's asking if she has thick skin.]

225
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,340
I'm sorry. I have nothing to say.

226
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,700
Like you said, I knew everything...

227
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,750
But I didn't tell you because I didn't want the truth to get out...

228
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,980
that my brother was involved.

229
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,990
You sound like the little sister who's just trying to protect her brother.

230
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,650
Aren't you ignoring the fact that your brother is an accomplice to murder?

231
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,980
Gin-san!

232
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,950
After all, swords are made for killing people.

233
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,400
No matter how much heart and soul you put into its creation, you can't choose its user.

234
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,390
My dead father always said that.

235
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,100
His words are ingrained in our minds.

236
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,810
My brother is an idiot who only cares about making swords.

237
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,150
He wanted to surpass our father, so he was always pounding iron.

238
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,040
Soon after, he started researching machinery to gain greater power.

239
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,980
That was around the same time he begun associating with shady people.

240
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,050
I was vaguely aware that they were bad people, but I didn't stop him.

241
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,320
I told myself that all we needed to do was just forge swords.

242
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,130
That's our job...

243
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,690
I knew it. A sword is for butchering people.

244
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,420
It was just a tool for murder.

245
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,820
I knew...

246
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,680
Yet... What a shame...

247
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,870
My brother worked so hard to make that sword...

248
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,110
And it's being used for such a low purpose.

249
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,580
But things are reaching the point where I can't stop it on my own.

250
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,430
I really don't know what to do.

251
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,390
What should I do?

252
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,090
I don't know what to do anymore than you do.

253
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm wounded really badly.

254
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,840
And my friend got taken out, too. So I'm not at my best right now.

255
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,920
Here! I don't want your consolation money. Just go home.

256
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,120
I don't want any more trouble.

257
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,280
Since Gin-san is out of action, it's up to me.

258
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,220
There's no doubt that Kagura-chan is on that ship.

259
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,050
But how can I sneak aboard?

260
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:29,260
This place is crawling with scary looking ronin. What should I do...?

261
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,100
What the hell is that?!

262
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,710
Ow... That bastard, Nizo. He's really out of control.

263
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,230
I wonder if that sword is even safe to use. I could feel the evil in it.

264
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,980
Let me go!

265
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,520
Don't think you'll get away with this!

266
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,690
Don't come crying to me when you're beaten up by Gin-chan!

267
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,880
Geez. She's already wreaking havoc.

268
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,760
That's why I told you we should get rid of her.

269
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,770
Look at what this brat has done to our men, Takechi-senpai!

270
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,060
We can't kill her yet. She has valuable information.

271
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:20,940
Besides, a girl her age will be in her prime in a few years.

272
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,030
Your Lolita complex is showing again, Senpai.

273
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,950
I don't have a Lolita complex. I'm a feminist.

274
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,110
Look! Her gunshot wound has already healed in just one night

275
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,190
and her extraordinary strength and snow white skin...

276
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,530
Senpai, please cut it out.

277
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:45,180
No, don't misjudge me. I'm a feminist with a healthy affection for children.

278
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,100
That's someone who has a Lolita complex!

279
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,940
Never mind.

280
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,560
I don't think you understand, idiot.

281
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,750
You're the idiot.

282
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm saying those characteristics are prevalent among the Yato clan.

283
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,520
You should die.

284
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Yato... Is that the mercenary clan, Yato?

285
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,070
Does that mean she's a professional assassin who was hired to kill Shinsuke-sama?

286
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,170
Who the hell is she a spy for?

287
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,280
Well, no matter what we asked, she kept saying "zura, zura."

288
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,920
Senpai, she's mocking you.

289
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,470
I don't care whether you're a feminist or have a Lolita complex.

290
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,070
It's really disgusting. I'll show you how easily I handle this girl.

291
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,740
Hey,

292
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,480
...you...

293
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,640
You!

294
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,890
Do you understand your situation?! I'll kill you!

295
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,620
N-No! This girl will be breathtaking in another two or three years.

296
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,980
Don't stop me, Takechi-hentai!

297
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,320
I'm your Senpai, not Hentai!

298
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,070
Hey, who are you, anyway?

299
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,320
You look really suspicious.

300
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,970
You're the most suspicious person I've ever seen in my life!

301
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,630
You look like the ideal picture of a suspicious person.

302
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,010
Whoa! What is that person doing?! Oops, she's not human.

303
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,370
Be careful! She's going to get killed!

304
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,740
[Excuse me. Would you give me some directions?]

305
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,210
[To the entrance of Hell!!]

306
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,570
Phlegm throughout my body, give me strength!

307
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,800
It's so disgusting. Hey, please stop it!

308
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,150
Loogie!!

309
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Eat this!!

310
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,380
What?!

What?!

312
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,070
What do you mean "what?!" You spit all over my face.

313
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,060
Hey, why are you only cleaning off my phlegm?!

314

It's said, "If you get phlegm on your right cheek,

315
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,870
you should get it on your left cheek, too!"

316
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,590
What are you doing?!

317
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,580

Elizabeth Senpai!

321
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,120
I'm relieved.

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,810
I was afraid you'd try to go out despite your injuries.

323
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,590
You'd die if you went out in your condition.

324
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,140
You're right.

325
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,450
I feel sorry for that girl, but it can't be helped.

326
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,780
...You're right.

327

Please don't overdo it.

329

If you die, Shin-chan and Kagura-chan would be lost without you, Gin-san.

330
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,760
...You're right.

331
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,490
Gin-san, you were pretty wild in your youth,

332
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,880
but you've got to start acting your age now, you know?

333
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,420
That's enough, damn it! I'm not going anywhere,

334
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,770
so just go out and buy me JUMP!

The last one you bought was an Akamaru JUMP.

337
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,750
That's the kind of mistake my mom would make!

338
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,910
Yes, yes. I understand.

339
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,030
I'm sorry.
