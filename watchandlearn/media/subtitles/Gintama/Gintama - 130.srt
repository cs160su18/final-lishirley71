[Please turn on the light and keep your distance away from the television when watching the show, woof!]

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,020
[A request from Kintaro, woof!]

4
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,000
Take care of the rest, Leader!

5
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,020
I have discovered Bushido in a death surrounded by cuddly balls of flesh!

["Cat Lovers and Dog Lovers Are Mutually Exclusive."]

7
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,790
What's he doing?!

8
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,350
He's not stopping a thing!

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,790
Guess we have no choice, then.

10
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,450
You'll just have to be the bait.

11
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,660
In the meantime, I'll rush over to the old man!

12
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,660
What good will that do?!

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,350
The deal was to let me meet with the old man!

14
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,440
Finally got you, Planet Eater!

15
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,810
You're...the Puke Shogun!

16
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,530
I pursued you, inhabited the body of a stray cat, and lived in trash bins for years!

17
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,810
By exterminating your kind, we will be released from these bodies!

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,550
Let go!

19
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,680
The curse of the balls of flesh will be broken today!

20
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,370
I cannot die. I cannot...die yet!

21
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,460
It was karma that made you inhabit a smelly dog!

22
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,770
It's useless to resist!

23
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,220
Resign yourself and die!

24
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,270
Don't take me lightly, Puke Shogun!

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,140
Get a taste of this ultimate technique, which I perfected over these past eighteen years!

26
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,270
Candlelight Last Sparking!

27
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,950
Looked like an ordinary flip to me.

28
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,270
It's the Candlelight Last Sparking!

29
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,670
Never thought it would come in handy.

30
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,200
This may seem like a strange question...

31
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,890
but did a large dog, a little dog, and a little leader pass by?

32
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,610
I don't know. What do you mean by little leader?

33
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,390
Small in stature, but big in ability.

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,340
So I guess I should say, big leader.

35
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,530
Well, I don't know.

36
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,740
Strange. Maybe the leader isn't here yet.

37
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,330
A bizarre bunch like that would attract lots of attention.

38
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,000
You're bizarre, too.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,190
Could they have been caught by the balls of flesh?

40
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,580
Hey, did you find him, Jiro?

41
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,530
Nope.

42
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,440
Saburo, you should have kept an eye on him!

43
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,470
Who'd think someone so sick could get up?!

44
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,120
Damn it! Where the hell would he have gone in that condition?

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,230
Could it be...

46
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,950
that he has gone to find Kintaro?!

47
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,490
That's impossible... Not in that condition.

48
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,010
'Scuse me. Someone called me.

49
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,560
Oh, there he is.

50
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,940
Mr. Odd Jobs!

51
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,760
Hey there.

52
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Sorry, but we have a problem.

53
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,810
Huh? The master of a parasitic alien?

54
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,990
Yeah.

55
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,170
Actually, the leader and I were attempting to get the alien and the master together.

56
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,520
Hey, let me ride!

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,430
Got yourself involved in another messy situation, eh?

58
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,290
I heard he was on his deathbed and never imagined he would leave the hospital.

59
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,160
Say, let me ride! Just move the doll.

60
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,660
No way. This is Kagura's stand-in, Suzanne.

61
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,310
Oh hello, I'm Katsura.

62
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,680
And where's Kagura?

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,610
Oh right! The leader's being pursued by a parasitic alien and is in danger.

64
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,910
What?! Is that true?

65
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,640
You seem to have your hands full, but will you help?

66
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,100
All right! Let's split up members.

67
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,530
All right, please take care of the rest!

68
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,890
I'm counting on you, Suzanne.

69
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,680
Don't be a burden now.

70
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,360
There are cats everywhere.

71
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,610
I can't tell which ones are real cats and which ones are those aliens.

72
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,710
Damn it!

73
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,220
I exhausted my energy in that earlier scuffle, and my life gauge is down to five.

74
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:27,100
[Life Gauge]

75
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:27,100
[Smoke one cigarette and you lose one bar.]

76
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,200
Since when did you have that setting?

77
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,200
Look what you did.

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,010
Now I have to conquer the world with only five bars left.

79
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,100
That's one bar per continent.

80
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,840
Five is plenty in order to see the old man.

81
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,100
I said, I won't see him! You're so persistent!

82
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,180
Well, never mind.  In any case,

83
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,150
it's dark, so let's get some light.

84
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,060
Where're you taking the light from?!

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,840
What fool uses someone's life candle for lighting purposes?!

86
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,160
And how the hell did you do that? How'd you materialize it just now?

87
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,700
Stop yammering, will ya? Here, I'll give you my life candle.

88
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,830
Give me...? You can do such a thing?

89
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,490
Here. How's that?

90
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,620
Hey, it's burning so bright! Isn't this fireworks?!

91
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,000
Even if it's a short life, burn hot and bright and overtake the moment.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,680
That's my way of life.

93
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,980
Who cares about your way of life! You're melting the candle next to it!

94
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,510
Extinguish it! Put it out right now!

95
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,390
Who extinguishes it like that?!

96
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,290
Hey, you put an extra candle out!

97
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,450
Now there's only three left!  I can't breathe.

98
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,330
Hey, hang on! Do you intend to die before you see the old man?!

99
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,640
Intend to die? It's mostly you guys who're killing me.

100
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,890
I'm not gonna see the old man. I can't let him see me like this.

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,280
You're that adamant about not seeing your master?

102
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,860
Yes.

103
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,960
Maybe he was a bother to you,

104
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,600
but you were also able to survive to this day because of him.

105
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,440
What's wrong with seeing him just one more time?

106
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,870
For him, you were a friend who sustained his lonely existence for many years.

107
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,100
You damn brat...

108
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,300
That old man... he's not like that.

109
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,240
We weren't like that.

110
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,710
We came to this park often together.

111
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,010
We had a set course we walked.

112
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,760
To observers, we were an old man and his old dog.

113
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,510
We may've looked extremely close.

114
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:29,210
No one could have imagined that we both wished the other would "Die!"

115
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,720
[Kintaro]

116
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,790
Yeah, that was the first word he ever uttered to me.

117
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
Die!

118
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,060
That's what the old man always said.

119
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,600
Damn you! Die!

120
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,790
If he didn't like something, that's what he said, no matter who it was.

121
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,810
Get outta here!

122
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,260
To his wife, to his friends, and to me.

123
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,140
I don't know if that was the reason.

124
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,290
But one by one, the people around him died.

125
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,880
And in time, the old man was all alone.

126
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,890
And yet, he still kept on living.

127
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,250
You're a stubborn one too. Hurry up and die.

128
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,840
Because, he still had someone to say, "Die" to.

129
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,640
Kintaro...

130
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,260
The old lady is gone and so are all my friends.

131
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,700
You're the only one left.

132
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,230
Do you know why I stay away from my kids even after my wife's gone,

133
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,970
and continue living alone?

134
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,040
I don't want them to see my dying face.

135
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,710
In my time, I've seen many a dying face, but it sucks.

136
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,020
It's not something you can show others.

137
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,260
I'm not gonna let anyone see such a shriveled-up face. No thanks.

138
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,960
I'm gonna die alone, unnoticed by anyone.

139
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,260
So Kintaro, hurry up and die. You're the only one left.

140
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,920
You die, you old bastard!

141
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,810
We've gone on living, cursing each other to die.

142
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,410
I waited for the old man to die so I could conquer Earth.

143
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,060
I couldn't die, no matter what.

144
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,290
I survived, even if I had to crawl through life.

145
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,310
But the old man kept living, too.

146
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,900
As if he was competing with me, he didn't fall.

147
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,080
No matter what illness he caught, he overcame it.

148
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,670
He would stand before me as though nothing had happened, and sneer at me.

149
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,560
We never showed each other our weaknesses.

150
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,950
We'd drag our weary bodies and force ourselves to go walking.

151
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,370
Our legs could barely move,

152
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,620
but we kept our pride and ran.

153
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,010
There wasn't a shred of feeling support for one another.

154
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,050
All we lived for was to outlast the other by a day, a minute, even a second.

155
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,110
That's how we are.

156
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,060
The old man is no different from me.

157
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,380
And you think the old man would be happy to see me?

158
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,060
If he sees me, he'd get an adrenalin rush and get up again.

159
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,810
Leaving him alone is the best thing.

160
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,450
I'm sick of him, that persistent old man!

161
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,260
Wanting to see him doesn't even cross my mind.

162
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,150
I wish he'd hurry up and die!

163
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,990
What is that?

164
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,550
O-Old...

165
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,820
...man!

166
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,260
Old man!

167
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,830
Wh-What are you doing here?! You're supposed to be on your deathbed.

168
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,470
He's holding something.

169
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,960
A leash?

170
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,100
No way!

171
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,400
A walk? He thinks he's taking a walk?!

172
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,140
He's barely conscious, yet he left the hospital, and...

173
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,800
he's taking a walk...with me?!

174
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,550
Kintaro... I won't lose.

175
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
I still have...

176
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,300
O-Old man...why'd you come here?

177
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,100
He's still competing with me, even in his condition?

178
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,020
Enough already. I've had enough!

179
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,280
Enough.

180
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,510
Can't you understand, you old bastard?!

181
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,600
I...I can't stand to see you like that.

182
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,720
Wait! Watch out!

183
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,920
I found you. I found you, Planet Eater!

184
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,150
You can't escape now.

185
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,640
You are an evil presence.

186
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,130
We will erase each and every one of you...

187
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,430
...from the universe!

188
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,770
Y-You!

189
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,830
Hurry!

190
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,220
Hurry and go!

191
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,300
How long must he walk alone?!

192
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,210
I'm not telling you to say good-bye.

193
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,130
Go tell him to die.

194
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,430
Curse and rant at him until the very end.

195
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,230
Stay and fight with him.

196
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,850
Stay and die with him!

197
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,790
And that'll do...for you two.

198
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,960
That's what you two are.

199
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,260
You're still going to get in our way?!

200
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,970
This one is trying to destroy this planet!

201
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,470
If you defend him, we'll consider you a danger to this planet, too!

202
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,420
I don't care what you do to stop the conquest of Earth.

203
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,890
But there's two things we mustn't interfere with when it comes to this dog.

204
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,750
That's the time to eat and the time to take a walk!

205
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,100
Shogun! Our offensive isn't working at all!

206
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,710
What's with that girl's fighting strength?!

207
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,280
She's even stronger than the Planet Eater!

208
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,110
Summon Omega!

209
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,240
Omega?! It's too dangerous!

210
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,250
This is no time to be saying that!

211
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,510
She is another threat to the planet! We must not let her escape!

212
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,560
Parasite Omega.

213
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,010
Even among Planet Pukers, it had superior strength and was known as the Sweeper.

214
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,130
Omega was born from the power of alcohol in a cross-fertilization of Planet Eaters and Planet Pukers,

215
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,230
and was the ultimate warrior possessing the strengths of both.

216
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,390
However, at the same time, it was psychologically unstable,

217
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,780
and could go into a frenzy that matched the Planet Eaters.

218
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,970
Shogun, if we're not careful, this planet could be destroyed with us on it!

219
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,500
That's the risk we must take in order to stop this new menace!

220
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,390
It's over for you guys!

221
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,890
Omega! Burn everything in sight!

222
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,350
Hello, I'm Omemi. Nice to meet you.

223
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,710
So, my time is near, eh?

224
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,480
I can see cats flying through the air.

225
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,400
The candles. Two of my life candles have been broken!

226
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,100
I only have one left!

227
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,030
What the hell is she doing?!

228
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,140
Go! Hurry!

229
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,390
A walk?! Is she crazy?

230
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,870
I'm way past being able to do that!

231
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,330
I-I can't even stand.

232
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,760
The old man's candle was probably snuffed out just now!

233
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,960
Old man!

234
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,010
What?! There's only one candle left, and he's standing!

235
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,510
Kintaro, so you're finally at death's doorstep? How pitiful!

236
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,530
I'm still fit as a fiddle. If you're unable to take a walk, it's over for a human.

237
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,810
Old geezers should hurry and die!

238
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,600
D-Don't take me lightly, you damn bastard!

239
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,390
I've still got it. I'll never lose to an old geezer like you!

240
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,830
Hey, don't force yourself.

241
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,930
I know... that you're already half-dead.

242
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,560
Same goes for you.

243
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,580
What a stubborn dog.

244
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,680
Damn old buzzard! Die!

245
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,460
Please...

246
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,280
Die!

247
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,920
Dear, what a thing to say!

248
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:52,400
That pup's mother and siblings died after a difficult birth and it's all alone.

249
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,380
That's why I'm saying it should've died, too!

250
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,650
And I'm saying that's a mean thing to say!

251
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,110
That's not mean at all!

252
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,100
What's mean is the mother and the siblings dying, leaving him all alone.

253
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,600
It's way harder being the one left behind.

254
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:14,840
I don't have the confidence to live long enough until he's old and dies.

255
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:21,260
If he's gonna be left all alone again, it would've been better if he had died, too.

256
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,880
That's the point I'm making.

257
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,690
I'm here.

258
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,310
There's no way I'll die before you!

259
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,900
I'm ten years younger than you.

260
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,260
You can never depend on a woman.

261
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,310
You and I have different resolves.

262
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,340
Hey, you... Unfortunately, I'm an old man.

263
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,650
I can't be a surrogate mom or brother to you. But I can be your buddy.

264
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,460
Buddies are great. Age, sex, family, relationships don't matter.

265
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,020
If you have a lover, your wife'll beat you up.

266
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,390
But you can have as many friends as you like and no one'll complain.

267
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,770
But because of it, I go by a single rule.

268
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,370
Don't die before your friend.

269
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,530
I hate it when you have lots of friends here and there,

270
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,060
and you go and die and make them all sad.

271
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,640
So, you live until you're all alone and you cry alone.

272
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,810
You watch them all die, then you die alone.

273
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,930
Even if I cry, I'll never make a buddy cry.

274
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,810
That's my rule when making a friend.

275
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,220
So rest assured. You'll never need to cry because you're all alone.

276
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,080
After you die, I'll cry for you.

277
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,080
So rest assured and die, buddy.

278
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,300
You old bastard, enough already.

279
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,310
That's enough...

280
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,920
Stop...please.

281
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,710
Hurry and die...

282
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,240
I don't want to see... I don't want to see you...

283
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,080
hanging in there and suffering.

284
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,480
I don't want to see it anymore!

285
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,720
You won't get away, Planet Eater!

286
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,930
If you die, the extermination of Planet Eaters will be over.

287
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,500
Then we will be released from this body of flesh.

288
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,100
We'll change our parasite hosts and eradicate those beasts!

289
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,430
It's our victo--!

290
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,680
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

291
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,600
I can't fire! Huh? Huh?!

292
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,610
Huh?!

293
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,680
Hey, did I just do something?

294
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,430
I think you did.

295
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,700
I thought that if I didn't go to see him, he could die in peace.

296
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,640
Why'd he come here? Was it just to suffer?

297
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,970
If I die, you'll be at peace, right?

298
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,480
If I die first, you'll be at peace and can die too, right?

299
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,250
But, I don't think we can do that anymore, old man.

300
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,590
I can't die before you die.

301
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,470
Damn, I'm starting to lose it, old man.

302
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,720
I don't know when it happened, but more than being the King of Terror...

303
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,230
I've wanted to be your buddy.

304
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,570
So I can't make you cry!

305
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,220
So, why don't you hurry up and die, old man?!

306
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,220
Die, old man!

307
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,780
Please die!

308
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,180
Old man, die! Die!

309
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,330
Die! You old bastard!

310
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,340
K-Kintaro...

311
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,510
I win.

312
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,620
Because you...made your buddy cry.

313
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,810
Th-Thanks...

314
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,790
Buddy...

315
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,600
Sadaharu, let's go.

316
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,100
The next episode:

317
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,840
"Fights Often Ensue During Trips"

318
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:26,140
[Around this time last year we had to skip an episode because of the Japan Series. And this year...]

319
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,050
[We're Not Skipping!]
