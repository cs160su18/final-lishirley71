[Okita's sister, Mitsuba, falls ill right before her marriage to Kuraba.]

[Okita only wishes for his sister's remaining days to be happy, but the cold-hearted Hijikata will have none of that.]

Gin-san...

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,520
What were you and Yamazaki-san talking about yesterday?

7
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,600
Huh? Nothing. Don't worry about it.

8
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,970
If you put it like that, it makes me worry even more.

9
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,150
Come on, don't ask silly questions.

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,790
When men get together and talk secretly about something...

11
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,640
...then it's gotta be about this. You wanna see it?

[The Nurse's Fluttering Flowers.]

13
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,700
Oh my!

14
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,300
I guess boys will always be boys.

15
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,810
They'll get together and be up to no good.

16
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,930
Just like them...

17
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,090
That's all for today.

They look the happiest when they're with other guys.

19
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,810
There really was no room for girls.

20
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,260
And then they left without me.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,010
They didn't even look back.

22
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,340
What a bunch of terrible guys to have left such a good woman behind.

23
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,490
I know. That's why I'm going to become super happy and put them all to shame!

24
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,670
Being single up to this age and my poor health have caused So-chan a lot of worry.

25
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,740
I have to find happiness so So-chan will no longer have to worry about me.

26
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,230
Yes, I have to become happy.

has some shady connections with the Anti-Foreigner Faction.

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,920
Hey, you okay? You should get some rest.

30
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,960
You're putting stress on your body.

31
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,990
I'm...okay...

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,400
I just want to talk with someone for a little bit...

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,730
...more...

34
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,760
Hey!

35
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,640
Her condition suddenly turned worse.

36
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,860
It's not looking good.

37
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,300
Her family should prepare for the worst.

38
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,400
That's what the doctor said.

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,900
Vice-Chief, please go to her.

40
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,180
How can you work at a time like this?

41
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,350
And not only that, you're going to arrest Mitsuba's fiancé of all people...

42
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,270
That's cruel...too cruel.

43
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,470
Please think of Mitsuba and Captain Okita's feelings.

44
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,650
I don't think you're doing the wrong thing.

45
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,480
If we leave them be, then eventually their weapons may kill one of our own.

46
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,340
But what should be done right now...isn't this.

47
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,990
Hijikata-san, this is not where you should be right now.

48
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,260
Humph.

49
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,320
Are you trying to say I'm cold and heartless?

50
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,510
I don't think so.

51
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,110
His wife is dying and yet the husband's out here trying to cut a deal.

52

Hijikata-san.

53
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,590
Yamazaki, you haven't told anyone else about this, have you?

54
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,830
N-No...

55
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,980
So you and I are the only ones in the organization who know of this, right?

56
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,480
Yes.

57
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,840
In that case, I want you to keep this matter confidential, okay?

58
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,590
Vice-Chief! You're not thinking of...!

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,310
Vice-Chief!!

60
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,670
Sogo!

61
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,060
You should get some rest.

62
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,750
You haven't slept a wink since yesterday.

63
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,150
I'll switch with you. I've already slept.

64
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,540
Those dark circles.

65
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,770
It's just makeup.

66
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,330
Huh?

67
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,770
Man, it must be nice to be carefree like that.

68
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,290
What's he doing here anyway?

69
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,400
I heard you had a huge fight with Toshi.

70
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,460
It's not like you to lose.

71
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,420
Please don't talk about that bastard right now.

72
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,520
He didn't go into detail, but this is what he told me.

73
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,440
He said he feels like he would never lose to you right now.

74
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,120
I asked you not to talk about him!

75
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,320
What's the deal? Why does everyone talk about Toshi all the time?

76
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,930
So where the hell is that bastard right now?

77
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,410
My sister's like this yet he won't even show his face.

78
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,490
So he doesn't give a damn if a woman he dumped is dying?

79
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,420
Well I guess that's how it is when you're popular with the girls, huh?

80
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,160
Looks like you are tired after all. You should get some rest.

81
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,910
Do you despise me now?

82
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,020
Go rest.

83
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,880
Am I just a nuisance?

84
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,400
Unlike Hijikata-san...

85
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,900
Chief!!

86
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,830
This is terrible!!

87
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,510
The Vice-Chief is...!!

88
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,320
Hm?

89
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,880
You're Toma Kuraba of Tenkaiya, right?

90
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,740
The jig is up.

91
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,700
Cooperate and this will go easier for you.

92
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,440
You're that guy from before...

93
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,530
You are under arrest on charges of smuggling weapons and illegal dealings with ronin.

94
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,180
Come with me quietly.

95
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,460
So you can arrest your friend's fiancé without any hesitation?

96
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,890
You've got a lot of nerve.

97
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,960
Getting involved with a relative of the Shinsengumi while dirtying your hands in a crime like this...

98
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,000
You've got a lot of nerve.

99
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,680
Toshi went by himself?

100
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,800
Yamazaki! Why didn't you say anything?

101
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,870
I'm sorry!

102
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,150
But the Vice-Chief swore me to secrecy.

103
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,210
If the members found out that Captain Okita's relative is connected to Anti-Foreigner Faction samurai,

104
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,310
then the captain would lose his position in the Shinsengumi.

105
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,600
Damn Toshi! He planned on doing this by himself from the start.

106
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,820
How reckless of him.

107
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,970
...Why...

108
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,820
Whatever. What you do is up to you.

109
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,360
That bastard!

110
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,610
Don't you dare go anywhere.

111
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,560
Stay by Mitsuba-dono.

112
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,590
Besides...

113
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,380
...right now, you'll just get in the way.

114
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,110
Those who hesitate with their sword will die.

115
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,920
So you want me to trust you?

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,440
You've gotta be kidding me.

117
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,480
There's no way I'm gonna be indebted to that bastard.

118
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,820
Kondo-san... You have the wrong idea about me.

119
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,490
I'm not as pure as you think I am.

120
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm not one to trust others.

121
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,390
I only think of myself.

122
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,970
Even when we were together, I always felt a gap between us.

123
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,040
I always felt I was different from you guys.

124
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,520
That's why, my sister, you and him...

125
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,940
Chief!

126
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,710
Boy, you really are harsh on me, aren't you, Kondo-san?

127
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,550
That's because you're a kid.

128
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,000
If Toshi said the same thing as you, I would've hit him too.

129
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,440
Isn't that how our relationship is?

130
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,560
If one of us strayed, then the other two will punch him back to where he belongs.

131
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,840
It's always been like that.

132
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,440
That's why we'll never stray. We'll always live a straight life.

133
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,910
We don't know anything about this small gap that you claim to have built.

134
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,410
But I'll keep jumping over that and punching you out as many times as I can.

135
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,940
Friends like that are hard to find in this life.

136
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,010
We're really lucky, you know.

137
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,370
To have found two bad friends like that in our lives.

138
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,590
Sogo...

139
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:53,010
If I ever go astray, it will be your turn to punch me, all right?

140
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,000
She loved him...

141
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,840
With all her might...

142
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,360
Even after being treated so coldly by him, she still waited for him to come home.

143
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,150
She always did.

144
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,130
She finally got over him and was about to be happy when...

145
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,390
...he appeared again.

146
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,100
How many times will he stand in the way of my sister's happiness?

147
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,210
What an asshole.

148
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,070
He's an asshole. He really is...

149
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,080
But I know... I know that my sister would never fall in love with an asshole.

150
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,640
In all honesty, I understood.

151
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,900
I understood that a guy who always faced death couldn't risk taking care of my sister.

152
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:54,000
I understood...that he turned her down because he thought that would be better for my sister.

153
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,300
I understood...that all he really wanted was for my sister to be happy.

154
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,620
I understood all of this... But it still gets on my nerves.

155
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,640
He pisses me off.

156
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,310
And that's fine with me.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,320
All right then...

158
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,910
Boss, thanks for listening to my long story.

159
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't tell my sister this, okay?

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,630
Oh, never mind, it's not like you were listening anyway.

161
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,100
He took away a lot of important things from me, but I still gotta go.

162
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,460
Kondo-san told me I'd die.

163
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,710
So this may be the last time.

164
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:46,880
[Note: Jizo statues are part of the Buddhist religion and said to be guardians of dead children.]

165
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,790
I just needed to get it all off my chest to someone, even if it's to a Jizo statue.

166
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,300
One of the important things you talked about...

167
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,880
...includes him, right?

168
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,660
Boss.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,850
That was a good nap.

170
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,640
I'll go with you so I can shake off this grogginess.

171
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,270
After all, I lied to your sister about how we were friends and all.

172
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,240
I'll be with you till the end, Soichiro-kun.

173
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,240
Boss...those black circles...

174
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,770
Some punks beat me up.

175
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,580
Sister, I'm a lucky guy.

176
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,540
You don't often meet friends like these in your lifetime.

177
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,500
Yet, I already have three of these bad friends in my life.

178
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,210
This is not what you told me, Kuraba-dono.

179
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,920
I thought the Bakufu's dogs were already on our side.

180
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,590
But that's Toshiro Hijikata of the Shinsengumi, feared by all as the demon Vice-Chief.

181
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,000
If he's on our trail, then it'll be trouble for you and for us.

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,870
I'm sure reinforcements will be arriving soon.

183
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,920
No.

184
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,550
It's already too late for reinforcements.

185
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,850
It looks like he really came here by himself.

186
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,660
By himself? Why?

187
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:12,040
Who knows? It's difficult for us merchants to understand how a samurai thinks.

188
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,630
If that's the case...

189
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,610
All we have to do is take care of him and we'll be done.

190
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,320
Let's make sure he disappears, okay?

191
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,950
Doctor!

192
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,590
Her pulse is getting weaker. Her life is in danger.

193
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,830
We did everything we could...but...

194
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,930
Is her family here?

195
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,720
Well, the thing is...

196
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,530
Sister...

197
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,690
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,800
I...

199
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,590
I...

200
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,990
Outta the way! Make way for the Shinsengumi!

201
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,460
Toshi... That idiot...

202
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,140
Who among us would ever want to kick Sogo out of the organization?

203
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,010
We're all comrades, aren't we?

204
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,950
You idiot!

205
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,340
Why do you always put all the burden on yourself?

206
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,570
So you plan on being the bad guy all by yourself too?

207
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,100
I know how you feel, Toshi...

208
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,820
...About Mitsuba-dono!

209
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,250
What a pity.

210
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,010
I'm sure Mitsuba will be sad, too.

211
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,100
To lose one of her old friends.

212
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,510
I really wanted to be on good terms with you people.

213
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,100
If I got the backing of the Shinsengumi,

214
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,110
then I could run my business without any restrictions.

215
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,270
That's why I approached one of your relatives and even set out to marry her,

216
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,120
but who knew she was that sick?

217
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,760
I figured if I had his sister, then Sogo would be easy to control,

218
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,760
but according to her doctor, she doesn't have much time left to live.

219
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,630
It really is a pity.

220
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,640
So from the start, you just used her to get us on your side?

221
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,830
I loved her.

222
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,420
As a merchant, I love things that will make me a profit.

223
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,710
But only as a tool.

224
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:40,160
She was damaged goods, but I gave her happiness like other people.

225
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,120
If anything, she should thank me.

226
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,360
I just want her to taste a bit of happiness like other people before she dies.

227
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,740
It's not like you're that much of a nonconformist, you know.

228
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,490
You and I are alike.

229
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,750
I've also done countless horrible acts.

230
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,070
And to top it off, I'm trying to kill the husband of a woman who's dying.

231
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,620
Yeah, that's pretty cruel.

232
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,210
So you can say, we're like two of a kind.

233
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,150
No wonder they call you the demon Vice-Chief.

234
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,440
I think you and I will get along well.

235
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,300
That's really...

236
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,090
...an exaggeration.

237
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,510
I just...

238
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,610
...want the girl I love to be happy.

239
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,530
A life like that is impossible for a guy like me who lives by the sword.

240
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,950
I just wanted her to marry a normal guy somewhere,

241
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,950
have kids like everyone else and live a normal life.

242
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,540
That's all...

243
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,850
I see...

244
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,590
Well, like I said, it's hard for us merchants to understand how a samurai thinks.

245
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,840
Fire!!

246
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,030
What's going on?

247
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,240
I-I don't know.

248
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,980
Go!

249
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,430
It's the Shinsengumi!

250
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,870
Toshi!!

251
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,420
Die!

252
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,400
Toshi!!

253
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,730
Start the car.

254
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,770
Yes, sir.

255
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,630
I misjudged them.

256
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,270
I guess it's impossible to work with barbaric monkeys after all.

257
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,220
Head to the hospital.

258
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,740
That woman may be dying but she can still be used as a hostage.

259
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,310
You bastard!!

260
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,920
Sh-Shake him off!

261
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,500
What the hell are you doing?

262
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,340
Hurry up and shoot him!

263
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,920
You!

264
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't worry.

265
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,870
I just went to get some rice crackers for her.

266
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,640
You go deliver it to her!

267
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,880
I'm sure she'll be happier to get them from you.

268
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,890
You're leaving me behind.

269
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,820
So make sure you don't go astray.

270
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,210
Walk down the path you have chosen for yourself.

271
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,270

I'm sorry...

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,250
I'm...a good-for-nothing brother.

275
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,930
In the end, I'm the one who robbed you of your happiness.

276
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,470
Sorry...

278
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,260
So-chan,

279
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,410
it's okay.

280
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,180
You've worked so hard...

281
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,630
You've grown...grown up into such a great man.

282
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,740
You've gotten so strong.

283
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,980
...Sis.

284
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,580
I'm not strong... I'm not... I'm...

285
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,540
You mustn't look back...

286
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,370
You're the one who decided, right? Back then...

287
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,940
It was the path you chose.

288
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,730
Then you mustn't apologize...

289
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,060
And you mustn't cry...

290
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,880
You never looked back.

291
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,070
You just looked straight ahead and kept walking.

292
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,310
I loved looking at your backs as you walked away.

293
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,410
You were all gruff, impudent and clumsy.

294
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,820
Yet you were all so kind and I loved you for that.

295
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,370
That's why... I...was so very happy.

296
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,350
To have been able to meet wonderful people like you.

297
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,850
To have had...a wonderful little brother like you...

298
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,450
So-chan...
