My sister, Otae, who works part-time at a snack shop met a man with a furry butt.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,790
If your boyfriend's rear end looked like an afro with a part down the middle, what would you do?

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,330
I would love him, butt afro and all.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,760

Let's go!

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,870
A fair...

10

...duel!

11

Hold on a second!

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,680
The blade! The t-t-tip!

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,130
Gin won with a cowardly trick you could hardly call "heroic".

[Odd Jobs Gin receives a new request... who is this old man?]

16
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,320
Vice Chief!

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,330
Is it true that the Chief was jilted by some chick?

18
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,320
Not only that, he got tricked into a duel and lost?!

19
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,210
Getting shot down by the ladies is nothing new for him, but I can't believe he lost a fight!

20
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,580
Just who is this silver-haired samurai?!

21

Pipe down, we're in a meeting.

22

Captain Okita...

25
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,250
...was announcing it over the loudspeaker.

26
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,350
I heard it from you, Hijikata.

Don't worry, Chief. We'll find him without fail!

All right, let's go!

46
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,530
Right!

47
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,500
They don't get it.

48
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,990
Do they actually think they can beat someone who challenged Kondo?

49
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,250
Now get this!

50

It's just one opponent!

51

Find him!

For the honor of the Shinsengumi!

53

Our target is...a silver-haired samurai!

54

Hey, hey, hey!

55
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,810
You don't plan on beating me, do you?

56
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,110
Not only is that reckless, it borders on arrogance, no, insolence.

57
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,340
Enough to make me belch.

58
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,330
If you plan on fighting, put your life on the line.

59
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,760
I'll make it so you'll never belch again.

60
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,960
We're not so lame that we'll succumb to just your fighting spirit.

61
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,940
This fight isn't about belching, it's about brains.

62
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,550
Never mind belching. Just get on with it!

63

Good evening, everyone. I'm Shinpachi Shimura.

Everyday, the trees turn greener.

65
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,670
By the way, the reason why we're scowling at each other like this is...

66
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,570
Well, it's complicated.

Yo! I'm Goku!

Hey, everyone! The great space war has begun!

69
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,720
I don't know about the difficult stuff, but I'm really shocked.

70

72

That's pretty bad acting, numbskulls.

73

Leave us alone. This is strategy!

74

How rude! Calling it bad acting.

77
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,270
So shouted Gintoki in his heart.

78
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,300
Shouted? Gin, don't copy me!

79
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,020
Dumbass! As if we can lose something like this.

80
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,350
Right. This is one match we cannot lose.

81
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,510

85

But a client shattered the peace.

86
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,110
He was a carpenter and advisor of the Kabukicho Town Council,

87

Ishida Pierre Genpachisayuemon.

90
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,090
His request was for a carpenter's assistant.

91
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,620
However, the request had a frightening catch to it.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,970
He only wants one person.

93
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,600
Just one of them would work!

94
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,990

A high-level negotiation going back and forth, voices and hands going non-stop.

This is Rock, Paper, Scissors!

114
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,710
And what's up with showing your hand early?!

115
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,980
The early hand is victorious!

116

Didn't I just say, rock was first?

In my family, this is rock.

Oh man! What? Excuses?

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,220
Quit bitching! Haul these supplies to the site.

164
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,870
There's the silver-haired samurai!

165
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,990
There you are, silver-haired samurai!

166
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
Th-This is...

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,730
A samurai eating white rice?!

168
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,300
Seconds!

169
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,230
There's no rice for samurai like you!

170
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,240
Found him! It's the silver-haired samurai!

171
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,100
Gotcha! Silver-haired samurai!

172
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,580
H-He's...

173
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,760
...a samurai getting a haircut?!

174
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,950
How would you like it cut?

175
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,430
Just trim it.

176
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,990
Just shave it all off!

177
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,290
Just get with it. There's a mountain of work to be done.

178
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,450
You don't get it, do you?

179
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,820
When you employ people, you have to inspire them, make them soar. You know?

180
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,580
Fine, soar as high as you like and make sure you don't fall. Here.

181
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,110
What?!

182
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,610
They've put signs up all over Edo and now the whole town knows about Kondo's loss?

183
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,830
Yeah, they're going hog wild posting it up.

184
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,220
And for all that, they haven't gotten any results.

185
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,590
Those morons!

186
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,540
What's the sense in telling the whole world your chief lost a duel?

187
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,070
What do you want to do?

188
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:31,550
If we don't do anything, the whole town will be inconvenienced and the reputation of the Shinsengumi will be in the mud.

189
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,240
Let's go, Sogo.

190
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,210
Go where?

191
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,350
What? Kill him?

192
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,710
Yeah, I'm gonna kill 'em.

193
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,020
You talking about the silver-haired samurai?

194
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,560
Yeah, I'll finish him off before this mess gets any bigger.

195
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,270
Every other word you utter is "kill."

196
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,520
The lessons of history teach us that nothing good comes from assassination.

197
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,630
This isn't assassination.

198
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,320
I'll just walk right up to him and cut him down.

199
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,660
No need to go that far.

200
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,040
Just haul in any old white-haired dude and the troops'll forget all about it!

201
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,470
How about this one?

202
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,300
Here, hold this wooden sword, wouldja?

203
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,060
Pops, swing this wooden sword a few times and beat this guy's head in.

204
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,350
At first glance he's not very imposing, but take off his glases...

205
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,620
and..."wow" Hey look! It's Musashi!

206
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,240
What's the point of drawing him looking cool?!

207
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,020
You really want to kill that dude?

208
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,260
All we know is that he's got white hair.

209
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,830
He can't be just anyone if he beat Kondo.

210
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,670
I'll know who he is when I see him.

211
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,440
Yeah, it's me.

212
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,410
Really? Got it.

213
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,650
Found him?

214
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,640
Yamazaki found someone who seems to be him.

215
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,250
Let's go.

216
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,090
This is the place.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,630
Shinsengumi! We have government business!

218
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,010
What is your business?

219
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,090
This is...

220
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,040
...a really...poor samurai?!

221
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,850
The only part that's right is "samurai"!

222
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,740
Commit seppuku this minute!

223
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,620
A silver-haired samurai.

224
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,870
I wonder where he could be?

225
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,170
You dirtbag! Put your soul into that hammer!

226
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,760
If this was your head, I'd put my soul into the hammer, baldy.

227
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,240
Shut up, you jerk!

228
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,870
Don't talk like you know it all, damned wavy-silver-haired mophead!

229
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,940
Can't find him. I think you don't have enough clues yet.

230
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,570
Why don't we go back? "Ladies 4" is gonna start.

231
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,360
When'd they switch? There's been a drama rerun at four.

232
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,210
Oh, really?

233
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,120
But hey, that drama's supposed to have a happy ending.

234
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,630
You too, huh?

235
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,700
You laugh on the outside, but you're crying on the inside, huh?

236
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,800
I wonder.

237
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,040
You haven't forgotten, have you?

238
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,830
Back in the old samurai country, the one who pulled us out of that humdrum life

239
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,050
was none other than Kondo.

240
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,630
We, the Shinsengumi, can walk around town with our heads held high

241
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,580
because of that man.

242
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,720
We decided to follow him.

243
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,480
Isn't that right, Sogo?

244
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,710
So, Sadomaru III. The target is the butt.

245
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,660
Hey, are you listening?!

246
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,130
Dammit!

247
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,930
Hey, watch it, bro.

248
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,270
H-Hey, that's dangerous!

249
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,940
I said, watch it.

250
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,940
Say it with more emotion then! Got it?

251
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,820
Oh, shut your hole.

252
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,850
Like I'm supposed to listen to a stranger coach me on dramatic delivery!

253
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,300
It's... you! The guy from that time at Ikedaya...

254
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,510
It's... you! The guy from that time at Ikedaya...

255
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,160
Oh yeah, I forgot...

256
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,220
you've got silver hair.

257
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,870
Umm, who are you?

258
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,520
Is that you, Ogushi? Man, you're looking so important.

259
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,540
What's up? Your pet gold fish ever get any bigger?

260
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,590
Hey, Gin! Hurry up, will ya!

261
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,130
Be right up!  'scuse me, Ogushi.  Gotta get back to work.

262
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,180
He took off!

263
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,500
Whatcha gonna do about it, Ogushi?

264
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,240
Who you callin' Ogushi?

265
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,720
That jerk! He forgets me after just three or four episodes!

266
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,970
Well, I think most would.

267
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,930
Sogo, lend me your sword.

268
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,080
Dammit...

269
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,950
If I have to work all day with this baldy, I'll go bald!

270
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,490
Sheesh! If help weren't so hard to find, I'd never have gone to your place!

271
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Don't screw that up, y'hear?

272
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,950
Same to you, baldy.

273
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,420
First bomb disposal, now roof repair?

274
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,920
You've got no self-respect at all, do you?

275
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,640
What's your story anyway?

276
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,990
Bomb?

277
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,920
You were there too, huh?

278
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,460
Finally remembered, eh?

279
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,600
There's no one even in the Shinsengumi who's that crazy.

280
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,470
I thought Kondo was invincible

281
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,510
but if it's you, it's a little more believable.

282
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,170
Kondo?

283
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,260
You two fought over a woman, remember?

284
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,670
Is she worth it?

285
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,660
Introduce me to her, will ya?

286
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,730
Hey...the tip...!

287
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,420
You're friends with gorilla-butt?

288
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,110
What are you coming after me for?

289
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,540
What's the big idea?!

290
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,990
He may be a gorilla, but to us, he's our beloved general!

291
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,830
He built the Shinsengumi up from nothing with just one sword.

292
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,570
He's my brother-in-arms!

293
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,600
I won't let anyone shame our unit...

294
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,280
and who so ever crosses that line, my blade...

295
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,360
...shall taste his blood!

296
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,660
It's time for Ladies 4!

297
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,610
Quit...

298
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,830
...swinging that sword around!

299
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,610
Nuohh!

300
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,450
Huh? What's going on?

301
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,520
Hey, Gin! You don't get paid if you're just playing around!

302
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,170
Shut up, baldy! Call the police! The police!

303
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,660
I am the police.

304
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,360
Huh? Oh yeah. Man, this world is coming to an end.

305
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,890
Heh, you're so right.

306
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,550
I can't figure this guy out.

307
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,640
I heard he used a dirty trick against Kondo,

308
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,180
but he's not doing anything like that now.

309
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,220
Far from it... he's not even defending himself with the sword I gave him.

310
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,950
Could it be that, even though his life's in danger... he's trying to be chivalrous?

311
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,160
Damn!

312
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,090
Draw that sword!

313
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,910
Killing a guy who won't fight back'll leave a bad taste in my mouth!

314
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,730
Hurry up! Draw!

315
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,110
All right, he's finally getting down to business.

316
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,940
Your life or mine!

317
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,100
Got him!

318
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,810
What?!

319
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,550
Parried! He got me.

320
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,640
Okay, fight's over.

321
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,890
Hey, baldy! I'm gonna take some sick leave!

322
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,650
Hold it!

323
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,350
You took mercy on me?

324
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,630
Mercy?

325
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,730
If I had any of that, I'd put it on my rice and eat it.

326
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,420
You fight when you have something to protect.

327
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,360
Like you tried to protect the Shinsengumi.

328
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,150
Protect?

329
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,910
Then what did you protect?

330
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,960
My own rules.

331
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,290
See ya.

332
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,790
That guy's a trip.

333
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,160
Wouldn't mind crossing swords with him myself.

334
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,480
Forget it. Even you would have a tough time of it, Sogo.

335
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,830
He may point his blade at you,

336
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,070
but he's fighting on some other plane.

337
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,250
It's beyond winning and losing for him, beyond right and wrong.

338
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,080
Sorry, Kondo. He beat me, too.

339
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,040
[Up next: Please Teach Us, Ginpachi Sensei]

340
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,770
Ginpachi Sensei after these messages!

341
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:16,900
[Preview]

342
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,260
What is this?!

343
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,830
Kagura, if you're gonna pick up strays, pick up something we recognize the name of!

344
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,430
Huh? You're gonna keep it? No way!

345
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,310
Mom'll never allow it!

346
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,660
The next episode:

347
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,610
"Eat Something Sour When You're Tired"

348
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,080
[Prince Baka... Hata from Midland Star is back again.]

349
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,090
[And this guy with dilated pupils, who was ordered to find a unique pet?]

350
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,360
[Please Teach Us, Ginpachi Sensei]

351
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,360
Please teach us, Ginpachi Sensei!

352
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,320
Here's a question from "Go back to Ehime, Onishi."

353
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,220
"There's something I've been wondering about..."

354
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,060
"What," you ask?

355
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,870
Well, Shinpachi said...

356
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:51,340
"The anti-foreigner faction tried to drive out the Amanto when they invaded twenty years ago."

357
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:59,550
"In other words, Gin and Katsura must be way past their thirties now, right?"

358
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,590
Fine. Now listen up, because this will be on the test.

359
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,570
The Joi War didn't end in just one year or so.

360
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:15,980
When the Amanto came to Earth twenty years ago, Gin was still a little kid with no hair on his privates.

361
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,460
The government got scared and were forced to open the country to the Amanto.

362
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:23,890
And throughout the land, samurai fought back but got their asses kicked.

363
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,180
At that point, Gin's pubic hair began to grow.

364
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:33,480
Eventually, the Amanto infiltrated even the government and had their way.

365
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,380
And it is during this time that Gin began his romp.

366
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,850
No, I don't mean like that.

367
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,470
And that basically sums up the several decades of the samurai struggle known as

368
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,290
the "Anti-Foreigner War."

369
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,650
Gin and the others got involved during the latter part of this period.

370
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,500
In conclusion, Onishi, you go out and stand in the hallway and think about that.
