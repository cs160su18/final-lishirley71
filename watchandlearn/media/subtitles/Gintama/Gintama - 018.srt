00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,550
Protecting your sister's panties is also our mission.

163
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,350
Boy, when it comes to making stupid excuses, our commander is the best.

164
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,610
Hey!

165
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,980
By the way, what is the Shinsengumi doing here?

166
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,710
For revenge...

167
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,450
Right, Hijikata-san?

168
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,120
What an idiot to give Hijikata-san charity panties.

169
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,110
No mercy!

170
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,400
His eyes are totally serious!

171
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,670
Buh-Bump! Mission: Capture Masked Loincloth using full of women.

172
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,670
[Buh-Bump! Mission: Capture Masked Loincloth using full of women.]

173
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,430
Yeah!

174
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,340
What do you mean by "full of women"?!

175
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,470
Well, let's get started again.

176
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,820
This time, we've decided to use a decoy operation with the full cooperation of Miss Tae Shimura.

177
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,180
Decoy operation?

178
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,890
Oh!

179
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,670
I'll offer my lucky panties. It'll knock you out like Mickey Rourke's Cat Punch.

180
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,450
Cat Punch!

181
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,350
Hold on! That's too hardcore!

182
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,020
Normal boys can't handle it. They'll run their ass off.

183
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,180
Then... How about this?

184
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,530
Oh...

185
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,040
Packs the same punch that knocked Akebono down.

186
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,330
Knocked...

187
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,510
No! No! No! That's way too maniacal!

188
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,900
Guys... Think a bit more about the brother who has to see his sister's panties over and over again, will ya?

189
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,600
It's worse than watching a love scene on TV with your whole family.

190
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,790
And that's how a boy climbs up the ladder to adulthood.

191
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,890
You there! Don't summarize it so easily!

192
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,340
Watching your sister's panties is nothing!

193
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,990
Hijikata-san saw his father wearing a bra.

194
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,770
I see. It was so shocking that his pupils are still wide open to this day.

195
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,470
Like hell they are!

196
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,300
I'm risking my life and my panties here!

197
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,440
Stop messing around and get to work, you idiots!

198
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,420
Y-Yes, ma'am.

199
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,480
Big sis, you're so cool!

200
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,220
Listen up!

201
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,600
He is a genuine pervert who prefers quality over quantity when it comes to girls' panties.

202
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,470
Therefore he'll definitely sneak in here again.

203
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,750
And that's when we capture him.

204
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,880
I don't care if he's the Mask Loincloth or Masked Panty thief,

205
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,710
we cannot forgive the way he tramples over a girl's innocence and a man's pride.

206
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,120
All pumped up and ready to kick some ass, we'll bring him down with a single blow!

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,950
We'll stain his white briefs red with his own blood!

208
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,790
Yeah!

209
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,460
Excuse me?!

210
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,630
Aren't you all becoming a bit too psychotic over a panty thief?

211
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,810
I mean...Do we really need the Shinsengumi for this?

212
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,140
What are you saying?! Even I can...

213
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,390
Ouch!

214
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,550
Now, now...

215
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,240
I thought something like this would happen,

216
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,970
so I brought these from the warehouse in the castle.

217
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,150
What's this?

218
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,180
How should I put it?

219
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,490
Something like...land mines?

220
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,830
Not "something like"! That's exactly what it is!

221
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,620
I had a hard time sneaking them out under strict supervision.

222
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,330
"Takes a thief to catch a thief", eh?

223
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,920
Just like that?!

224
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,100
Place these mines in the surrounding area,

225
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,600
and this old dojo will become an invincible and secure fort.

226
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,290
It can stay as an old dojo!

227
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,250
It's illegal! It's totally against the Geneva Convention!

228
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,190
That's that. We have our own rules.

229
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,290
Don't talk like some mom would!

230
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,210
A land mine is a weapon of war!

231
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,890
No, it's not.

232
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,590
The official name is "Something like...a land mine."

233
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,470
You're kidding me!

234
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,450
Shin-chan.

235
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,200
This is a battlefield. If you're scared, go home, little girl.

236
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,580
But, sis... This is my home.

237
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,660
It takes a real samurai to embrace the battlefield as their home.

238
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,710
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.

239
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,820
Accusing someone as suspicious and killing them without argument.

240
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,180
I haven't done this for a long time.

241
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,270
Huh? Huh? Accuse?

242
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,170
Whoa!

243
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,740
No...We might as well pierce through them.

244
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,920
Pounding them is much better than that...

245
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,190
How about we tear them up and pluck them out?

246
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,120
Twisting, breaking, rolling and boiling?

247
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,690
Hey, hey! You two are scaring us!

248
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,130
Ouch...

249
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,720
My back hurts.

250
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
It's not like working on a farm!

251
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,810
It's the most dangerous construction work in the world!

252
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,230
Quit being annoying, Yamazaki!

253
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,020
How come I always get...

254
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,740
It's because your blood is so sweet.

255
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,820
My blood sugar level...?

256
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,510
We don't care about your blood glucose...

257
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,430
I don't see any signs of the thief appearing.

258
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,690
Perhaps he won't come at all. I mean, not only today, but never!

259
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,900
Don't worry, he'll come.

260
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,470
What's your reasoning for that?

261
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,470
Look at those panties just hanging out in the open like that.

262
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,080
What panty thief could resist it?!

263
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,910
But it's too obvious! You can tell it's a trap!

264
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,080
Shin-chan.

265
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,420
The more difficult the task, the more encouraged the thief gets.

266
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,730
How the heck would you know?!

267
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,090
What if he's a wussy thief?

268
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:20,220
I don't care who the thief is. Let's just grab someone and say he's the thief.

269
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,450
If we can agree on a story, it'll work.

270
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,230
Someone as in who?! Agreeing on what?!

271
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,970
Hey, stop yelling.

272
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,040
If the crook hears you, it'll ruin the surprise.

273
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,350
What's ruined is your brains! And it's freakin' hot, damn it!

274
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,040
What did you say, you bastard?!

275
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,580
How 'bout I ventilate your face!

276
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,690
Hey, don't push me. It's too hot!

277
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,720
If you think I'm gonna even let you, then you're wrong!

278
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,370
Should we help them out?

279
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,610
When you fight, give it your all.

280
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,420
Go until your opponent can't stand up.

281
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,280
My fist wants to fight too!

282
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,090
Somebody! Let my fists taste your blood!

283
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,740
Hey, stop! No fighting!

284
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,950
You guys are just getting testy because of the heat.

285
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,510
All right, let's take a break.

286
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,720
Shut up, mite beards!

287
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,770
Shut up, ass hair!

288
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,170
Shut up, Mr. Tangle.

289
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,410
Shut up, miso bread.

290
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,690
Shut up, Gorilla.

291
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,450
It's just the heat, right? That's gotta be it.

292
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,660
Oh, why don't I get something cold? It'll help calm everyone down.

293
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,160
Azuki bean ice cream!

294
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,390
Something sundae-like!

295
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,630
Baagen-Daaz ice cream!

296
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,730
Seafood vinaigrette!

297
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,660
Beef bowl and tonjiru bento!

298
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,300
With a 500 ml bottle of Mayonnaise on the side!

299
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,400
G-Green tea.

300
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,370
Alright, already. I'll get them, just chill out.

301
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,070
Good grief...

302
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,500
Oh, Kondo-san blew up!

303
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,140
Well, it was hot after all.

304
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,890
I guess that would blow you away.

305
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,830
Yeah right! He stepped on his own land mine.

306
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,860
He didn't remember where he placed it, what an idiot!

307
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,900
Uh... wait a sec, guys...

308
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,700
Don't tell me you all don't remember where you set up the land mines?

309
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,600
Oh dear! The mailman will get blown to bits tomorrow morning.

310
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,060
Now isn't the time to say that!

311
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,250
Th-That man...

312
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,650
Where there's light, there is shadow.

313
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,780
Where there's men, there is a baldie.

314
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,650
Pulled by the elastic bands of panties,

315
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,290
Tonight, I run the path of men's dreams!

316
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,700
Masked Loincloth Bandit, at your service!

317
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,400
Hysterical! You guys are priceless!

318
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,300
It appears you've prepared a warm welcoming for me, but it's all in vain!

319
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,770
This sucks! He came at the worst possible moment!

320
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,090
Did you really think I'd fall for such childish tricks?

321
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,780
You've underestimated the Masked Loincloth, the greatest bandit!

322
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,680
If you come up here, I'd fight you!

323
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,280
You can bite your fingernails and watch

324
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:01,230
as your panties are handed over to perverts, otakus, cherryboys, and delusional horny S.O.B.'s!

325
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,360
Here I come!

326
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,970
It's what you'd call, "taking extra measures".

327
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,150
Go, Yamazaki! Beat'em up!

328
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,780
You got it, Vice-commander!

329
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,150
Die!

330
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,600
What the hell did he show up for?!

331
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,880
Silly Shinsengumi. Tah!

332
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,230
There was a land mine placed under the floor too, huh?

333
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,920
Yup, looks that way...

334
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,360
Hey! That's...

335
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,510
You fools!

336
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,840
You can't defeat me with something like this.

337
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,720
Perverts, otakus, cherryboys, and delusional horny S.O.B.'s across the country await my return!

338
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,840
Their voices give me power!

339
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,670
Can't you hear their voices?

340
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,350
"Masked Loincloth, please! Give us hope!"

341
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,080
"Rough nylon, smooth silk, fluffy cotton.

342
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,220
Anything is fine! Just one pair of panties is enough for us to live another day."

343
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,600
"Then we can stand tall and keep going!"

344
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,300
Can you hear their silent cries?!

345
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,970
Failure is not an option!

346
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,460
In the Masked Loincloth's honor, I will to return to them!

347
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,960
Wait!

348
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,870
Keep your filthy paws off of Otae-san's panties!

349
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,920
I haven't even touched them yet, damn it!

350
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,630
Kuh, let me go! You gorilla with a butt-hair chin three seconds short of a man!

351
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,700
You think such descriptive abuse would make me flinch?!

352
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,630
Odd Jobs! What are you waiting for?! Hurry, I'll let you have this one!

353
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,570
No need to tell me.

354
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,810
Hold on tight to his hairy legs!

355
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,030
It looks like I get the last laugh, after all!

356
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,210
Never underestimate...

357
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,810
What?!

358
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,080
...a woman!

359
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,770
There's no way I'll give my panties to someone who won't even show his face.

360
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,280
If you really want it, approach me directly, naked from head to toe.

361
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,910
I mean...with an open naked heart.

362
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,290
In this right hand, I have not a single pair of panties!

363
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,410
Sis!

364
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,670
Big sis, you're the best!

365
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,940
Hijikata-san, actually, I gave you the charity panties.

366
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,990
What?!

367
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,920
Ha ha! It was a joke. A joke!

368
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,980
You wanna die?

369
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,180
Wait!

370
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,120
Stay there!

371
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,270
The beach? No can do.

373
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,460
Looks like the beach is closed off because of a man-eating alien.

374
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,200
What? There's a reward for that alien?

375
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,610
All right! This summer is going to be fly fishing for aliens!
