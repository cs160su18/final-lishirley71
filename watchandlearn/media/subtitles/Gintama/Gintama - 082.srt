[Today we're kinda doing two stories for GinTama. The first story is about defeating the "Orochin" monster.]

3
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,140
[The second story is about Hammy's request. Actually, do you even remember who Hammy is?]

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,630
Gin-san... What is this?

9
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,350
What do you mean?

10
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,590
It's lunch, of course.

11
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,540
No...that's not what I meant.

12
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,490
No matter how you look at it, this is just bread and rice, right?

13
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,800
Well, obviously.

14
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,670
Does this look like fish and chips to you?

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,790
Yeah, but eating bread with rice is just weird!

16
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,900
Are we like carb fanatics or something?!

17
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,480
You know, carbohydrates make people happy.

18
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,260
That's why we have ramen rice and chikara udon.

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,260
[Note: Chikara udon is udon noodles with sticky rice cakes.]

20
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,360
Our ancestors were the ones who recklessly combined carbohydrates into a meal,

21
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,920
and made it our country's tradition.

22
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,230
Yeah, we haven't been getting many jobs lately.

23
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,520
If we don't do something quick, we may have to keep eating like this.

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,330
Yeah, I know we gotta do something,

25
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,760
but there aren't that many opportunities to make money, you know.

26
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,960
Money making opportunities and true love are hard to come by.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,440
Next up, a story on getting rich quick.

28
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,180
Huh?

29
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,180
Let's turn it over to Ketsuno-san!

30
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,440

Yes, this is Ketsuno reporting live.

32

Yamata, a tranquil village rich in nature, has recently been plagued by depopulation.

33
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,290
To make matters worse...

34
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,130
...the village has also come under attack by a mysterious monster.

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,990
I beg you, please help our village.

36
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,420
[Note: Yamata (the village) + Orochin (the monster) is a wordplay of Yamatano Orochi, an eight-headed snake folklore monster.]

37
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,420
Any brave warriors who can defeat Orochin and the monsters living in that mountain...

38
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,350
...wilI be rewarded with our village's treasure...this golden radish.

39
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,250
Golden?!

40
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,070
Radish!!

41
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,490
Brave warriors, please help us!

["You Don't Stand in Line for the Ramen, You Stand in Line for the Self Satisfaction"]

43
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,410
Go home!!

44
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,660
I will not allow you to step foot into this village!

45
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,840
If outsiders like you came into our village,

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,020
you'd eat all the food from our fields, destroy our land and litter all over.

47
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,640
You'd destroy our village's happiness!

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,310
That's why as long as I live, I will never let you in!

49
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,740
Now hurry up and go home!

50
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,990
We traveled all the way out here, you think we're gonna go home empty handed?

51
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,590
Shut up!

52
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,380
Stop whining and get outta here!

53
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,690
Go away!

54
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,690
Go home!

55
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,450
Jeez, I'm outta here.

56
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,240
What am I supposed to tell my wife?

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,070
Gin-san, what are we gonna do?

58
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,370
Well, we have no choice but to go home.

59
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,570
Chief!

60
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,110
We did it again!

61
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,360
Take a look!

62
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,820
You've got plenty.

63
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,930
Who knew these monsters would turn into gold once they were defeated?

64
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,100
Why should we give our good fortune to outsiders?

65
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,980
Oh yeah, now I see why you wanted to drive away the brave warriors.

66
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,490
Wh-What?

67
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,870
Y-Y-You were listening to what I just said?

68
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,070
Yes, we were!

69
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,840
Forget everything!

70
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,270
Forget it right now!

71
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,310
Erase every single thing from your memory!

72
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,190
Impossible.

73
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,390
You think anyone can really do that?

74
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,240
But more importantly, why suddenly...

75
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,860
What's with this thing?

76
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,630
Move.

77
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,760
Out of our way.

78
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,140
Th-This is...

79
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,100
Kintama!

80
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:35,080
[Note: "Kintama" literally means "golden ball," but is also a slang for testicles.]

81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,110
Kagura-chan, girls shouldn't say that word.

82
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,860
Okay then, how about golden ball?

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,080
That's right, girls shouldn't talk like that.

84
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,420
That's not good either.

85
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,380
But in any case, with this gold we no longer have to eat rice with bread.

86
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,550
Geez, dream a little bigger, will'ya?

87
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,170
Ouch!

88
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,810
If we have all of this then...

89
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,350
I'll take all the strawberry milk you've got!

90
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,840
Oh, come on. Think bigger than that!

91
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,110
If it were me...

92
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,900
I'll take all the pickled seaweed and plum-flavored pickled seaweed.

93
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,130
All you did was add another item! That's all!

94
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,510
Y-You guys, hurry up and save me.

95
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,230
If it's that big...

96
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,060
...then the "kintama" will be even bigger!

97
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,060
I said...

98
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,480
...girls should not say that word, okay?

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,430
Amazing!

100
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,690
They took down a monster that big in an instant.

101
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,260
Many thanks for your trouble.

102
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,130
Come closer so I can praise you.

103
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,040
Gin-san, looks like we can say farewell to our days of eating rice and bread.

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,890
Hey, you guys.

105
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,720
What are you talking about?

106
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,520
I am trying to give you some words of gratitude.

107
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,420
If we have this much money, we can splurge on a lot more.

108
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,560
Come closer.

109
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,390
Hey, shut up, Prince Hata...I mean Prince Baka.

110
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,610
You got my name right and then you corrected yourself?

111
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,720
You talking about bread and rice?

112
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,140
Stop thinking so small, you commoner!

113
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,530
Not only that, you paused for effect?

114
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,560
Shut up, you idiot!

115
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,050
Bread with rice?

116
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,850
Jeez, calling me an idiot every single time.

117
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,850
That's why I don't like commoners.

118
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,110
Everyone knows real luxury is when you can eat two bottles

119
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,110
Is it really that much fun getting my name wrong?

120
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,860
of sweetened seaweed preserves with rice and one bottle with bread!

121
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,310
Is it?

122
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,860
You low class monkeys!

123
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,580
Die, you idiot!

124
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,000
That's luxury?

125
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,590
I'm not going to take this from you.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,260
Having sweetened seaweed preserves isn't much of a difference.

127
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,490
I won't!

128
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,390
All right, let's hunt, hunt, hunt like crazy so we can indulge in every possible luxury!!

129
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,540
Yeah!

130
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,540
Hunt, hunt, hunt like crazy!!

131
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,300
Oh excuse me, you people over there, I have a question.

132
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,970
Is there something called an Orochin around here?

133
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,260
Dammit!!

134
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,520
If they're going to hunt with such vigor they'll end up taking everything we own!

135
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,840
Hey, secretary!

136
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,040
By the authority vested in me as the village chief, I declare a level one emergency.

137
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,260
Yes, sir.

138
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,150
I make a rare appearance and this is how I get treated?

139
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,130
I might as well transfer over to D. Gray-man.

140
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,130
[Note: D.Gray-man is another Shonen Jump manga.]

141
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,160
What the heck is this?

142
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,230
Yeah, these buildings look out of place.

143
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,410
It doesn't look that different from Kabukicho.

[Note: Sign in background says: "The civic hall of happiness."]

148
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,050
What's with this forced feeling of happiness?

149
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,360
Yeah, it's so happy that it's actually spooky.

150
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,030
This is what you call the product of public enterprise.

151
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,720
Do you think happiness can be achieved from this, Gin-chan?

152
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,260
Happiness depends on each person.

153
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,330
If you think you're happy, then you must be happy.

154
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,540
But in any case, with all these buildings, it'll be hard to find monsters.

Hunt down Orochin!

209
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,060
Then we will still get more golden balls!

Everyone, hunt down Orochin!

He's right.

If we kill Orochin, we'll get even more golden balls.

He's right, let's hunt down Orochin!

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,070
Secretary... What just happened?

228
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,670
That was a fake Orochin.

229
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,020
The real Orochin is me.

230
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,530
In order for me to take on my true form as Orochin,

231
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,110
I needed the power of people's endless greed.

232
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,650
To get that, I let loose monsters in your village

233
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,500
and I planned it so you can get gold when you kill them.

234
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,570
If that was the case, why even have monsters in the first place?

235
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,700
It wouldn't have been as fun now, would it?

236
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,640
It's like even if a noodle shop sells the best tasting noodles,

237
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,990
who would want to go there if there wasn't a line to get in?

238
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,990
I guess...that's true.

239

There is one thing I must apologize for.

00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,130
but the organization is now after him too.

323
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,930
In any case, he's in totally deep poop.

324
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,270
That's why I'm here to ask for your help.

325
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,390
Hurry up and find him! Come on!

326
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,790
Where the hell is he?!

327
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,980
Crap! I'm in deep poop!

328
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,750
What the heck is Kimiko doing?

329
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,370
Hmm... So you're planning on leaving the organization

330
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,610
to go live happily ever after with this Kimiko-chan?

331
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,390
Who the hell is Kimiko?

332
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,860
Is she your woman?

333
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,060
Well, isn't that nice, Tasuke.

334
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,240
W-Wait.

335
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,290
Let me go!

336
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,990
I don't wanna do this kind of risky stuff anymore.

337
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,670
I want to live a decent life.

338
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,310
Decent?

339
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,940
That's funny coming from a thief like you!

340
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,550
We don't give a damn about you!

341
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,550
We just want the stuff!

342
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,340
We're not gonna let you just taste the good stuff and then run away.

343
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,080
Where did you hide it?

344
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,570
You'd better tell us quick or else...

345
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,880
W-Wait.

346
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,020
I really don't...

347
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,200
This is what's gonna happen!

348
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,260
You can still talk, right?

349
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,630
Okay, next I'll cut here. Right here!

350
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,620
Wait!

351
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,270
I really don't know anything.

352
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,370
Seriously, I don't have it.

353
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,370
Then, die!

354
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,010
Who the hell are you?

355
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,250
Who the hell am I?

356
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,670
[Note: Spoof of Strange Old Man character by Ken Shimura.]

357
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,090
Yeah, you got it.

358
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,670
I'm-

359
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,040
Tasuke!

360
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,120
Kimiko!

361
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,550
Everything's okay now.

362
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,250
I brought the Odd Jobs guy with me.

363
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,430
These guys will do anything as long as you pay them.

364
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,920
Do anything?

365
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,670
Looks like he can't even stand up.

366
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,460
You sure about this?

367
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,740
Ow... She ruined it.

368
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,380
Hey, change of plans.

369
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,960
We're gonna leave these guys and retreat.

370
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,260
Aye aye, sir.

371
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,210
Hey!

372
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,990
What the hell are you doing escaping alone?!

373
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,910
Sorry but I never had plans to escape with two pigs on my back.

374
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,870
What the hell?!

375
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,310
Do you know how many parfaits I treated you to?

376
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,780
You'd better work for them!

377
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,890
My-My stomach's getting squished...

378
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,740
Oh crap, this is bad.

379
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,490
It's gonna come out! I'm telling you my internal organs are gonna burst out.

380
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,260
Your internal organs?

381
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,740
No, Gin-chan!!

382
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,110
If something like that comes out, I'll never be able to get the image out of my head!

383
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,870
It'll ruin our friendship!

384
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,390
Like that would really happen!

385
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,050
Shinpachi, take the rope.

386
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,270
Hey, hang on.

387
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,570
Hamko!

388
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,040
Let go of Gin-chan or else his internal organs will pop out!

389
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,880
Hey...what are you doing? You're seriously pissing me off!

390
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,730
Speaking of which, you get off me too...

391
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,650
Ah!!

392
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,050
It came out!!

393
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,360
Something came out of my ass!!

394
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,110
Shinpachi!

395
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,820
Take a look for me.

396
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,890
Did something come out? Did it?

397
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,400
How would I know?

398
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,270
I can't hold it anymore!

399
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,360
Gin-san!

400
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,560
Oh no, get outta there quick!

401
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,400
When you get down to it, this suits us the best.

402
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,380
Follow me, guys.

403
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,960
We're gonna bulldoze our way through!!

404
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,160
Outta my way!

405
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,110
You can totally kick ass!

406
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,520
Oh, I think I'm falling for you.

407
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,390
No, seriously, that's bad. Don't do that.

408
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,010
Besides, what's all this?

409
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,080
What's going on?

410
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,970
Pretty big going away party for one little punk, eh?!

411
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,160
Something fishy is going on with pube head over there!

412
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
What?

413
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,790
Are you saying Tasuke might have done something bad?

414
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,930
No way!

415
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,770
I decided to live a decent life with Kimiko!

416
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,900
And I ain't no pube head.

417
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,400
This is a fashionable wig.

418
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,500
Don't dis my wig!

419
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,010
Hey...

420
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,510
You really should remember where you hide your stuff.

421
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,550
It's the "Paradise!"

422
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,760
So that's where the bastard was hiding it.

423
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,450
Grab it!

424
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,720
...Tasuke...

425
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,750
You...stole "Paradise" from the gang, didn't you?

426
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,740
Why?

427
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,800
You said you were gonna quit!

428
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,990
You said we'd live a decent life together!

429
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,870
Tasuke... How about we make a deal?

430
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,840
You can have her back in exchange for the drugs you stole.

431
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,430
Hand it over now and I'll let you go too.

432
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,890
Don't listen to him.

433
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,190
He's going to kill you!

434
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,280
Forget about me. Hurry and run-

435
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,440
That didn't take you long to decide!

436
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,740
And you run so fast?!

437
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,940
Do whatever you want to her!

438
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,290
Later, Kimiko! Nice knowing you!

439
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,250
I only went out with you 'cause I thought you were rich.

440
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,020
Otherwise who would wanna go out with a pig like you?

441
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,060
In the end, this world is all about...

442
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,190
...money.

443
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,840
You Amanto who prey on humans.

444
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,100
And you pathetic humans who wag your tails and lap up the crumbs.

445
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,710
You're the pigs.

446
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,720
No way am I going to protect a miserable pig like him.

447

Whose side are you on, you bastard?!

448

Neither.

449

But never mind that. Here.

450
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,880
I'll trade you this for the ugly chick.

451
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,630
You hand it over first.

452
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,460
What are you afraid of?

453
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,950
He threw it!

454
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,680
Hey, somebody catch it!

455
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,400
Oh no, our precious "Paradise."

456
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,140
Scoop it up! Pick it up!

457
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,970
What the hell has he done?

458
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,640
Hey, that girl's gone too.

459
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,390
This is unbelievable.

460
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,660
I asked you to help Tasuke and look what happened.

461
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,770
You're the one who's unbelievable.

462
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,740
What are you gonna do with that mess?

463
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,140
Just to let you know, you can't eat that even if you grill it.

464

Are we going there again?

465
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,330
Is it because if you let him go you may never get a boyfriend again?

466
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,090
There are such things as miracles in this world, you know.

467
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,830
I don't need a pathetic miracle like that.

468
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,070
I'm probably the only one...

469
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,160
...who would go out with a loser like him.

470
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,010
What was that all about?

471
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,610
They look more like mother and son...

472
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,040
...than a couple.

473
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,490
If I had a mother like that, I'd turn to crime, too.
