00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,260
Well, I've got an important announcement from TV Tokyo.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,550
The current analog broadcast will be ending on July 24, 2011 and switching

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,910
to a terrestrial digital broadcast.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,810
Once that has happened, analog televisions will...

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,710
Gin-san.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,510
What?

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,520
They didn't ask for this today.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,920
Really?

10
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,580
Shuddap...

11
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,790
This Perowne stuff is good.

12
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,240
Can't deny that.

13
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,370
You'll take anything, huh?

14
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,210
After all these years of being called DORK,

15
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,770
Gin-san, I'm gonna do it.

16
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,270
A life that keeps sputtering on...

17
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,490
An endless loop of finding bad things on the other side...

18
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,080
I'm going to break free of this DORK Spiral today!

19
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,720
That's right.

20
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,400
All you need is a chance to turn your life around.

21
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,020
We'll be taking off from this place today.

22
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Let's go, Hasegawa-san.

23
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,540
Yeah!

24
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,500
Win, win, and win more!

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,900
No more DORK!

26
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,510
["The other side of the other side of the other side would be the other side."]

27
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,280
Horse racing is a mind game.

28
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,030
The result comes from a number of intertwined factors.

29
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,240
Quite frankly, anybody who doesn't use their head is an idiot.

30
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,260
I don't understand the nitty-gritty stuff,

31
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,810
but you just have to pick the winning horse, right?

32
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,540
Too naive.

33
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,530
There are notes about records, news, times, training, pedigrees, jockeys, trainers...

34
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,550
The wealth of information written here narrows down the choices.

35
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,880
Naturally, you can't take what's written at face value.

36
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,550
You have to read between the lines to spot the hidden signs and arrive at the only possible truth.

37
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,110
That's how you predict...

38
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,770
God, that's long!

39
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,400
That's a long-ass explanation!

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,650
I'm a beginner, so I don't understand all that crap.

41
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,570
So which horse has it coming? Which horse is it?

42
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,280
Like I was saying, the predicting is the epitome of horse racing!

43
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,680
If you think it's too much effort, just go with your gut!

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,100
There's always beginner's luck.

45
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,360
I see. Go with my gut...

46
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,780
Hey! What's that?!

47
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,620
The date?!

48
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,680
It wouldn't be so hard if you could win like that!

49
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,610
Don't worry.

50
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,420
Weren't you talking about beginner's luck just now?

51
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,660
The stars are aligned for me today.

52
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,790
I can see the star of victory shining above me.

53
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:06,630
Yeah, can't you see that shining star next to the Big Dipper?

54
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,570
No, you don't want to see that one.

55
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,790
People have died after seeing that.

56
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,730
That's odd...

57
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,560
I had a pretty good feeling this time...

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,730
That's odd...

59
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,760
I had a pretty good feeling this time...

60
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,380
Wait, you weren't even predicting anything.

61
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,170
You just went with the date.

62
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,610
You're one to talk.

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,500
Your ticket was completely wrong, too.

64
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
No, don't lump me together with you.

65
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,680
My prediction was on a whole different scale from yours.

66
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,300
I stayed up for seven hours last night simulating possible outcomes.

67
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,220
And that lead to this result.

68
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,400
Hey, don't you feel empty when you say that?

69
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,070
How much time are you wasting?

70
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,210
And yeah, didn't you have anything else to do?

71
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,540
I didn't.

72
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,040
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,980
W-Well, let's pull ourselves together and try another race, Hasegawa-san.

74
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,290
You're right.

75
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,750
We only lost one race.

76
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,810
The game's just begun!

77
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,900
That's right!

78
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,110
Go! Go!

79
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,220
That's it! Run your ass off!

80
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,700
The whip! Use the whip!

81
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,540
Lost everything...

82
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,590
Yeah...

83
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,700
Even had the hairs on my ass plucked off...

84
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,760
I don't even have enough for the train-ride back.

85
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,060
What's wrong?

86
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,760
Did you snap after losing so much.

87
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,380
Nah.

88
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,740
It just seems like this is how it's always been since we met.

89
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,770
Really?

90
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,380
'Cause you know, I may be like this now,

91
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,860
but before I met y'all, I was a top level bureaucrat in the Bakufu.

92
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,470
Weren't you ever taught to obey authority?

93
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,040
You're from the Bakufu?

94
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,070
We're from Immigration.

95
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,630
We've got a job for you, Odd Jobs.

96
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,840
I was shooting my way up the ladder...

97
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,330
Despite appearances...

98
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,250
But...

99
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,210
Gin-san!

100
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,140
Shinpachi!

101
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,880
I told you not to act arbitrarily!

102
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,650
It's gonna eat me!

103
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,650
Bastard...

104
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,540
I'm fully aware that we won't be able to capture it in one piece.

105
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,160
A little sacrifice is necessary for the stupid prince to understand that fact.

106
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey! Are you listening to me?!

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,220
So you want to use my sidekick as bait so you can get permission to dispose of that?

108
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,510
You people are rotten to the core.

109
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,960
Like I said, we have to learn to live with them.

110
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,080
Rotten or not, I'm protecting this country in my own way.

111
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,970
That's my kind of samurai code.

112
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,650
I see.

113
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,430
Then, I'll follow my own samurai code!

114
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,760
Wait up!

115
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,320
So what if the Bakufu or the country collapses?!

116
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:36,660
I'll live tall until the day this body falls apart!

117
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,210
That bastard's gone and done it.

118
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,520
Hasegawa, what is the meaning of this?!

119
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,450
I told you to capture him without hurting him!

120
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,170
This is an international issue!

121
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,480
Live tall...

122
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,420
Sounds like a goal a kid would set.

123
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,190
That's right. My mother used to say...

124
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,120
"You're hunched over. Stand up straight."

125
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,100
Mom, am I standing up straight right now?

126
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,020
-gawa!

127
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,200
Hasegawa!

128
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm going to report this incident to my father!

129
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,700
Shut it.

130
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,870
Shut it!

131
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,840
I told you to shut your mouth, you blob-headed alien!

132
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,650
That was where everything started going wrong.

133
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,270
Before that point, I was Taizo Hasegawa.

134
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,120
People called me by my real name.

135
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,600
But ever since...

136
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,030
Why were you fired, old-timer?

137
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,800
Well... Because...

138
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,420
It's because I lost my head once and just followed my bliss.

139
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,540
A young girl like you should always think about the consequences of your actions.

140
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,980
Life is long, you know.

141
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,820
I don't want to hear that from a loser like you.

142
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,950
See ya, you Dumb Old Retarded Kook!

143
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,880
Or "DORK" for short!

144
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,400
Yes...

145
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,420
I became DORK...

146
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,370
Hasegawa-san...

147
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,540
Let's go...

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,340
Our battle's over now...

149
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,520
Looking back, the two of us have never come out ahead when we gamble together.

150
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,430
When we play pachinko, we end up losing the money for the next day's meals...

151
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,960
When we go to the casino...

152
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,980
Everybody's ready?

153
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,520
Even!

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,450
We leave without the clothes on our backs.

155
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,700
Enough already...

156
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,440
Gin-san, today's different.

157
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,880
Tomorrow is Hatsu's birthday.

158
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,720
I see... Your wife's...

159
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,600
Even after everything that's happened,

160
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,790
I still want to look good for Hatsu.

161
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,750
Well, I at least want to be a husband who manages to scrape by,

162
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,910
despite being a failure.

163
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,940
That's what's kept me floundering around this whole time.

164
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,950
I worked my ass off to find a job.

165
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,860
I struggled in vain to escape this lifestyle.

166
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,100
But my efforts always ended in failure...

167
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,780
Is this the DORK Spiral?

168
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,520
Now, I don't even have a place to live, let alone a job.

169
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,630
Er, wait.

170
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,930
Looking back now, all of my failures were because of you guys...

171
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,090
It's just your imagination.

172
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,500
I talk to Hatsu every now and then on the phone,

173
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,440
but the trial was the last time I saw her in person.

174
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,270
Sorry.

175
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,310
He didn't wear the suit you prepared.

176
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,770
What a stubborn bastard.

177
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,700
Or no, what a stubborn couple.

178
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,120
You're perfect for each other in those dirty clothes.

179
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,550
Hatsu...

180
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,540
I will now deliver the committee's verdict.

181
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,880
The accused, Taizo Hasegawa,

182
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,290
is found guilty.

183
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,070
Of the crime of making his wife cry.

184
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,200
Go after her right away.

185
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,870
That's your sentence.

186
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,870
Magistrate!

187
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,630
As for D.A. Haga, we shall punish him accordingly once we've learned the details.

188
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,050
The DVDs in the possession of the accused have been deemed a dangerous substance,

189
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,620
so I shall take custody of them personally.

190
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,890
Why?!

191
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,870
How badly do you want to watch those DVDs?!

192
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,950
And so, this case is closed.

193
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,660
Hatsu!

194
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,090
Wait! Hold on!

195
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,350
I need to tell you something!

196
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,180
You did it, Hasegawa-san!

197
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,700
DORK! We'll get your compensation for you!

198
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,300
Hatsu!

199
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,620
I've made her suffer so much...

200
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,820
I want to at least buy her a present.

201
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,810
Makes you wanna laugh, right?

202
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,360
Go ahead.

203
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,370
Everything's fallen apart.

204
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,750
Thanks to the DORK Spiral, I have no job, no money... I have nothing left...

205
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,880
Still...

206
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,510
I can't back down.

207
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,380
You can go home, Gin-san.

208
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,280
I can't force you to stay here any longer.

209
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,990
But, I...

210
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,880
Go home?

211
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,740
Don't be ridiculous.

212
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm finally getting the hang of it.

213
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,690
Gin-san...

214
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,100
We're staying to the end.

215
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,690
I'll watch your battle all the way through.

216
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,820
I won't give up.

217
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,830
As long as there's a 1% chance...

218
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,660
As long as I still have my underwear...

219
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,710
I'll break free of this DORK Spiral, for Hatsu... For our future!

220
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,640
Whether you like it or not, this is the last shot.

221
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,940
Make sure you have no regrets.

222
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,120
Gin-san...

223
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,400
Hasegawa-san...

224
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,630
It's on!

225
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,590
Yes...

226
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,600
When gambling, the question is what you bet.

227
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,360
The cost varies depending on the risk.

228
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,630
The fleeting thrill of betting money and putting yourself on the line...

229
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,770
The ardor and frustration from empathizing with the horse and jockey...

230
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,380
Different people bet different things.

231
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,950
But I

232
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,260
will bet my life on this horse!

233
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,660
Everything on number 13 winning!

234
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,650
Gotcha.

235
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,700
300 yen on number 13.

236
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,100
Today's final race is made up of older horses with a ten million yen earnings limit.

237
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,610
The race will be 1800 meters on turf with all sixteen gates occupied.

238
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,580
The horses are entering their gates one by one without any incident.

239
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,360
I'm counting on you, Justaway...

240
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,610
I'm staking everything on your explosive speed!

241
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,240
Finally, Patek of Visa has entered its gate.

242
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,310
All horses in.

243
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,350
The race has begun.

244
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,880
A clean start.

245
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,310
The horses are now battling for position.

246
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,550
Who will have the early advantage?

247
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,700
In front, we have Arcade Humming.

248
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Cheap Impact is holding its position at third.

249
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,730
Bono Machan is in the middle of the pack.

250
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,740
Hatsu...

251
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,480
I have a feeling I can change if I win this race...

252
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,370
Hatsu!

253
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,020
Arcade Humming is still in front.

254
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,330
The trailers are slowly cutting down on his lead.

255
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,700
They've just turned the third corner and are on their way to the fourth.

256
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,440
No, I have to change...

257
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,030
For Hatsu's sake, I have to win! Win and change!

258
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,050
They've turned the fourth corner and hit the last stretch.

259
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,800
Arcade Humming in front.

260
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,640
Cheap Impact bearing down from the outside.

261
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,230
Gin-san, you're rooting for Hatsu and me, right?

262
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,650
Go! Cheap Impact!

263
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,820
He's pulled ahead! It's Cheap Impact!

264
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,950
Aw, yeah!

265
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,320
Uh, wait. What are you doing, Gin-san?!

266
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,290
You said you'd watch my battle all the way through!

267
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,140
Yeah, I will.

268
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,990
But I have my own battle going on at the same time.

269
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,210
Go! All the way through!

270
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,580
That's wrong! And dishonest!

271
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,240
And you're supposed to be the main character?!

272
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,350
Exactly!

273
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,480
As the main character, I have to win my battles!

274
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,920
This was the method I arrived at!

275
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,120
Think about it.

276
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,010
You're falling down a serious DORK Spiral.

277
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,010
It didn't matter what your prediction was.

278
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,230
The result would always be another step ahead.

279
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,330
So I decided to bet

280
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,490
on your tendency to have things backfires.

281
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,130
Wh-What does that mean?

282
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,940
I bet everything on the horse you crossed out first, Cheap Impact.

283
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,970
Don't hold a grudge.

284
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,330
I'm sick of losing everything with you when we gamble together!

285
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,820
This time, I'll use you as a stepping stone

286
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,290
to become a winner!

287
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,940
Gin-san, you've forgotten one critical thing.

288
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:32,570
I'm not the only one who suffers from the DORK Spiral backfiring.

289
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,640
Gin-san, it's the same for you!

290
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,930
You're such a poor loser.

291
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,340
Look at how my horse is leading...

292
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,600
Where are the others?

293
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,720
Bearded Miracle is coming from the inside.

294
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,910
Making a run on the outside is

295
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,790
Justaway!

296
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,620
Justaway has closed the gap!

297
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,640
Incredible speed!

298
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,810
What explosive speed!

299
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,810
Here it comes!

300
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,120
What?!

301
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,050
Gin-san, this is no longer an ordinary horse race.

302
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:01,820
It's the DORK Cup's final match to determine if I can escape this DORK Spiral!

303
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,290
Go, Justaway!

304
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,620
Cross the line, Justaway!

305
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,390
Escape, Cheap Impact!

306
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,250
Run away from Justaway!

307
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,880
Cheap Impact is in front!

308
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,570
Cheap Impact has a three length lead.

309
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,780
Justaway is closing in!

310
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,370
200 meters to go!

311
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,820
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

312
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,800
Pass him! Pass him! Pass him! Pass him!

313
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,120
Will it be Cheap Impact?

314
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,060
Or Justaway?

315
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,750
Cheap Impact or Justaway?

316
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,710
They're neck and neck!

317
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,720
An epic match!

318
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,600
Please! Please! Please! Please!

319
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,780
Cheap Impact?!

320
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,530
Justaway?!

321
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,480
Cheap Impact or Justaway?!

322
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,090
Cheap Impact?! Justaway?!

323
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,880
Cheap Impact or Justaway?!

324
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,180
Cheap Impact?! Justaway?!

325
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,920
Cheap Impact?! Justaway?!

326
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,250
Justaway breaks ahead and they cross the finish line!

327
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,020
Justaway has won!

328
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
H-Here it comes...

329
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,240
Finally, it's come...

330
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,800
Man! I can't take this anymore!

331
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,560
Damn it! Damn it! I demand a do over!

332
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,490
I did it...

333
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,830
I did it, Gin-san...

334
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,110
I've finally escaped the DORK Spiral...

335
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,680
I can finally graduate from being DORK...

336
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,190
Isn't that nice?

337
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,540
Hatsu...

338
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,630
Now I can go see you with my head held high...

339
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,800
A deliberation is being held regarding the fourth corner of Oedo Horse Race number 12.

340
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,720
The result of the deliberation is that Justaway went outside the boundary

341
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,220
at the fourth corner, blocking Bono Machan's path, and will be disqualified.

342
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,200
Justaway went outside the boundary at the fourth corner...

343
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,200
Wh-What was that?

344
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,680
I couldn't hear what he said.

345
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,980
What does it say on the screen?

346
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,300
My eyes are all teared up, so I can't see clearly.

347
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,230
Which means...

348
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,600
My ticket won!

349
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,480
What the hell is this?!

350
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,970
What did I do to deserve this?

351
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,480
Why did this have to happen?!

352
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,690
Why me?! Why?!

353
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,320
Hasegawa-san, what is this?!

354

[Suicide Note]

[Always remembered...]

357
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm not dead!

358
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,750
It's a gag anime, so I can't die!

359
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,810
God...

360
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,250
The staff is made up of a bunch of heartless bastards

361
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,450
who kill somebody off because they can't come up with a punch line!

362
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,140
Weren't you ever taught that crickets and worms

363
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,740
are still living creatures so you just treat them with care?!

364

365
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,290
Hey! Give it up already!

368
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,510
What? It's okay for me to bitch a bit?

369
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,430
Well, after three years, I've got a whole list of stuff to bitch about.

370
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,800
Even if I'm the main character of a JUMP series, I've got plenty of stuff to unload.

371
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,590
Actually, on second thought, I'm bitching all the time, so once you tell me to bitch,

372
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,360
I can't really think of anything.

["It Takes a Bit of Courage to Enter a Street Vendor's Stand"]

374
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,850
Hell, am I the only main character who bitches all the time?

375
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,860
[And the name of that stand is "Guchiriya."]
