3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,980
Men, don't give up!

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:15,060
[Will our savior come to this dying planet?]

5
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,790
It...

6
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,850
suddenly appeared beneath our feet...

7
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,420
What were they? Were they living creatures? Were they man-made?

8
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,370
Or was it something else entirely?

9
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,850
Before we could find out...

10
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,530
half of us were wiped out.

11
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,630
It split and multiplied at an incredible rate.

12
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,340
It instantly covered the world. By the time we figured out what it was...

13
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,710
The planet was no longer ours.

14
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,430
The only thing we learned...

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,660
was that it was neither alive nor man-made. It was "Despair" itself.

16
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,980
We were on the brink of annihilation.

17
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,340
So this is the place.

18
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,540
Do you think The Savior will come?

19
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,170
If he doesn't come, we'll be destroyed.

20
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,370
Not just the planet, but us too.

21
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,520
Come on. There are humans still living underground.

22
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,810
They've given up fighting and left the surface to "it."

23
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,460
They're just trembling in the dark soil.

24
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,260
Just like rotting corpses in a cemetery.

25
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,140
Captain, that's cruel.

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,130
Are you saying that women and children should fight monsters?

27
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,170
It destroyed the Royal Armed Forces in just twelve hours.

28
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,170
It hasn't been destroyed. You and I are still here.

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,630
Everyone fights the enemies that suit them.

30
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,750
Even women and children have things they can do. We do, too.

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,600
Like remain on the surface and partake in guerrilla warfare?

32
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,500
We won't be able to keep that up. I hope our savior gets here quickly.

33
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,020
I'm not sure if he's the legendary space-traveling janitor, or the strongest alien buster...

34
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,610
But I doubt he has the power to determine the fate of a country by himself.

35
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,820
Even if that legendary savior did exist...

36
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,220
The nation and the army have already collapsed.

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,990
Do you think such a person would come to the aid of two volunteer soldiers who can't offer any reward?

38
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,540
If he doesn't come, you and I will just die.

39
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,890
Captain, if I die, my wife and children underground will die, too.

40
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,190
They'll get insurance, right?

41
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,550
I won't ever commit suicide with you.

42
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,280
Captain, it's here!

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,510
It isn't the savior. It's a welcoming party.

44
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,490
Oh well. I'll distract them.

45
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,790
Women and children should leave...

46
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,180
and clean up the underground.

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,030
Ivanov...

48
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,490
I said I had no intention of committing suicide with you, captain.

49
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,550
No way!

50
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,930
A superior officer's orders are absolute.
I won't let you die without my permission!

51
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,830
We don't have any superior officers, let alone an army!

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,950
Even if I'm crushed by despair,
we must never forget...

53
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,050
Where there is light, there are shadows and where there are shadows, there is light.

54
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,680
No matter how dark the despair, there is...

55
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,480
...hope shining bright!

56
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

57
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,930
Are you the volunteer army that called me?

58
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,170
Our planet, which has long been trapped in darkness...

59
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,120
Oh, sorry. I haven't introduced myself.

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,800
...has finally seen the dazzling light of dawn...

61
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,470
My name is...

62
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,660
Umibozu.

63
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,490
What's wrong? Is there something on my face?

64
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,850
No.

65
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,670
It's nothing...

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,690
A toupee.

67
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,220
Umibozu is wearing a toupee.

68
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,680
Ivanov, don't stare at it like that.

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,340
Act like you don't notice it.
Pretend you don't know.

70
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,190
The fate of our planet depends on this man.

71
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,190
Well... But captain... That...

72
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,760
It's totally obvious... It's even sliding off...

73
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,710
There's just nylon on his head.

74
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,430
Ivanov, hold it in. You saw his strength, right?

75
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,020
That man...

76
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,550
is our only hope.

77
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,200
Even if he's wearing a toupee, he's invincible.

78
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,230
It's all over if we embarrass him and he leaves.

79
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,450
O-Okay. It's all right. I can do this...

80
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,490
This mission is way easier than that Apache landing operation five years ago.

81
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,920
W-We've been waiting for you, Umibozu-san.

82
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,470
I never thought I'd get to meet a living legend.

83
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,560
We never thought you'd really come.
I'm grateful for your help.

84
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm Kai.

85
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,730
This is Ivanov. Pleased to meet you.

86
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,970
I never expected this country to change so much in just three years.

87
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,540
What in the world happened?

88
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,610
What made your head change so much?

89
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,700
Three years ago, a giant black sphere erupted from the ground.

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:50,120
[Note: A similar plot device was used in the anime Space Pirate Captain Harlock.]

91
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,120
Countless spheres grew from it and it rapidly covered the surface of the world.

92
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,440
Half of this country's population has fallen victim to it.

93
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,650
Our army desperately fought it,

94
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,560
but after a bald battle, we were almost completely wiped out.

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,100
Huh? Bald?

96
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,880
Huh? B...No, I said, "bold battle." You're mistaken. No, no, no.

97
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,690
You're mistaken. It's not like that.

98
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,440
Huh? If it's not, then what is it?

99
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,900
I told you, I said "bold," not "bald"...

100
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,200
Hey! This time, you said "bald." You called me bald just now.

101
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,060
No, no, no. I didn't do that.

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,580
Well, I don't mind. I'm not bald... I have a head full of hair...

103
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,010
I don't mind, but people who are bald don't like bad jokes like that.

104
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,110
Apologize to all the bald people in the country.

105
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,540
He's so sensitive. This man's feelings are like glass.

106
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,320
I've got to be careful about words that sound like "bald."

107
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,980
I-I'm very sorry...

108
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,040
Why?! If he's so sensitive, why does he wear such a bad toupee?!

109
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,320
It's a bit odd for you to apologize to me.

110
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,250
I have a head full of hair.

111
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,970
Well, that's fine. Anyway, there's no point in arguing, so let's get going.

112
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,970
Are we riding in this?

113
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,980
I wonder if it's going to rain tomorrow...

114
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,260
I hate that... I have nowhere to hang my laundry...

115
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,620
He totally stepped into that one! We didn't see it. We didn't see anything.

116
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,160
I wonder if it's all right now.

117
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,410
We should give him time to put it on properly.

118
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,150
Then we won't have to worry about how bad it looks.

119
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,650
Let's wait a little longer.

120
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,030
Why does it look even more unnatural after he fixed it?

121
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,010
What's the meaning of this?
What was he thinking?

122
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,210
What kind of hair style is he after?!

123
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,750
No, this is definitely weird!! I can't look directly at him anymore.

124
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,060
His toupee has lost all purpose!!
It's obvious he's bald now!!

125
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,480
Captain, are we going to take him like this?

126
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,320
This is bad.

127
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,710
This is really bad.

128
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,110
Everyone, listen up!!

129
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,300
Why not put an end to living like moles in this filthy shelter?!

130
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,080
"It" has taken the surface from us, and we've lived for three years in humiliation!

131
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,480
The time to rally together is now!!

132
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,530
Our volunteer army has managed to summon the help of an invincible hero.

133
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,180
We've got the heroic living legend Umibozu!!

134
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
Tsk! Kai's blabbering off her speeches again.

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,510
There's no way that Umibozu would come here.

136
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,430
Who's that man with the strange head?
Where did you get that faker?

137
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,850
Whose head are you calling fake?!

138
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,410
They didn't say that!! No one said that!! Captain, stop him!!

139
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,650
With his help, we can be victorious!!

140
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,920
Everyone, please, let's work together!

141
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,030
The surface... This planet...

142
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,040
We will defend it ourselves!!

143
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,010
Mom, you're only carrying sis...that's not fair.

144
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,050
Bare?! Whose head is bare?!

145
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,030
I told you, you're hearing things!!

146
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,240
It's a toupee!! He's wearing a toupee!!

147
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,200
What kind of hero wears a toupee?!
Come up with a better story!!

148
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,180
Everyone, wait!! Listen to what I have to say!!

149
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Everyone!

150
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,650
Everyone!!

151
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,380
Sorry.

152
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,200
We embarrassed you...

153
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,370
We didn't mean it. Please forgive us.

154
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,890
Are you leaving?

155
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,070
You're done, right? Sorry I wasn't a good lure.

156
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,810
Of course, it was better for you if you didn't lure anyone.

157
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,980
You knocked my toupee off on purpose, didn't you?

158
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,560
Oh, you noticed. I underestimated you.

159
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,440
Now, my captain will calm down a bit.

160
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,140
She should give up any ideas of saving the planet from that monster.

161
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,500
This planet will be destroyed no matter what we do.

162
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,130
You're all talk. You don't even struggle.

163
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,010
It's useless to struggle.

164
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,930
If you want to see why, go to the surface and crush that giant bowling ball

165
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,510
my captain hates so much.

166
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,730
If you do that, this planet will still end.

167
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,910
It's the planet itself.

168
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,630
Our enemy is the very planet we're standing on.

169
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,430
Even if we defeated it, this planet will be destroyed.

170
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,540
It's the Atlas control system. It's the life of this planet.

171
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,020
Is this a man-made planet?

172
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,740
No... There's a control system at its core.

173
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,090
This planet was originally unlivable.

174
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,790
Clean air, rich soil, and clean water were all made possible because of Atlas.

175
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,340
Atlas is a purification system that maintains this planet's environment.

176
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,430
It cultivated things that were good for the planet and eliminated things that were bad.

177
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,950
But Atlas maintained the planet's balance for only a short while.

178
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,740
The population increased, resources were used up,

179
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,430
and the life of the planet was turned into money.

180
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,300
The land soon became barren, the sky became stagnate,

181
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,080
and the planet became a world of sand.

182
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,090
You know why Atlas revolted against humans, right?

183
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:58,910
It sees humans as a harmful threat to the planet.

184
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,200
It considers us as enemies.

185
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,160
Our devastated military said that it was a mysterious invader

186
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,980
made of an unknown material... But there were those who knew.

187
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,920
We'll be wiped out if we don't do anything.

188
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,820
But even if we fight Atlas and destroy it, this planet will still be wiped out.

189
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,680
Our only path is the path to extinction.

190
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,880
That's why no one wants to fight.

191
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,110
Even if we did, it wouldn't change anything.

192
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,830
No, even if they did fight Atlas, there's probably no way they could destroy it.

193
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,150
So they've chosen to slowly rot here rather than be wiped out in battle.

194
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,550
Aside from that girl...

195
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,370
My captain has no intention of perishing.
She still hasn't given up hope.

196
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,460
She'll probably fight even if she's alone.

197
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,060
I can't keep this up any longer.

198
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,110
I was helping her with guerrilla attacks to defend the shelter...

199
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,160
But what can I gain by fighting? This planet is no good. I can't live here anymore.

200
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,870
Even if we win, we'll only perish.

201
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,630
What is my captain fighting for?

202
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,470
It's an enemy attack!

203
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,760
It's here!

204
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,420
It's finally discovered the shelter!!

205
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,340
It's over!! We're finally finished!!

206
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,050
It's Kai!

207
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,910
Kai is retaliating by herself!

208
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,070
What are you doing?

209
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,850
Why aren't you going to help her?

210
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,070
Don't you know what she's fighting to defend?

211
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,070
It's hopeless... Even if we fight...

212
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,310
It looks like it's not just the planet that's already finished. It's you.

213
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,810
Tsk!

214
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,990
Captain, hold on!!

215
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,250
The seedling...

216
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,250
Is the seedling all right?

217
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,290
She was...

218
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,490
Growing a seedling in such a dry land...

219
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,970
That's...

220
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,650
It's a rescue convoy!

221
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,620
Yeah! They've finally come for us!

222
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,360
They said we're the only ones on this planet!
They said they'll let all of us get on!!

223
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,430
All right!! We're saved!!

224
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,130
We can finally say goodbye to this planet!!

225
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm not going.

226
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,600
C-Captain, what are you saying?

227
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,050
I said that I'm going to stay on this planet and fight until the end.

228
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,040
What's the point of fighting any longer?

229
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,240
You should already know.
This planet is no good.

230
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,790
It's all dried up. Grass and trees won't grow.

231
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,600
Furthermore, Atlas has gone haywire.

232
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,020
We can't live on this planet anymore!!

233
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,740
What good will come of running away?

234
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,460
Are you going to ruin the next planet you run away and escape to?

235
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,300
Are you going to keep on repeating that?

236
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,020
If the land is dry, we can pour water.

237
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,370
If flowers don't bloom, we can plant seeds.

238
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,010
We've been relying too much on Atlas.

239
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,920
Did we ever think of doing something about the planet ourselves?

240
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,850
Have we ever fought to protect this planet?

241
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,030
I don't understand large-scale things like planets.

242
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,290
But I have a wife and children to protect.

243
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,980
I have to live even if I have to discard my planet.

244
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,410
I cannot commit suicide with you and this planet.

245
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,860
Farewell, captain.

246
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,560
You're all alone now.

247
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,060
It's all right.

248
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,120
Everyone is fighting their own battles.
He's just headed to his.

249
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,620
Where are you fighting?

250
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,520
You're continuing to fight an enemy that will destroy the planet if you defeat it.

251
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,050
You won't even quit when everyone is gone from the planet.

252
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,930
What are you fighting for?

253
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,540
We've bound this planet with the chains called Atlas and treated it poorly.

254
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,390
Even if it's of no use anymore,

255
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,620
we can't just fling it into a corner of space chained up.

256
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,470
Someone has to release this planet from the curse of Atlas.

257
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,280
Even if it leads to its destruction?

258
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,990
It won't be destroyed.

259
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,730
If we support this planet in place of Atlas, seedlings are sure to grow...

260
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,170
In this dry land.

261
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,720
In other words, you don't give up easily?

262
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,150
I just hate to lose. I don't want to run away from battle.

263
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,210
I think the meaning of living is to fight.

264
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,720
If you turn your back on your battles,
you're just as good as dead.

265
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,650
I want to be a good person until the end.

266
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,120
Even if the planet is destroyed tomorrow,
I will not forfeit my honor.

267
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,730
I will be noble and beautiful until the end. I will do what I think is right.

268
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,020
I will not lose to myself, even in the end.

269
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,250
You're just like her.

270
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,740
My daughter. Or perhaps them...

271
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,740
Sorry, captain.

272
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,450
I don't want you to die.

273
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,050
Don't worry. You're already more than beautiful enough.

274
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,920
You can be my witness.

275
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,930
Thanks...

276
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,800
Take her away.

277
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,720
Umibozu-san, what about you?

278
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,810
Huh?

279
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,540
I'm going to get my toupee.

280
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,130
Kagura-chan, something's changed in your father.

281
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,760
I've opened a strange door that I would've never opened before.

282
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,200
Something's happened ever since I went to earth.

283
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,840
Your father... Your father...

284
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,310
Is going to crush a planet...

285
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,150
for the sake of a woman!!

286
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,220
I'm one hip, bad daddy!

287

288

Keep this a secret from your mother!!

289
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,920
What happened?

290
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,370
In just three months...

291
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,080
It has to be him.

292
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,220
He couldn't have done it by himself...

293
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,340
He destroyed a planet for the sake of a woman.

294
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,900
No... He probably has his own battles.

295
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,800
And, look.

296
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,750
It's not destroyed.

297
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,780
It's still alive.

298
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,490
Even if you're crushed by despair...

299
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,480
You must never forget that where there is light,

300
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,870
there are shadows and where there are shadows, there is light.

301
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,650
No matter how dark the despair, there is hope shining bright!

302
