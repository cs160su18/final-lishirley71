3
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,240
Hello everyone, I'm Hitoyoshi Kusano.

4
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,260
First, an exclusive scoop.

5
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:45,350
Our "The Edo" crew has successfully contacted a major figure of the Anti-Foreigner Faction.

6
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,650
[Note: Pronounciation of her name sounds like "nostril".]

7
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,650
Here is Announcer Hanano with the report.

8
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,730
[Note: Hanano-saki sounds like "tip of the nose" in Japanese]

9
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,730
Hello, I'm Saki Hanano.

10
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,900
My special report is about this man...

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,040
He is well-known to the Anti-Foreigner Faction...

12
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,720
yet is elusive like a phantom.

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,090
He saves the weak and conquers the powerful... The last samurai.

14
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,850
Wanted by the Bakufu, but popular among the people of Edo...

15
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,150
Also known as The Unstoppable, the one and only K-san.

16
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,350
He is considered a major figure by the police department.

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,070
Since he is currently a wanted man,

18
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,620
we cannot reveal his real name and we've kept his face hidden.

19
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,700
We were permitted only one day to interview him.

20
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,530
The mysterious veil shrouding the Anti-Foreigner Faction is about to be lifted and the truth revealed.

21
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,580
Where do they see this country going and what do they think must be done?

22
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,990
The Edo's special feature, "The Dawning of Japan."

23
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,220
A secret day in the life of The Unstoppable, follows right after these messages!

27
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,040
Hello, I'm Announcer Hanano from Edo Tonight.

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,230
Hello.

29
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,650
Thank you for agreeing to our interview.

30
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,350
Please let me confirm. You are The Unstoppable, K-san?

31
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,200
Not K-san. It's Katsura.

32
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,590
No, but... you asked me to use an alias...

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,600
K-tsura-san.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,450
It's not K-tsura-san. It's Katsura!

35
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,480
Umm... Are you sure you want to give your real name?

36
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,690
[Note: "pii" as in a bleep censor]

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,690
Oh right. Add in a "pii."

38
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,430
Okay, I'll add a "pii."

39
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,080
So [censor beep]-san.

40
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,840
Not [censor beep]! It's Katsura!

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,670
Oh, well...never mind.

42
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,880
Oh, but we'll distort your face, so your identity won't be revealed.

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,110
Distort?! What? Is my face distorted right now?!

44
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,350
Yes, is that a problem?

45
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,630
Remove it right now! Doing such an obscene thing to a person's face is unacceptable!

46
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,460
No, but we're just being cautious for your sake...

47
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,540
Don't do me any favors!

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,230
Besides, it's more of a problem if people think my face goes against what is considered good taste.

49
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,740
Remove it immediately! Who do you think I am?!

50
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,210
Oh but...

51
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:22,340
I am a master of disguise. I am under disguise right now.

52
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,250
I am nicknamed "Getaway Kotaro." As if I would reveal my true self so easily.

53
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,580
Oh, but you've already revealed your real first and last name.

54
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,130
A woman should not speak of "revealing" herself.

55
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,350
Well, I don't quite understand...

56
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,930
But never mind.

57
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,480
I'm sorry. Anyway, we'll remove the distortion on your face.

58
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,200
Umm... let me return to my questions. K-san, I mean Katsura-san...

59
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,500
Why did you agree to this close-up interview today?

60
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,610
Well...

61
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,840
First of all, I want people to understand what the Anti-Foreigner Faction stands for.

62
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,410
Many people are afraid of us because we have been labeled as

63
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,640
criminals, terrorists, and guerillas...as dangerous men.

64
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,470
Most people in society do believe that.

65
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,120
However, that is wrong.

66
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,540
It's true that there are robbers and bandits.

67
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,630
Enjoy.

68
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,150
Thank you.

69
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,170
However, that's just a small segment.

70
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,740
Most of us love this nation and want to change it.

71
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,810
We want people to understand that we are loyal patriots.

72
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,930
...I see.

73
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,610
Secondly...

74
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,880
Secondly... Huh?

75
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,680
It's hard to eat with this on!

76
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,550
The moustache gets in the way!

77
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,760
K-Katsura-san!

78
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,930
[Note: Literally, she says "marumie" or "open to view." But Katsura puts a sexual spin on it.]

79
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,830
Your...face is in plain view! ...

80
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,930
A woman shouldn't speak about anything being in plain view!

81
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,320
I didn't mean it like that!

82
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,730
Ikumatsu-dono, what is the meaning of ramen noodles during an interview? Are you...

83
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,220
We're a ramen shop. If you want tea, go to a teashop.

84
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,160
Geez, bringing a whole brigade in here...!

85
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,850
She scolded me.

86
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,260
No, never mind that. But your face is in plain view.

87
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,750
Don't use that phrase!

88
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,780
Look, never mind that already.

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,580
Hmm... Where were we?

90
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,280
Yes... you were answering my question about why you agreed to our interview.

91
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,190
You were on the second reason.

92
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,050
Oh, yes, yes.

93
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,640
The second reason. Well, the second reason is...

94
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,530
Huh?

95
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,010
There's no second reason. Just one will do.

96
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,880
This aroma is richer than before... Delicious...

97
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,780
Oh, I see...

98
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,220
Well then, you wanted to broadcast the mission of the Anti-Foreigner Faction to everyone watching.

99
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,960
And you want each viewer to ponder about what can be done for this country.

100
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,640
Am I correct?

101
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,160
Oh yes, that's it.

102
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,110
That's just what I wanted to say.

103
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,580
What kind of stock did she use?

104
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,400
Flying fish? Dried mackerel?

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,300
Excuse me! Please don't "shoot from the hip" like that that.

106
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:09,150
[Note: She literally says, "koshi o oru" which means bend your hips, but Katsura takes it sexually.]

107
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,150
Don't use uncouth phrases like "massage the hip"!

108
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,980
He totally misunderstood.

109
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,010
Rather, that's an old lecher's gag line.

110
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,230
Right. Even when you are in the midst of a secret mission,

111
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,620
you must not forget hidden meanings and flavors.

112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,680
Yes. So may I go on to the next question?

113
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,020
Like your daily schedule.

114
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,680
Elizabeth!

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,960
What's wrong? What happened?!

116
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,260
What is happening?! A strange creature has crashed into our interview site!

117
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,560
That's no strange creature! That's Elizabeth!

118
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,110
Katsura!

119
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,840
Your number is up today!

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,790
I-It's the Shinsengumi! What is going on?!

121
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,480
They knew where the interview was taking place!

122
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,440
Die! Katsura!!

123
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,420
And in this manner, a hectic day begins.

124
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,140
It's about time I left...

125
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,500
[Note: She is dressed as Eligo 13, a spoof of Golgo 13]

126
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,500
[Revival]

127
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,500
Huh? Is this part of the schedule?

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,960
Of course! Can the cameraman follow?

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,500
I don't want to block his way.

130
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,760
Katsura!

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,640
Hey! What's the big idea crashing my place like this?!

132
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,260
Oh, sorry.

133
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,920
Katsura-san, you seem to be accustomed to this crazy situation.

134
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,300
Does this happen a lot?

135
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,880
Well, yes. Those guys always show up anytime, anyplace.

136
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,480
Especially during mealtimes and when I'm asleep.

137
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,730
When most people tend to be off their guard.

138
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,210
Exactly.

139
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,710
They think I'm defenseless, but in three years, they have never been successful.

140
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,360
They can attack at mealtimes if they like...

141
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,600
Because I have Tasty Stick snacks on me at all times.

142
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,210
This one's corn potage.

143
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,580
I love them, too. The corn potage-flavored ones.

144
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,820
I love the rich flavor as it goes down my throat.

145
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,370
But the only disappointment

146
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,810
is that it often disintegrates into powder because I hold on to it for so long.

147
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,060
I see... After all, your work is very dangerous.

148
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,790
I'm fully aware of that. Every man from the moment he is born,

149
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,030
must live life prepared to die.

150
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,900
[If you are always prepared, you can remain calm. No matter what happens, there is no fear.]

151
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,140
If you are always prepared, you can remain calm.

152
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,900
No matter what happens, there is no fear.

153
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,750
To be honest, I've never known fear ever since I was born.

154
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,640
Now then, I'm going to escape from here.

155
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,540
Katsura!!

156
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
Katsura-san, didn't you just yelp?

157
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,530
That was a battle cry! You mistook it for "Uryahh!"

158
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,520

It's a morning filled with heroism. Truly like an Anti-Foreigner patriot.

Umm... Katsura-san, aren't you getting off the roof?

No, I'm not.

167

When you're a big name like me, you get recognized immediately on the streets.

Katsura-san, you said you were a master of disguise.

Does that mean it hasn't been working?

Katsura-san, are you ignoring me?

There are others besides us who walk on rooftops.

What do you do here, Katsura-san?

199

Anti-Foreigner Faction members mainly exchange information.

All kinds of data that we've gathered from our travels here and there.

207
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,850
Mostly the state of the universe and classified news of the Bakufu government.

208
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,370
We exchange them and slowly spread them.

209
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,270
Namely, we exchange ideas and viewpoints with those in higher positions and try to persuade them.

00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,430
[Spoof of "Uchi Kuru?!" COME TO MY "HOME SWEET HOME" a TV show that visits a celebrity's hometown.]

318
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,060
How about something touching like that?

319
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,430
What are you talking about?!

320
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,530
Do you want a letter?

321
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,000
You may be popular now, but long ago,

322
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,540
maybe you were a wimp who was always teased for looking like a girl.

323
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,490
Or a teacher from grade school said some embarrassing things about you!!

324
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,890
Is that what you want?!

325
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,620
Don't tell me you don't have a letter?

326
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,120
Of course not! We're not interested in any of your friends!

327
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,250
I figured as much and already have one ready.

328
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,270
Just how prepared are you?! Just how much is according to your plans?!

329
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,830
Wait for the right moment, then present it. It will be a touching scene.

330
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,440
I'm counting on you. It took me all night to write it!!

331
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,220
You wrote it?! That's enough to make me cry!

332
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,910
Eat this!!

333
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,780
In order to get ratings, a little bit of faking is necessary.

334
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,810
That's not the point!

335
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,620
Where is the boundary between "the real" and "the fake"?

336
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,620
I want everyone in mass media to ask themselves that!

337
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,290
What?! Are you judging the mass media?!

338
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,360
Huh? Katsura-san, can you see that up ahead?!

339
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,350
Up front!! Up ahead! Ahead!

340
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,700
Make sure you get this on camera!

341
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,810
This is how an Anti-Foreigner patriot lives!

342
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,290
I've been nervous about that for a while.

343
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,710
Careful! That camera is really old!

344
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,430
Hey, cameraman! Did you get my jump just now?

345
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,340
It was better than Jackie himself!

346
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,790
[Note: He's referring to Jackie Chan.]

347
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,790
Got it all, Katsura-san!

348
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,230
Good.

349
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,470
Where am I?!

350
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,530
Huh? You just noticed?

351
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,730
We're in the middle of shooting an action scene that surpasses even Jackie's!

352
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,410
What do you mean? I don't understand!

353
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,520
Propaganda must be convincing and have images full of power and intensity!

354
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,690
By the way, can you make me a copy of this later? I'm going to send it back home.

355
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,850
Back home? You're gonna send it back?!

356
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,610
Katsura...

357
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,830
It's time to say your prayers.

358
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,770
Don't panic. I'm The Unstoppable.

359
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,120
They'll be more afraid of me and miss.

360
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,600
Announcer Hanano, make sure you tell the people of this nation

361
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,050
what kind of people we Anti-Foreigner patriots were!

362
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,190
Katsura-san?!

363
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,190
I'm counting on you.

364
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,730
So long, Katsura.

365
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,030
Katsura-san!!

366
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,810
Huh? Huh?!

367
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,500
If you are always prepared, you can remain calm.

368
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,340
No matter what happens, there is nothing to fear!

369
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,350
Katsura-san...

370
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,630
Okita-san! It's going to take a while to recharge!

371
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,310
Damn it! Let's go!

372
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,750
Look!

373
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,970
Bye bee!

374
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,570
[Bye bee]

375
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,870
No way!

376
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,110
He's dangerous! He's so outdated! He's too outdated!

377
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,990
Hey! You there, woman! Don't move!

378
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,490
You're one of Katsura's friends.

379
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,350
No, I'm just reporting...

380
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,210
Don't lie. You're coming with me for questioning!

381
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,090
No!

382
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,400
What's this?

383
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,630
To everyone in the Shinsengumi...

384
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,720
I know it's odd to ask this of an enemy,

385
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,900
but please don't lay a hand on the woman in front of you.

386
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,310
She is simply a journalist and I made her come do a story on me.

387
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,010
She has nothing to do with the Anti-Foreigner Faction.

388
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,280
You are my enemy, but as a man who also wishes for the happiness of the people of Edo,

389
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,790
as a samurai who lives for truth... I want to believe in you all.

390
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,180
To Announcer Hanano and her two-man crew,

391
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,550
I admire you all for putting yourselves in harm's way in order to report the truth.

392
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,150
And while we both work in different ways,

393
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,400
you too, are patriots who desire peace in Edo.

394
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,140
We are comrades.

395
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,420
Please continue your endeavors. I will be watching every day.

396
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,780
Kotaro Katsura.

397
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,950
P.S.!

398
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,170
Okita-san? What's this ticking sound?

399
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,950
What is this?

400
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,990
All Shinsengumi should die!

401
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,720
The thing to look for is the long hair. This messy long hair.

402
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,050
He always has Tasty Sticks on hand

403
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,980
to use as trump cards and his sense of humor is totally outdated.

404
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,580
You'll get sick just talking to him for a minute.

405
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,360
If you see this face,

406
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,210
please call the police immediately.

407
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,220
Go to hell, Katsura!!

408

["Rhinoceros Beetles Teach Boys That Life is Precious"]

409
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,820
The next episode! Beetle hunting!

410
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,450
[The Odd Jobs Trio find out that rhinoceros beetles can be sold at high prices and set out to catch them!!]

411
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,690
[But when they get to the forest, the Shinsengumi is already hard at work.]
