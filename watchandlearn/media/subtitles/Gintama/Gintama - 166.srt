00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,380
Man, I'm sleepy...

3
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,810
Three days without any action.

4
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,150
But he should be making a move soon.

5
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,830
Hijikata here.

6
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,720
No change here yet.

7
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,550
How's it going over there?

8
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,970
Roger.

9
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,320
No, don't just roger me.

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,530
I'm asking how the back door looks.

11
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,470
How's it going over there?

12
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,470
I prefer more MSG flavor.

13
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,770
Huh?

14
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,810
Oh, just an issue on my side.

15
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,130
More like a taste issue.

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:39,120
[Whinery]

17
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,070
Why are you eating in the
middle of a stakeout?

18
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,720
And your slurping's too loud!

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,340
Hey, big guy.

20
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,440
You're bothering the other customers.

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,170
Could you stop talking
on your cell phone?

22
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,460
Roger.

23
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,540
Roger, my ass!

24
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,970
Get back to your post!

25
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,140
Bastard...pisses me off.

26
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,850
Uh, excuse me.

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,450
Could you move?

28
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,360
Huh? You're...

29
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,620
["Two Is Better Than One. Two
People Are Better Than One."]

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,830
Look here...

31
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,630
You see?

32
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,290
This is where everybody
throws their trash.

33
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,830
It's not like this place belongs
to you, ya know?

34
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,530
Or what?

35
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,880
Is this your trash can?

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,460
He's half asleep.

37
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,290
He hasn't noticed me?

38
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,730
Tch.

39
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,490
I just had to run into this troublemaker...

40
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,870
I don't have time to deal with him.

41
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,280
Stuff that belongs to everyone
should be shared by everyone.

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,890
Stuff that belongs to you should
be shared by everyone.

43
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,260
Like a reverse Jaian kind of thing.

44
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,260
[Note: Parody of Jaian from Doraemon. His famous
line is "Your stuff is mine, my stuff is mine."]

45
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,760
You have to follow the proper
manners for sharing.

46
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,470
Got it?

47
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,060
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

48
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,100
My bad.

49
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,680
What kind of response is that?

50
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,040
You think that's enough to get
you out of any situation?

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,240
Are you like a husband on
his third year of marriage?

52
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,230
Getting weary of the married life?

53
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,270
I get it, so keep it down!

54
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,260
Then look me in the eye!

55
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,070
Ah.

56
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,770
Don't "Ah" me.

57
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,670
It's too early to be dealing
with your blabbing.

58
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,690
I'm working here.

59
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,610
So the citizens can pile
up their trash in peace.

60
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,640
So scram if you don't want me
to drag you down to the station!

61
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,180
What are you doing, psycho cop?!

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,910
You're seriously pissing me off!

63
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,870
Hey, hey, now. You for real?

64
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,530
Using binoculars to peep
this early in the morning?

65
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,400
And you're getting all excited?

66
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
So you're like a sex offender?

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,750
That's not funny.

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,830
Especially for this show.

69
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,140
Who are you accusing of peeping?!

70
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,580
I said to stop blabbing!

71
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,350
If you keep bugging me, I swear I'll arrest
you for obstructing an officer's duties.

72
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,460
Go right ahead!

73
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,520
You should take a look
inside your own soul

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,630
before you peep on other people's lives!

75
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,230
Check out one of your embarrassing
childhood memories!

76
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,870
It might even make you cry!

77
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,220
Huh?

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,960
You're under arrest for interfering

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,880
with a police investigation and
insulting a police officer.

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,060
That's not funny!

81
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,630
Behave yourself, damn it!

82
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,060
Huh?

83
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,900
Hey, Sogo.

84
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,280
I arrested someone for interfering
with the investigation.

85
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,680
Take him to the station for me.

86
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,760
Roger.

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,470
Pops, give me some more
noodles, extra firm.

88
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,470
Roger!

89
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,920
Roger, my ass!

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,110
Why are you ordering more noodles?!

91
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,240
Get your ass over here now!

92
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,990
You're late.

93
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,110
Master, whatcha doing?

94
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,840
Nothing at all.

95
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,210
This is an unlawful arrest.

96
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,630
I didn't do anything.

97
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,500
Sogo, you aren't doing your job anyway,

98
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,690
so take him down to the
station and lock him up.

99
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,970
I can't do that.

100
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,380
My duty comes before my life.

101
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,690
Who was the one eating
ramen a moment ago?!

102
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,160
Huh?

103
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,340
Er, the key's gone.

104
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,680
What?

105
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,440
Hey, Sogo.

106
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,370
Use your key to unlock us.

107
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,470
Yeah, get these off.

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,360
Hey. What is this, Okita-kun?

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,020
Why are you cuffing me?!

110
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,270
I'm going back to my post now.

111
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,350
Okita-kun!

112
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,020
Get these off us! What are you thinking?!

113
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,980
Well, don't you think...

114
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,890
it's a lot more fun this way?

115
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,100
Then I'll be going.

116
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,820
Hey, hold up!

117
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,780
Damn it, Sogo!

118
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,440
Fine!

119
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,680
Give me the key!

120
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,240
Just give me the key!

121
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,630
I told you to give me the
''key''! Not mayonnaise!

122
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,420
What are you talking about?

123
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,630
Aren't you always keen
about mayonnaise?

124
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,470
Clever!

125
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,810
Very clever, but we don't
need any puns right now!

126
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,210
Take care of yourselves then.

127
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,100
Hey! Okita-kun!

128
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,280
Don't be so hasty!

129
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,560
You should have a more
positive outlook on life!

130
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Sogo!

131
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,480
Sogo, listen up, damn it!

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,430
I'm gonna kill you later, Sogo!

133
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,680
Hey, Okita-kun!

134
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,210
You're coming back, right?!

135
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,680
You're going to listen to
your superior, right?!

136
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,020
Damn it, Sogo!

137
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,820
Don't look at me.

138
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,170
Hey, hey, hey... Give me a break.

139
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,940
Why do I have to be stuck with
Mr. Master-of-pissing-me-off?

140
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,120
Hold on a sec.

141
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,970
I didn't check my horoscope today.

142
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,980
How does taking out the trash lead to
being paired with throbby-vein-boy?

143
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,290
At this rate, all of my investigating
will have been for nothing.

144
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,540
In any case, I need to get
out of this situation pronto!

145
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,330
Ack!

146
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,690
Target's on the move!

147
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,170
Hey! Why are you going that way?!

148
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,090
I'm headed for the station.

149
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,430
They've got a spare key
for the handcuffs, right?

150
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,300
What are you babbling about?!

151
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,060
We've been chasing this radical Anti-Foreigner
Faction member for over a month!

152
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,430
He's on the wanted list...

153
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,250
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

154
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,120
Let's go to the station and get these off.

155
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,660
A month of work will go down
the drain if I miss this chance!

156
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,000
Can't you understand?!

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,560
Drain schmain. You can play
cops and robbers later.

158
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,180
Give me my freedom and justice already!

159
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,560
The worst possible timing...

160
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,820
Hey, Sogo!

161
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,600
Target's on the move!

162
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,170
Follow him!

163
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,340
Hey, Sogo!

164
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,070
Bah! After him!

165
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,120
Hey!

166
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,540
The girl you like will run away
if you're always on the chase!

167
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,700
I can't let him get away now!

168
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,790
It's got nothing to do with me!

169
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,250
I'm going to arrest you
for obstructing justice.

170
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,670
I've already been arrested!

171
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,950
Cut it out already!

172
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,580
Justice!

173
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,300
Is this how you ask someone
for a favor, bastard?!

174
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,380
He's right...

175
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,340
I have to convince him to help
or else nothing will get done.

176
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,390
I'll have to ask him...

177
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,960
What are you doing?

178
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,100
None of your business!

179
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,850
Uh, well...

180
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,550
Could you help me chase down an
Anti-Foreigner Faction fugitive?

181
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,010
Or yeah, something...like that...

182
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,940
Well?

183
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,550
Huh?

184
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,010
That's not good enough, Hijikata.

185
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,360
You need to get down on
your knees and beg.

186
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,420
Shove it!

187
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,870
And chase the fugitive, damn it!

188
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,420
That's right. On your knees.

189
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,480
That's the standard procedure for
asking a favor, Hijikata-kun.

190
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,610
Fine.

191
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,550
Okay! I'm down on my knees!

192
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,920
Okay! I'm down on my knees!

193
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,200
Please help me chase the fugitive!

194
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,530
Okay! I'm down on my knees!

195
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,790
Ow! That hurts!

196
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,980
Okay! I'm down on my knees!

197
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,570
Cut it out!

198
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,310
Why?!

199
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,640
Well I won't get these handcuffs
off until you agree to come.

200
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,450
I'll do as you say for now,
so buy me a parfait.

201
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,600
Later.

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,950
I can't take my eyes off him right now.

203
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,490
Just capture him already.

204
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,270
It can't be that hard.

205
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,130
Our goal isn't to catch him.

206
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,520
Our ultimate goal is to follow him to their
base and round up the whole lot.

207
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,390
Lot schmot.

208
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,400
Forget the tedious stuff
and get this over with.

209
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,540
Shut up!

210
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,060
Amateurs should keep their mouths shut!

211
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,390
Hijikata, you're acting way too arrogant towards
someone who's helping you out.

212
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,070
Be more polite.

213
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,870
I don't wanna hear another
word outta you!

214
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,800
And stop staring at us!

215
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,660
We're following him in.

216
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,100
Act natural.

217
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,890
How is this natural?!

218
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,460
Well, you know?

219
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,050
We're going with the story that
our parents were dancers

220
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,590
so we have a natural tendency to dance.

221
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,720
That's not what I meant by natural.

222
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,940
Uh, you should say something
about the rose first.

223
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,580
Where the hell are you
watching us from?!

224
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,230
Sorry to keep you waiting.

225
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,880
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,240
I'm just eating this parfait.

227
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,230
You screwed up my aim with the mayonnaise
when you moved your arm.

228
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,870
What do you need mayonnaise for?

229
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,330
Why are you adding mayonnaise
to coffee?

230
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,180
Mayonnaise is an all-mighty
universal condiment

231
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,050
that works on everything and anything.

232
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,710
Are you an idiot?

233
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,610
Damn it! Don't ruin my parfait!

234
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,010
I didn't ruin it!

235
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,080
Damn amateur...

236
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,790
Hijikata-san. Hijikata-san.

237
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,710
What is it?

238
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,460
I just remembered that I forgot
to tell you something.

239
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,640
That mayonnaise I gave you...

240
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,170
Hi-ji-ka-ta-kun...

241
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,090
Had laxative in it.

242
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,190
I need to take a shit.

243
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,810
No way.

244
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,160
H-H-H-Hold it right there!

245
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,220
What is it?

246
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,530
I can't wait any longer!

247
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,540
Think for a second.

248
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,700
Can both of us take a
crap in the same stall?

249
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,870
We can't!

250
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,380
That'd be like a rendezvous
in the restroom.

251
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,250
A rendezvous with our bowels in agony!

252
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,220
You're right...

253
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,550
That thought is scary enough.

254
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,700
What do we do then?!

255
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Don't get too worked up.

256
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,190
We have knowledge and
paper on our side!

257
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,180
We can come up with the
best possible plan...

258
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,600
Let's start with plan A.

259
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,460
One of us conducts his business while
the other waits on top of the door.

260
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,680
But there's the risk that the person
waiting will have to watch the act.

261
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,240
What's plan B?

262
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,650
B...

263
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,920
The person waiting outside sticks
his hand through the door.

264
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,640
But then the door can't be
completely shut or locked.

265
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,320
Plan C...

266
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,420
Plan C...

267
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,490
While allowing the door to be locked and
avoiding having to witness the act,

268
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,880
the person conducting his business
must bend down,

269
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,880
while the person waiting risks having
to lay down on the floor.

270
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,350
Now which one do you want?

271
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,400
The unlocked door is a problem,
but I'll go with plan B.

272
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,820
Same here.

273
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,830
All that's left is to decide the order.

274
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,460
First comes rock.

275
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,110
Rock, paper, scissors!

276
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,440
Alright!

277
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,420
No, wait.

278
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,820
You went after I did.

279
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,640
There's no time for false accusations
in this emergency!

280
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,370
No! An emergency is
exactly the time for it!

281
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,280
I won't let you go!

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,030
We're screwed!

283
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,730
[Plan A, Plan B, Plan C]

284
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,420
Japanese-style...!

285
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,110
Japanese-style...

286
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,580
It'll work if we face each other,

287
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,240
but the lack of height means that
plan A will no longer work!

288
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,820
And there's too much distance between the
toilet and the door so plan B's also out...

289
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,200
C will be tough, too...

290
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,720
Which means...

291
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,130
I can't take anymore...

292
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,630
No more...

293
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,840
Has God...

294
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,200
...forsaken us?

295
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,320
No, wait...

296
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,660
There's still plan D.

297
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,060
Plan D, you say...?

298
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,520
Plan D...

299
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,050
The other person does a handstand above
the person conducting his business.

300
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,980
The door's locked,

301
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,000
and the person above won't
have to witness the act,

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,250
but both people must be strong enough
for this prohibited and risky maneuver.

303
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,110
Is that even possible?!

304
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,290
We have no choice!

305
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,730
Hijikata-san. Odd Jobs Master.

306
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,900
You okay in there?

307
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,490
Shut up!

308
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,410
You took way too long.

309
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,700
My arms are all numb.

310
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,840
You used too much paper.

311
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,460
I only had 10 cm to use.

312
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,600
I won't let him get away!

313
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,030
Stop! This is the police!

314
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,190
Move, damn it! I can't see!

315
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,080
There's a truck! A truck!

316
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,140
Right! Right!

317
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,860
Stupid! Not that way!

318
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,180
You told me to go right!

319
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,920
The side you hold your
chopsticks with, idiot!

320
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,340
Who are you calling an idiot, idiot?!

321
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,940
I'll kill you!

322
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,320
I said to go right, idiot!

323
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,220
Shut the hell up!

324
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,700
What are you doing?!

325
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,610
I went right, dumbass!

326
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,370
I meant my right, obviously!

327
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,230
Adults are supposed to be smart enough
to see from another person's perspective!

328
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,030
Shut up!

329
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,890
Besides, you should have realized
that the second time around!

330
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,080
As if I'm going to follow your orders!

331
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,100
I can't even tell anymore!

332
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,120
That's what I should be saying!

333
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,350
Okay...

334
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,840
We somehow managed
to track him down.

335
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,890
Hold on...

336
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,340
You're not done yet?

337
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,710
Hey, Sogo.

338
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,620
Send reinforcements.

339
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,050
Hey, Sogo.

340
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,090
Haven't you realized that's
a waste of time?

341
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,950
Tch.

342
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,620
Guess I have no choice.

343
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,180
Hey, now. Hijikata-kun.

344
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,120
What do you have in mind?

345
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,610
Don't tell me you're going to barge in.

346
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,050
Of course I am.

347
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,550
I can't let this chance slip
away after coming so far.

348
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,990
I'm pretty tired...

349
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,880
Want me to get down
on my knees again?

350
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,810
Good work.

351
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,180
Nobody noticed you, right?

352
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,470
Of course not!

353
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,390
Good...

354
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,690
There's a boat in the harbor.

355
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,590
Move the stuff and escape.

356
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,100
Yes!

357
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,980
Damn it. I won't let...

358
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,380
Hijikata-san, you rang?

359
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,490
Idiot!

360
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,710
Hijikata-san.

361
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,400
What happened to the target?

362
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,940
Hijikata-san?

363
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,770
Somebody's here!

364
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,380
Crap!

365
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,110
You just had to drop your radio!

366
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,310
Shut up!

367
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,740
Flip over so I can land on you!

368
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,590
Oh, we've got two rats here.

369
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,360
You two have guts to sneak
in by yourselves.

370
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,280
And they're handcuffed.

371
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,100
Friendly guys, huh?

372
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,160
Friendly...

373
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,510
Guys, you say...?

374
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,150
You can go to the next world together!

375
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:59,000
Who did you just accuse of being friendly
with this mayonnaise addict?!

376
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,860
Apologize to mayonnaise,
you sugar freak!

377
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm the Shinsengumi Vice-Chief,
Toshiro Hijikata, damn it!

378
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,570
You're all under arrest for interfering

379
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,000
with a police investigation and
insulting a police officer, dumbasses!

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,370
What a laugh.

381
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,240
Kill them!

382
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,300
Wh-Who are these guys?

383
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,500
Are they monsters?

384
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,780
What are you doing?!

385
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,550
Attack all at once!

386
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,680
Damn it!

387
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,320
What a crazy combo!

388
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,620
For all your talk, you guys
sure are getting along fine!

389
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,960
Hell no!

390
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,850
Die together!

391
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,570
I said...

392
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,330
...we're not together!

393
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,280
Well, well...

394
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,060
You're late.

395
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,620
You get to clean this mess up.

396
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,060
Damn it...

397
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,550
We won't forget this!

398
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,310
Pretty sure this will take more
than a simple clean-up.

399
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,060
Now, now.

400
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,170
All's well that end's well.

401
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,870
Everything worked out in the end.

402
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,430
So what do we do?

403
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,650
Do I take Master down to the station?

404
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,660
Interfering with a police investigation
and insulting a police officer, was it?

405
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,810
Hey, now.

406
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,740
That's not funny!

407
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,700
You're still going to drag
me down there?!

408
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,330
Forget it, Sogo.

409
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,070
I don't want to see his face for a while.

410
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,100
Moron!

411
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,630
That's what I should be saying.

412
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,730
The two of them really do get along.

413
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,290
We don't get along.

414
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:16,220

Did everyone beat it already?

418
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,850
I haven't yet.

419
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,290
That's bad.

420
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,700
I'll miss out on all the chatter.

421
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,930
Don't spoil the name of
the last boss for me!

422

Okay, then next week's GinTama
won't be aired until I beat it.
