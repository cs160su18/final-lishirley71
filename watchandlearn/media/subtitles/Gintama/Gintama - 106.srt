country was called that are long past.

00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,410
What's with the intro? Didn't we
already do that a year ago?

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,860
Have we run out of new material?

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,600
No, actually, TV-Tokyo's ratings
have been pretty good,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,800
so we thought it'd be nice to explain the
GinTama world to our new viewers.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,210
So after a year and a half of hard time,
spring has finally come to this anime!

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,140
I heard it was because reruns of "The
Prince of Tennis" that started in April,

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,650
in the time slot before GinTama,
are doing extremely well.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,650
Eh?

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,620
He was lavish in his praise
for "The Prince of Tennis."

[Note: Parody of "You've got ways to go" famous
phrase by Ryoma Echizen from Prince of Tennis.]

sports series... This week we try soccer.]

Here we go! We're in stoppage time
in the second half!

18

Come on...

20
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,530
Go.

21
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,960
Do it!

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,410
It's up to you!

23
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,300
Now!

24
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,370
Kick it!

25
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,260
This is it!

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,410

What waits at the end of the road
for those who seek to score?

30
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,750
If I remain true to what I believe,

31
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,340
even in this match that marks the end
of the road...I will see everything.

What is this?! What's going on?!

43
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,310
Who are you? Who are you people?!

44
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,840
Wh-Who are we, you ask?

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,050
Well, we're like beer vendors.

46
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,350
We came here to sell beer,

47
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,240
but they said they couldn't
drink beer before a match.

48
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,860
They said they only wanted Bocari,

49
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,860
[Note: Bocari is a wordplay on Pocari Sweat,
a Japanese sports drink, available in powder form.]

50
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,690
so I went looking for Bocari powder
and made some for them.

51
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,940
No! That wasn't Bocari powder!

52
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,590
That was the powder they
use to mark the field lines!

Shinpachi, who is this guy?

He's, you know, FC Oedo's star
player, Daisaku Amarao.

Yes...and I'm the symbol of
this team. Its best player.

63
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,100
For the past 20 years, I've remained with
FC Oedo and scored countless goals.

64
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,220

and the "command tower of group dates".

67
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,590
No, I think they're looking down on
you. What kind of ace is that?

68
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,660
During my prime, I scored countless
legendary goals. I'm a fantasista.

But today is different!

Today...I wanted to make my precious
little boy's wish come true!

You wanted to score a goal
today for your little boy?

That's right! That's what
I planned on doing.

But look what you've done!
Forget it, I'll just die!

over some of that Bocari! A big cup!

W-Wait! Wait! Just a minute!
There's no need to die!

83
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,950
Then what're you people
going to do about it?

84
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,270
Are you to going to take
responsibility for this?!

85

Gather up some people, do something!

Just set things up so we
can play the game!

If you don't...my little boy will...he'll...

All right, all right. I'll take care
of this. Give me some time.

Thanks for waiting.

91
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,360
It was rather sudden, but I think
I rounded you up quite a group.

98
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,890
We need Shinya, too.

You probably just read Captain Tsubasa.

I'm not Captain Tsubasa.
I'm Captain Katsura.

Who cares!

112
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,690
Excuse me, what're we doing?

113
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,930
It's been a long time since
I made an appearance.

114
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,340
I was asked to come to a contest where you
roll balls around without using your hands...

115
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,760
How freaky.

116
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,500
That's fine with me! Gin-san,
take out your balls.

117

Kojiro Hyuga from Captain Tsubara.]

119
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,390
What?

120
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,630
I heard we were doing a sport
that involved a lot of kicking,

121
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,220
[Note: Otae is wearing a Thai kickboxing outfit.]

122
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,220
so I came dressed like this.

123
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,610
What?!

124
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,580

watches all the cool things

125
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,600
you can do with your balls,
so I came like this.

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,210
What?! I heard the person who makes the
most unique Inari zushi was the winner,

127
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,210
[Note: Inari zushi is a tofu pouch packed
with rice. Looks like nuts.]

128
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,010

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,350
How're we going to play
soccer with this group?!

132
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:32,790
Gin-san, all of us together make
only ten. We're short one.

133
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,260
Huh? Is that so?

134
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,570
Don't just say "Is that so?" Soccer
is played with 11 people!

135
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,080
We're really in trouble
now! There's no time!

136
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,500
What're you going to do?! Come on!

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,360
There, we have everyone.

138
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,470
You just slapped this team together!

139

You sure this old geezer is any good?

140
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,240
Well at least he's not deaf.

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,880
Wait a minute, what's going
on, Amarao-san?

142
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,110
Huh?

143
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,640
The opposing team...

They all have the same face.

They were 11 kids born
at the same time.

What?!

147
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,380
Today's opponent is the
Oedo Ambivalence.

148

All positions are played by
the 11 Matsuno brothers.

149

I'd like to see their mother.

150
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,870
Amarao! Make sure you score today!

151
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,880
[Go, Go Amarao!]

152
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,770
Go! You're the night-on-the-town's
top scorer, right?

We're counting on you, Amarao!

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,770
At least look good in your last game!

155
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm finished.

156
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,290
There's no way we can play a decent
game with these amateurs.

157
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,860
Go for it! Amarao!

158
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,770
Could that be the little boy
he talked about earlier?

159
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,030
That's right...I mustn't give up.

160
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,150
No matter how inexperienced they are, with
proper directions, we might pull it off.

161
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,620
The game is about to begin.

162
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,350
I'm Nakano, and I'll be your
announcer for today.

163
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,400
The Oedo Ambivalence starts things off.

164
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,520
Sannan Matsuno dribbles and
slashes into the defense.

165
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,570
Defenders! Stay on your mark, man-to-man!
Don't let them move freely!

166
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,880
Gotcha!

167
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,230
I have my man!

168
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,700
I have mine!

169
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,710
Hey! You're guarding your
own teammates?!

170
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,250
Shut up! When you go after
the one you love...

171
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,310
You always go man-to-man!

172
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,550
Otae-san!

173
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,310
I won't let you go!

174
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,620
Now Sannan Matsuno...

175
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,640
makes a sharp pass towards the
goal right through the defense!

176
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
Clear! Just clear it!

177
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,120
Clear!

178
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,150
Shin-chan, I did it. I cleared two balls.

179
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,900
Sis! A girl shouldn't be
talking about two balls!

180
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,560
The ball is grabbed by Juichinan Matsuno.
He races toward the goal.

181
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,010
He's coming your way, goalkeeper!

182
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,020
Okay, I'll guard this side of the
line, and Elizabeth, you...

183
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,260
That's not fair! That side's
bigger than mine.

184
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,390
What're you talking about?
This boundary is absolute.

185
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,290
Hey! What're you setting territories for?!

186
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,220
What do you mean by absolute?!

187
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,340
I swear to God, they are absolute!

188
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,330
Why are there three goalkeepers?!

189
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,410
Okay, above the line's okay.

190
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,530
Above the line is still out of bounds! You're
gonna get penalized! Definitely penalized!

191
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,420
I dare you! I dare you to penalize me!

192
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,460
You get the death penalty!
Definitely the death penalty!

193
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,370
What?!

194
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,040
You'll definitely get five whacks!

195
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,960
What'd you do that for?!

196
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,940
Elizabeth...

197
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,110
[We should all share this space...]

198

199
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,450

You...

201

Elizabeth...

202
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,540
Okay, let's do this!

203
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,440
Right! We're teammates!

204
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,990
Teammates!

205
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,660
[That's right! That's right!]

206

Hey! Hey!

207
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,560
Goal!

208
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,120
The visiting Ambivalence scores first!

209
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,130
It's all right. We'll have
many more chances.

210
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,820
No, we won't.

211
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,000
Only you people here should hear this.

212
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,740
My body is a wreck from all my battles
on the field over the years.

213
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,690
These knees,

214
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,560
this back,

215
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,020
have all reached their
limits a long time ago.

216
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,410
I don't know how many more times I can
shoot for the goal with all my might.

217
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,940
That's why...!

218
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,630
I'm not asking for repeated chances!

219
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,930
One...just one shot is enough.
Give me one chance at a goal!

220
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,450
You say that, but we're amateurs...

221
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,270
But we'll do what we can.

222
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,140
Shin-chan, Kagura-chan.

223
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,820
Okay.

224
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,820
Right.

225
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,690
...Everyone...

226
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,300
The game continues with FC Oedo
in possession of the ball.

227
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm counting on you.

228
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,230
Oh... Having said that, we've
never played soccer before.

229
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,570
Sakata has it stolen away!

230
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,960
We don't have the guts!

231
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,570
[Note: Famous phrase from a Captain Tsubasa video
game. Displayed when Energy (guts) is low.]

232
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,980
This is going to be easy!
They're nothing but amateurs!

233
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,650
I'll increase our lead!

234
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,420
He shoots!

235
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,220
The ball is headed straight
towards the goal!

236
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,740
Elizabeth is their only goalkeeper!

237
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,610
After the last goal, it seems they decided who would
be the goalkeeper using rock-paper-scissors!

238
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,500
The ball is in the air. But will Elizabeth's
physique get in the way?!

239
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,540
It's a spectacular save!

240
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,810
Elizabeth makes a spectacular,
unexpected save!

241
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,060
Makes you wonder what
sort of creature it is!

242
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,050
The front line has raced deep into
the opponent's side of the field.

243
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,290
Goalkeeper! This is our chance
to counterattack!

244
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,060
Kick it out in front of their goal!

245
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,890
The goalkeeper makes a nice feed!

246
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,860
Amarao!

247
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,860
With this...

248
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,780
I can make his wish come true.

249
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,840
Damn! Why does this
have to happen now!

250
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,710
Are you okay, Amarao-san?

251
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,520
Don't worry! It's a badge of
honor I got during a game!

252
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,710
Yes...it was during a hard-fought
game like today!

[Cabaret Chic Hostess Bar]

254
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,360
C'mon, Ohana-chan, why won't
you go out with me?

255
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:47,130
What should I do? I'll consider it if you do
the Amarao Dance you do at the game.

256
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,450
Is that all? Okay, here goes.

Here comes the signature pose!

259

I never imagined that "game" would
force me into retirement.

From start to finish...

263
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,390
You totally got...

264
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,760
what you deserved!

265
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,230
It's your own stupid fault!

266
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,700
Shoot!

267
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,930
...not today...

268
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,980
That concludes the first half.

Hey! What're you doing?!

270

What, Shinpachi-kun? Balls
always go with bats, right?

271

Shut up! Can't you people even remember what
sport you were playing just a second ago?!

No. My memory went splat after
I got kicked in the balls.

Are your brains in your balls?!

your legs right now!

vulgar things such as bats, poles, and bleep.

to keep playing Captain Tsubasa!

we manage in the second half?

nothing but stupid things out there.

In the first half,

294
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,530
FC Oedo managed to keep the score
at 0-1 despite missing their regulars.

295
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,420
Can they catch up in the second half?

296
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,800

298
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,810
I'd forgotten. I always did things myself.

For my own sake, using
my own strength!

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,070
What happened to...

313
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,030
The match!

314
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,770
Ambivalence adds another point!

315
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,530
Looks like Amarao who was out with an
injury is coming back into the game.

316
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,030
Amarao-san...we're sorry.

317
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,000
No, I'm to blame for getting
you involved in this.

318
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,900
All we have left is stoppage time.

319
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,940
It's true that I did nothing but stupid
things during my soccer career.

320
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,700
That came back to haunt me today.

321
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,600
But I won't give up on scoring
a goal until the very end.

322
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,290
That's the sort of person a striker is.

323
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,730
During the time that's left, I'll score
a goal even if I have to do it alone.

324
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,650
My little boy...is waiting for a goal.

325
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,690
But isn't your back and knees a wreck?

326
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,380
They give me more of a chance
than relying on you amateurs.

327
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,380
You realize it now, don't you?
Soccer is not a game.

328
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,890
The field is a battleground.
Soccer is war!

329
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,630
War?!

330
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,020
What's so funny?!

331
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,790
Amarao-san, you son-of-a-gun.

332
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,540
All of us here are definitely
amateurs at soccer.

333
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,470
But, if it's war, we're talking about...

334
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,970
Everyone here is a battle-hardened pro.

335
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,060
Huh?

336
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,110
Just watch.

337
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,190
All that remains is stoppage time.

338
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,680
With the outcome already decided,

339
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,970
the only question is whether or not Amarao
will score a goal in his retirement match.

340
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,100
Amarao speeds in alone once again!

341
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,720
Tsk! That pain again...

342
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,080
The ball is taken away!

343
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,070
And it goes back...

344
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,300
the other way!

345
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,310
Crap!

346
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,090
Don't come here!

347
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,110
You go for a goal, nothing else!

348
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,410
We'll set you up!

349
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,830
You're not scoring any more points!

350
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,490
Fools! Amateurs shouldn't rush in!

351
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,230
You're wrong! He's not just any amateur!

352
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,930
He's...

353
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,020
Is that?! A foot soldier?!

354
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,830
One who rushes in with
no fear for his life?!

355
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,050
I'm used to diving in and
sacrificing myself!

356
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,780
He's just a foot soldier, after all.

357
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,900
Look closely!

358
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,580
The foot solder was a decoy!

359
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,830
The real defenders are the
spearmen behind him!

360
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,350
Let's do it, Otae-san!

361
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,930
That figure going after the ball
in mid-air has to be an archer!

362
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,670
Go! Sky Love Gorricane!

363
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,670
[Note: Parody of "Sky love Hurricane", special attack
by the Tachibana Brothers in Captain Tsubasa.]

364
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,640
Look out! There's a defender
in the path of the pass!

365
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
This one's mine!

366
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,350
Do you know...

367
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,480
who the fastest person on
a battlefield is?

368
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,590
It's...

369
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,180
the shinobi!

370
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,940
Shinpachi! Let's do this with a
back-and-forth pass attack.

371
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,420
Right.

372
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,650
Here's the pass!

373
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,090
Pass.

374
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,890
Pass.

375
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,760
What a combination!

376
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,660
It's the Takeda Cavalry! The strongest
during wartime Japan!

377
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,290
What?! I'm a horse?!

378
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,730
What're you guys doing?!

379
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,470
There's only Amarao left! Defend him!

380
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,060
What?!

381
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,790
Samurai-san, leave this guy
to me and go on ahead.

382
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,660
Score a goal for everyone.

383
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,780
Hey! You're way too cool!

384
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,420
Gin-chan!

385
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,340
Go, Amarao!

386
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,080
Score!

387
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,790
[Go!]

388
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,990
For the sake of your little boy!

389
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,300
Thank you, everyone...

390
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,140
And...!

391
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,380
Amarao!

392
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,540
Ohana-chan!

393
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,870
What?!

394
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,280
Go out with me for the
sake of my "little boy"!

395
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,880
Shoot!

396
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,800
I-It...snapped...

397
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,270
And that's the end of the game!

398
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,350
C'mon, let's go home.

399
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,040
Daddy!

400
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:55,130
Strikers are beasts that
live to score goals.

401
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,810
The next episode... "Kids Don't Understand
How Their Parents Feel."

402
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:35,490
[The Odd Jobs are summoned to a splendid mansion owned
by their client Kaguzo Mashiroi, boss of the Mashiroi Gang.]

403
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,990
[His son, Utsuzo, had become reclusive. Can
Gin-san and friends coax him out of his shell?]
