157
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,930
Hanako-chan, do you know what your dream is?

158
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,130
To get my money back from a phony relig-

159
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:29,430
My dream is to eat a bowl of rice covered with a whole jar of seaweed tsukudani.

160
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:29,430
[NOTE: Tsukudani is seafood or meat that has been boiled in soy sauce]

161
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,580
But if it comes true, I won't have anything to dream about, so forget it!!

162
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,900
Is that so?

163
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,880
You probably want better eyesight. I don't need to ask you.

164
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,390
Hey. Ask me!!

165
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,630
What's your dream?

166
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,840
Dreams? I threw that kiddie crap away a long time ago.

167
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,750
Then why did you come here?

168
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,370
Look, I'm not gonna fake it, okay?

169
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,870
How about silky hair or something?

170
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,340
Sure, I'll go with that.

171
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,260
Get out of here!!

172
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,890
Those are the lamest dreams I've ever heard of! What are you after?

173
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,010
Are you really believers?

174
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,580
Maybe I still need to be convinced. I hear you've got the power to grant dreams.

175
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,590
I wanted to see it with my eyes.

176
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,170
Gin-san!! Aren't you forgetting why we're here?

177
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,070
Wait. Before we get her money back, shouldn't we reveal what he truly is?

178
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,000
Who are you?

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,200
We won't let you make fun of Tomu-sama!!

180
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,170
Get out! Get out!

181
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,670
How amusing... You want to see my power?

182
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,040
This is a utopia where dreams come true.

183
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,150
If you train here, I'll teach you... How to gain the power to grant dreams like I can.

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:55,780
Dream Catcher!!

185
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,840
What are you doing?

186
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,170
You said your dream is to have silky hair, right? Take a look at your head.

187
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,840
I-Impossible. Gin-san's naturally wavy hair has...

188
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,310
Become silky!!

189
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,390
Your hairstyle has even changed, too!

190
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,790
Really? You're joking, right? Hey.

191
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,320
Wow!

192
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,900
It's all silky!!

193
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,360
It doesn't stick together or fly away!

194
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,770
Yahoo!! Now it won't get tangled on rainy days!!

195
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,980
Before you start celebrating, grieve over that hair style!!

196
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,060
Now do you see? This is the Dream Catcher!!

197
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,110
Those who believe in the Dream Faith can gain this power.

198
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,710
The power to grant everyone's dreams.

199
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,870
What's the meaning of this?

200
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,000
There must be some sort of trick to it.

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,250
Right, Gin-san?

202
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,050
I am yours to command, Ham-sama.

203
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,090
It's not Ham, it's Tomu.

204
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,350
Hey!

205
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,790
I don't like this kind of Gin-san. Get a grip, Gin-chan.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,270
You...

207
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,810
Give us back the old Gin-chan.

208
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,820
What are you talking about? This is my true self.

209
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,550
An evil priest put a curse on me that made my hair ugly and naturally wavy.

210
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,020
Don't say that! Have confidence in yourself.

211
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,090
What are you without your naturally wavy hair?!

212
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,620
Young lady, your dream was to have a bowl of rice with a mountain of seaweed tsukudani on it, wasn't it?

213
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,520
Okay, okay.

214
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:35,760
Dream Catcher!!

215
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,630
Whoa!! It really appeared!!

216
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,570
I am yours to command, Ham Man.

217
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,900
What do you mean "ham man"? I told you, I'm Tomu.

218
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,010
He got her too! And so easily!!

219
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:55,250
Everyone, let's celebrate. We have new members!!

220
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,750
Let's achieve our dreams and be happy!!

221
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,190
Praise the Dream Faith!!

222
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,710
Praise the Dream Faith!!

223
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,570
Praise the Dream Faith!!

224
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,570
Dureammmm...

225
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,130
Catcha!!

226
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,360
Not like that!!

227
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,880
You focus too much on the pronunciation. You're not putting any feeling into it.

228
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,610
Feeling? All right. I think I can do it now.

229
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,700
Die, ugly!!

230
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,390
Hey, those feelings are of murderous intent! What are you doing?

231
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,770
They've forgotten why we're here and have completely fallen into their trap.

232
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,630
These are my feelings towards you. Please accept them.

233
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,790
Leave those idiots.

234
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,790
Keep them to yourself!

235
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,220
Anyway, I'm beginning to understand why he has so many followers.

236
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,530
They were shown that... I wonder how he did it.

237
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,690
Shin-chan, we didn't come here to prove that he's a fraud or anything.

238
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,270
If you forget what we came here to do,

239
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,410
you'll end up like those idiots.

240
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,590
You're right.

241
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,240
We've got to get Hanako-san's money back from that phony religious leader and put Hanako-san at ease.

242
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,920
No.

243
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,970
We're here so we can extort money from that phony religious leader and rebuild our father's dojo.

244
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,590
What? I I don't remember agreeing to that objective!!

245
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,790
When did that become the plan?!

246
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,800
Are you planning on taking money that was tricked out of the hands

247
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,370
of good people for your own selfish purposes?

248
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,000
There's nothing wrong with receiving a little reward money.

249
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,750
We're going to save the rest of the money.

250
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,800
You're taking all of it!!

251
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,530
You planned on doing that from the start.

252
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,070
Don't make me sound like a crook. I plan on getting back Hanako-chan's money.

253
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,910
Oh, come to think of it, where's Hanako-chan?

254
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,690
Dream Catcher!

255
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,150
Honestly...

256
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,940
How any times do you have to be duped for you to learn?

257
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,230
Come on, take us to Jam's room.

258
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,470
Sis, it's Tomu.

259
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,160
No, it's Tim... Huh? I'm not sure anymore...

260
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,130
What do you plan to do, Otae-chan?

261
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,450
We shouldn't stay here long. Let's go after the safe in Timroth's room.

262
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,540
Who's Timroth? That doesn't even resemble his name anymore!

263
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,970
Cracking his safe? That's like stealing. I won't do it!

264
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,210
Hanako-chan, where did you get those clothes?

265
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,850
Oh well. I'll do it for my dream!

266
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,520
Hanako-chan, try not to stand out too much.

267
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,270
Hanako-chan, go back to Osaka already.

268
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,260
Honestly, what fools they all are.

269
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,330
They can't even figure out such a simple trick...

270
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,260
Are they blind?

271
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,690
Dreams make people blind.

272
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,600
Thanks to that, I make quite a killing. I can't quit being a religious leader now.

273
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,720
This is all thanks to your power.

274
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,570
Why don't you come down from time to time and have a drink with me?

275
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,470
Hey, you're up there, aren't you?

276
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,050
Owowow...

277
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,780
Hey. Hanako-chan, you were struggling too much.

278
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,520
What are you doing?

279
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,630
Owowowow.

280
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,940
Oh no. I'm going to go bald!! Bald!

281
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:09,620
Ah, that hurt. Figures he'd use real glue on it. But how did he do that so fast?

282
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,970
Gin-chan.

283
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,590
You really look better like that.

284
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,450
Hey, this is the men's bathroom.

285
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:20,680
So it really was a trick. I thought you had completely fallen for it.

286
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,170
You thought I would believe that?

287
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,690
I was going to destroy this place, so I was checking it out.

288
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,180
M-Me, too. I acted like I was tricked, so I could check it out.

289
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,770
Tsukudani would never convince me.

290
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

291
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,070
It's true. As proof, I dug up some information on Tomu.

292
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,070
Oh?

293
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,470
Tomu's done the same demonstration as he did with us in front of his followers many times.

294
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,740
But it's only been pathetic dreams like curing baldness or getting a knock-off Louis Vuitton handbag.

295
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,150
He's been granting dreams that are easily attainable.

296
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,370
He can prepare for anything by asking his believers what their dreams are ahead of time...

297
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,950
But the problem is how he was able to make my wig and your food appear out of nowhere.

298
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,020
Someone so fast they can't be seen... It can't be.

299
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,900
A ninja.

300
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,570
I saw it on TV.

301
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,060
That's so cliché...

302
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:18,530
Owowowow. Ow. This is bad. Blood came out again.

303
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,440
I clenched too hard. Owowow...

304
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,210
Gin-san, Kagura-chan!!

305
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,080
Shinpachi, what's wrong?

306
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,030
You need to take a dump? Is it gonna be a photo-finish?

307
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,160
Bad news. It's my sister and Hanako-chan!!

308
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,700
Everyone, I have an unfortunate announcement. We had a traitors in our midst.

309
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,600
They snuck into my room and tried to steal your offerings.

310
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,940
Do you think this is forgivable?!

311
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,910
Never!! Die!

312
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,860
Everyone, open your eyes. You're all being tricked by this man...

313
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,690
You bastard! You threw a rock at me. I'll remember your face!! I'll kill you afterwards!!

314
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:11,000
I will leave the punishment of these traitors to you!

315
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,400
Dream Catcher holds the power to grant wishes!!

316
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,620
Everyone, wish intently for the sort of punishment you want them to receive.

317
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,990
Ow! Hey, that hurts!!

318
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,910
And, these criminals will get the punishment they deserve without us lifting our own hands against them!

319
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,380
Ow! My eye!!

320
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,410
Punishment?! Just kill them.

321
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,770
That's right. Kill them!!

322
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,160
Kill, kill, kill, kill...

323
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,490
It's decided. You will be punished with death.

324
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,070
Just try it, faker... If you think you can...

325
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,970
You just talk about dreams and wishes, but you don't do anything.

326
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,990
You're all such naïve people.

327
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,150
Otae-chan...

328
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,330
You think you have any power over us?

329
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,020
You have no proof. Where do you get such confidence at a time like this?

330
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,580
We believe in something far more powerful than you!

331
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,580
What could be more powerful than dreams?

332
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,210
That would be...

333
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,870
our friends.

334
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,930
What's that?!

335
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,550
There's someone on the roof!

336
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,260
Wh-What? Where?!

337
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,320
Gin-chan!! Over there!!

338
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,660
Dream Catcher!

339
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,330
Unveiled!

340
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,600
Oh! A ninja!

341
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,110
What's this? Someone fell from the beams!!

342
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,910
Hey! Hattori-san! Get back up there! What am I paying you for?

343
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,620
I-I can't... S-Something jabbed me in the butt.

344
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,700
Stop fooling around.

345
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:52,060
[NOTE: The Oniwabanshu was a group of ninjas formed by Yoshimune Tokugawa.]

346
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,450
I picked you up off the streets after the Oniwabanshu downsized you.

347
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,030
Without you, I'm just a man.

348
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,060
Sorry. I'm quitting.

349
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,140
The toilets here aren't bidet toilets. My butt can't take it anymore.

350
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,430
Later!!

351
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,600
Hey!

352
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,100
I-It's a ninja.

353
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,380
Why does Tomu-sama have a ninja?

354
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,550
You still don't get it?

355
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,610
This is the truth behind the Dream Catcher.

356
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:14,350
Think back. Did he ever make a dream come true that wasn't simple and concrete things?

357
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,360
He pre-interviewed all his converts and chose only dreams that were easy to grant.

358
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,930
He kept a ninja hidden in the beams and acted as if he was performing miracles at swift speeds.

359
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,100
You were tricked.

360
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,390
Impossible. We would never fall for such a silly trick.

361
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,850
That's right. I was bald, but now I have a head of hair.

362
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,360
Hey, this is a toupee!

363
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,700
It's true. Why didn't you notice it before?

364
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,610
Well, I didn't touch it 'cause I didn't want my new hair to fall out!

365
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,560
Hey, Tomu! You bastard!! How dare you trick us!!

366
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,620
Give us back our money!!

367
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,040
Where are you going, Guru?

368
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,160
Why don't you use your Dream Catcher for something like this.

369
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,330
Pray to your hairy mole for help!!

370
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,710
Like us, he was a pathetic man who was couldn't see anything because he was absorbed in his dream.

371
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,500
Yes. But the only thing different was you had people to help you.

372
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,260
It's all about whether you have friends or not, isn't it?

373
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,990
If I get like that, help me out, okay, Hanako-chan?

374
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,100
Of course. Next time, I'll show you Osaka's kindheartedness.

375
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,530
D-D-Dream Catcha...

376
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,710
Please let me win big at pachinko...

377
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,690
What are you doing, Gin-san?

379
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,710
Gin-chan, I want to eat a steamed pork bun!

380
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,330
I don't have any. Go ask Santa for one.

381
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,600
You can't fool me.

382
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,020
Even Yuming is singing there's no Santa!

383
