Scared of what?

123
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,310
Was there something scary
about the dentist?

No, not really.

Nothing at all.

You said that because there's
something to be scared of.

come in to get plaque removed
on a regular basis.

What? You don't do that?

135

I have the whole package
done every three days.

136

don't get that drill in there.

doing here together?

You guys are also having
teeth problems?

157
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,870
I was taking a walk and decided
to stop by for a drilling.

158
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,610
A drill? What are you talking about?

159
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,350
Are you also here for a drilling?

160
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,660
A drilling? Well, I'm here to get treated.

161
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,420
I just stepped out for a bathroom break.

162

But man...

163

O-Oh, really...

165
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,620
I hate those month-long treatments that require
you to keep going back to the dentist.

166
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,760
I heard that they did it in one shot here.

167
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,240
Sure, they're fast, but it hurts.

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,110
I felt like screaming so many times.

169
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,310
Hasegawa-san!

170
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,640
Are you finished?

171
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,630
Oh, sorry! I'm on my way.

172
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,050
I'll be going then.

173
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,810
You'd better prepare yourselves.

174
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,040
I-I see...

175
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,270
It hurts...

176
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,880
W-Well, dental treatments are
supposed to hurt.

177
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,180
Th-That's right...

178
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,770
To the point where you wonder
if it worked if it didn't hurt.

179
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,500
Hmm? You look a little pale?

180
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,660
Not at all.

181
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,250
Hasegawa-san, don't struggle!

182
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,660
It's dangerous so you have to stay still!

183
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,430
Hold Hasegawa-san down.

184
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,950
Tie him down to the seat.

185
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,720
Ah, yes. Like that.

186
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,000
Doesn't this sound a little too painful?

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,420
What kind of treatment is this?!

188
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,500
Doctor! Hasegawa-san's pulse!

189
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,200
Perform CPR. If it doesn't work,
bring out the defibrillator.

190
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,150
Defibrillator?!

191
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,660
Why would a dentist need that?!

192
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,640
Doctor! His pulse is back,

193
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,260
but the shock threw "that" loose!

194
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,130
Threw "that" loose?!

195
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,930
What's "that"?! What's loose?!

196
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,550
Oh, it's okay. We won't
be using that again.

197
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,500
Dip it in the ponzu sauce.

198
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,700
[Note: Ponzu sauce is a citrus based sauce
often used as dip for shabu-shabu.]

199
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,250
Dip it in the ponzu sauce?!

200
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,210
What are they doing?!

201
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,700
Wouldn't this go better
with sesame sauce, Doc?

202
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,650
Sesame sauce?!

203
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,600
Are they having shabu-shabu?!

204
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,940
They're having shabu-shabu, right?!

205
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,800
Okay, that should do it.

206
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,660
It's over?!

207
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,250
They finished it with a ponzu sauce?!

208
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,250
How do you feel, Hasegawa-san?

209
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,040
Man, it's like the pain's completely gone.

210
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,760
Not just your pain, but like a part
of your body's also gone!

211
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,460
It's been dunked in ponzu sauce!

212
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,630
You'll be able to eat anything you
want now, just like before.

213
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,460
Man... Thank you very much, Doc.

214
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,880
We've included some painkillers and
a toothbrush specially made by us.

215
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,400
Thanks for being so considerate.

216
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,920
Take care now.

217
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,560
Thank you very much!

218
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,100
Man, I'm completely better now.

219
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,430
It was damn painful, but the
dentist was pretty good.

220
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,110
Look, they even included a toothbrush!

221
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,130
Included as in literally included?!

222
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,310
Wait!

223
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,610
Your teeth are fine now, but you lost
something more important instead?!

224
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,340
That's way beyond an
equivalent exchange!

225
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,900
You should come in for a new toothbrush
if the bristles wear out.

226
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,770
May I say something...?

227
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,300
Yeah! Speak your mind! Sue them!

228
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,960
That's one crazy quack!

229
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,770
I need a hard toothbrush
to get the job done.

230
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,440
That's not the issue here!

231
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,750
Yes, no problem.

232
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,490
We included a hard toothbrush
on your crotch to be safe.

233
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,610
It'll get hard when you play around with it.

234
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,260
That's not the point!!

235
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,190
How are you supposed to
brush your teeth with it?!

236
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,860
Only your wife can reach down
there to brush with it!

237
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,940
Well, you take care now.

238
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,910
Oh, it's Toshi!

239
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,820
You guys are also here to get treated?

240
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,990
Kondo-san...

241
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,350
Man, this dentist does good work!

242
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,890
I'm completely better now!

243
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,960
They even included an...

244
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,290
electric toothbrush.

245
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,880
Electric toothbrush...?

246
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,170
Isn't that Hasegawa-san's arm?

247
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,800
Well, it smells like ponzu sauce,
but it's pretty useful.

248
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,710
Hey! It's obviously Hasegawa-san's!

249
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,430
Really? I don't like the idea of
letting machines do the work.

250
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,980
You have to brush your teeth
with your own hands.

251
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,480
Yeah, that'd be your hand right there.

252
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,930
And hasn't your hand been
replaced by a toothbrush?

253
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,080
If Hasega...

254
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,100
The electric toothbrush starts to rot,
please come in to get it replaced.

255
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,230
She was about to say Hasegawa-san's
arm, wasn't she?!

256
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,850
Excuse me...

257
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,020
I'm having a hard time getting
the brush to reach my mouth.

258
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,170
Is that okay?

259
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,220
It's fine.

260
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,490
If it doesn't reach, use a toothbrush in
your own hand to brush your teeth.

261
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,060
Why'd you include the arm then?!

262
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,920
That's just harassment!

263
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,110
Take care now, you two.

264
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,590
Take care, my ass!

265
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,320
Why don't you take care
of your patients first?!

266
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,270
This isn't dental care. They're
modifying your body!

267
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,550
This dentist is crazy!

268
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,010
It's way too insane!

269
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,810
H-Hey...

270
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,480
What are you doing? Get outta here!

271
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,040
This is no dental clinic.

272
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,310
[Note: An Evil organization from the Kamen Rider series. Shocker performs modification operations that gives the subject superhuman fighting abilities.]

273
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,920
It's Shocker HQ.

274
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,990
Stop being stubborn and scram.

275
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,310
Hey, what are you doing?

276
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,300
Go home, please!

277
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,610
I'll give you 300 yen.

278
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,420
What's wrong with this guy?
Why doesn't he run?

279
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,680
Get a clue!

280
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,010
I can't leave until you do, fool!

281
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,560
Could the next patients
please step inside.

282
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,960
Two at a time.

283
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,210
No way. You're kidding.

284
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,710
Are we seriously going?

285
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,270
Well, let's see how deep
that drill will go this time.

286
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,540
Will it reach my soul?

287
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,360
No! I don't wanna go!

288
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,520
How would a drill reach my soul?!

289
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,290
I have no idea what I'm saying!

290
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,870
Why do people dig?

291
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,960
Because they have drills.

292
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,420
What was that?!

293
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,260
Am I an idiot?! An idiot?!

294
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,450
Stop pretending to be
a man and run for it!

295
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,260
Hey! Somebody!

296
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,240
Anybody!

297
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,000
Stop us!!

298
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,030
Hello.

299
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,290
I'm Yabuta of the Namu dental clinic.

300
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,330
Sakata-san and Hijikata-san, right?

301
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,820
I'll be taking care of you today.

302
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,120
Don't be so nervous.

303
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,610
It won't hurt.

304
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,520
Well, just relax. C'mon, relax.

305
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,210
A-A crime scene?!

306
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,800
Is a dental operation room supposed
to be this red?

307
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,100
Wasn't it supposed to be whiter?

308
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,240
All spic-and-span?

309
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,280
Was dental care always so bloody?

310
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,640
Weren't the instruments more compact?

311
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,080
Was there a chainsaw involved?

312
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,960
Is this how going to the dentist was like?!

313
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,210
Well, you've both got
some swollen faces.

314
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,800
Why did you leave it alone so long?

315
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,860
That's no good.

316
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,970
The mouth is like the
entrance to a human.

317
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,530
Also the first step to
getting to know a person.

318
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,250
You can judge a person by their teeth.

319
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,050
Yeah, most people with
dirty teeth are slobs.

320
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,470
People who keep their teeth clean
probably listened to their parents.

321
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,560
Yep, that's why I always tell my
young patients the following.

322
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,150
When you go on a group date, looks
and personality don't matter.

323
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,790
Check their boobs first.

324
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,500
Doc, the door to your entrance
has fallen off its hinges...

325
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,710
You can judge a person
after seeing their boobs.

326
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,210
This Doc is terrible!

327
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:34,300
Women with big areolae on their breasts have big
hearts that are more forgiving of adultery.

328
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,210
He's talking about boobs!

329
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,840
The door's fallen loose,

330
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,390
and there's a toilet-like smell coming out!

331
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,680
Like Niwa-kun's place where you go
in the door and it smells like a toilet!

332
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,450
The toilet is his entrance!

333
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,640
And women with small areolae on
their breasts tend to be smothering.

334
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,010
You've gotta be careful.

335
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,360
Nobody would want to smother you!

336
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,640
Areolae are the key to women.

337
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,730
Nothing else matters.

338
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,700
What kind of a group date would involve
looking at their areolae?!

339
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,500
What kind of group date did you go to?!

340
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,180
Okay...

341

Let's get down to business.

342
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll have an assistant take
a quick look at you.

343
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,220
Well, it's possible that my assistants
will be able to take care of you.

344
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,970
G-Good... He's not doing the treatment.

Hey! You two!

Yes!

Yes.

Fairy Shazzan-san.

349

Nakayama-san!

Definitely Nakayama-san!

Anybody but Shazzan-san!

Which one do you like?

355
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,610
I prefer the one with black hair.

And what the hell is that?

357

Why is Battle Fairy Shazzan
working in a dental clinic?!

What the hell is Battle Fairy Shazzan?!

Which do you want to look at you?

360

363
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,910
Then Sakata-san will
have Nakayama-san.

The name's Nakayama.

369

I'll be taking care of you, Sakata-san.

Battle Fairy Shazzan!

You're obviously not Nakayama-san!

Fairy Shazzan-san.

So Nakayama-san and Shazzan-san
are both battle fairies?!

385
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,280
Then, we shall explain this clinic's system
before we commence treatment.

386
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,300
Before you do that, explain how you've
ended up as battle fairies!

387
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,710
Our clinic will treat your dental maladies,

388
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,180
and also provide operating services
to prevent any future cavities.

389
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,110
That's way beyond a dentist's job!

390
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,290
Then we'll move on to an explanation
of your options.

391
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,670
Option A provides treatment of your cavity
and surgery to modify your body.

392
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,550
Option B provides surgery to modify
your body and comes with free drinks.

393
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,210
Option B has nothing to do with my teeth!

394
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,550
Why are there free drinks?!

395
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,830
Uh, excuse me.

396
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,720
Isn't there an option that skips the surgery
and gets my cavity treated?

397
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,210
You'll save money by choosing Option A instead
of getting the treatment and surgery separately.

398
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,650
No, I don't want the surgery.

399
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,240
I just want to get this cavity treated!

400
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,570
Then I would recommend
either Option Z or X.

401
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,780
What are those?

402
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,320
Option Z includes a massage when
you get your cavity treated.

403
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,620
Option X includes a salad bar
when you get treatment.

404
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,550
A-Ah, then I'll take Option Z.

405
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,350
With the massage?

406
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,340
Yea, whatever. That'll do.

408
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,130

I'm Betty. I'll be taking care of you, boss.

I ended up getting modified!

412

And this has nothing to do
with preventing cavities!

This thing has no intention
of doing its job!

Couldn't they give me a higher
quality girl at least?!

Allow me to explain.

416
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,470
Pleasure Fort Betty and Sakata-san
have been neurologically connected,

417
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,230
which means that the robot
Pleasure Fort Betty

418
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,400
appears as an actual massage
girl to Sakata-san.

carefully from the battle fairy deal.

00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,340
This isn't my fault.

486
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
[In Actuality]

487
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,140
Yeah, I have nothing to do with this!

488
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,660
Huh? What is this?

489
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,290
I've got this weird image in my mind.

490
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,930
Hey! What is this?

491
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,500
Like my life is flashing before my eyes?

492
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,750
Or is this Betty's life?

493
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,580
And what's with the fake memories?!

494
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,370
I don't remember anything
like that happening!

495
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,060
Stop! Don't show me that creepy stuff!

496
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,380
I didn't do anything wrong!

497
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,500
This has nothing to do with me!

498
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,250
I'm the one who was modified
and getting screwed!

499
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,920
Huh? What is this?

500
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,560
Strange images are flowing
into my mind.

501
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,670
Hey, are these flashbacks...?

502
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,560
The salad old lady's life is
flashing before my eyes?!

503
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,870
And she has no actual memories!

504
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,860
It's all about vegetables!

505
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,590
Are you okay with this?!

506
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,960
Dying without any decent memories...

507
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,950
No, I want to get my cavity treated.

508
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,770
I don't give a damn about
a salad old lady!

509
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,280
It's not my fault! It's not my
fault! It's not my fault!

510
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,420
It's not my fault! It's not my
fault! It's not my fault!

511
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,500
Yeah!

512
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,260
We didn't do anything...

513
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,030
WROOOOOONG!!

514
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,600
Um, excuse me.

515
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
This isn't a dental clinic.

516
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,750
I know.

517
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,700
Well, you obviously have cavities.

518
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,270
You should go see a dentist.

519
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,270
We don't care about the cavities.

520
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,130
It'll rot and fall out soon enough.

521
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,010
Then why are you here?

522
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,950
Please fix her...

523
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:17,010
[Preview]

524
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,950
Okay, people.

525
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,150
Clean out your ears and listen good!

526
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,100
Okay!
Will do!

527
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,190
Next time on GinTama the anime...
"Countdown Begins"!

528
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,010
Huh? Why isn't there any reaction?

529
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,140
Come on...

530
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,020
["Countdown Begins"]

531
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,790
We're not falling for that again.

532
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:29,990
[The countdown finally begins
for GinTama the anime.]

533
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,190
[See you next time.]
