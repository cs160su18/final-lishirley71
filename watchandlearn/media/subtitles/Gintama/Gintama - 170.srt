2
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,530
As I said...

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,430
The systems of this world
are under our control.

4
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,140
Defeating me will destroy this world.

5
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,380
Will you still attempt to defeat me?

6
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,390
Can you kill Tama?

7
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,910
[Note: Original text, "Begirama" is a spell
from the game Dragon Quest series.]

8
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,910
Firebane!!

9
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,140
["And Into the Legend..."]

10
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,550
Ow, ow, ow...

11
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,940
Wait! Hold on! Time-out!

12
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,770
No, wait! Wait!

13
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,060
Weren't you listening to what
I was saying?! Open!

14
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,370
Huh? Something about offering
us half of the world?

15
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,800
And it doesn't matter if we pick yes or no
because we still end up fighting, right?

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,780
Forget it. Too much of a hassle.

17
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,330
Wouldn't that be the Dragonlord?

18
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,510
He didn't listen to a single word I said.

19
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,230
The Archfiend always talks too much.

20
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,420
I usually just skim through.

21
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,800
What do you think you're doing?!

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,250
Any damage to the Archfiend Tapir
will mean damage to Lady Tama!

23
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,180
Aren't you capable of exercising discretion?!

24
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,910
Uh, you realize you just
indirectly attacked her?!

25
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,310
The Archfiend is completely beat-up?!

26
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,810
What do you think you're doing?!

27
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,430
Get out of my way. Scram!

28
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,340
You scram!

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,450
Hey!

30
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,940
What are you doing in
front of the Archfiend?!

31
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,730
Curse you...

32
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,130
So you do not care if this
body is destroyed?

33
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,010
Heartless bastards...

34
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,810
And you call yourself heroes?!

35
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,450
Like the Archfiend's in
any position to talk!

36
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,000
I can now see that you are big douches.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,050
But will you be able to continue
after seeing this?

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,700
Leukocyte King, do you remember
your father's face?

39
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,050
Yes, your father, the previous
king, Fortega,

40
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,490
fell into the anus during
his battle with me

41
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,610
and lost his life.

42
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,120
But what would you do if
Fortega were still alive?

43
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:38,650
What would you do if he still lived in pain
within me after being consumed?

44
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,010
It can't be...

45
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,540
You couldn't have...

46
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,240
Yes, exactly...

47
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,200
My son...

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,970
Father!

49
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,000
Hey, wait! Hold up!

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,560
You move too fast!

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,690
I didn't even get a chance
to reveal his father's face!

52
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,860
I was still talking!

53
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,600
And why is everybody
hitting me this time?!

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,170
We don't feel a thing when you
use the "I'm your father" setting.

55
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,830
This is much easier than beating Tama-san's face,
so I figured I'd use this chance to finish you.

56
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,100
Don't you people have any respect for this
tragic meeting between father and son?!

57
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,160
Nobody uses "the last boss is
your father" twist anymore.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,050
Come up with something better.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
Curses!

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,980
I pulled the plug and we lost our
connection to the system!

61
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,700
Plug?!

62
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,620
You people were controlling the system
with such a half-assed method?!

63
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,710
This is it!

64
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,720
Now that he's disconnected
from Lady Tama's system,

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,950
we can defeat the Archfiend Tapir
without harming Lady Tama!

66
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,400
This is our only chance!

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,150
Let's go!

68
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,220
Don't underestimate me, brats!

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,890
Your cheap appliance store security
measures can't possibly defeat me

70
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:00,460
after I've consumed high-level technology
and undergone an extreme evolution!

71
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,690
I can no longer be considered a virus.

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,990
I have transcended human
understanding...

73
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,770
Yes...

74
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,430
A god!

75
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,030
A being you humans cannot cope with...

76
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,880
A perfect being known as a god!

77
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,500
A god...?

78
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,500
God schmod.

79
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,380
You're supposed to be fighting
it out with some

80
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,980
yeast cells on a rotten piece
of bread, Germfiend.

81
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,770
This isn't where you belong.

82
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,530
Get the hell outta Tama-san.

83
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,510
We won't allow you to contaminate
our friend any further.

84
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,330
This will be the last clean-up job!

85
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,350
Let's go, guys!

86
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,710
Yeah!

87
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,480
Huh?

88
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,110
My body won't move the way I want it to.

89
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,850
Huh? Huh?

90
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,610
What's with Kagura?!

91
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,910
Wh-Wh-Why?!

92
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,340
Why did Kagura-chan turn into pixels?!

93
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,800
Wh-What's going on here?

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,410
Don't tell me Kagura got
infected by the virus?

95
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,960
That can't be it...

96
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,300
How could a human being be
infected by a computer virus...

97
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,090
As I said...

98
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,510
I am no longer a pathetic computer virus!

99
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,050
Shinpachi!

100
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,260
Shinpachi! You okay?!

101
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,940
Somehow...

102
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,340
Shrunk

103
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,110
down...

104
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,990
M-M-My legs are short!

105
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,200
Looks like you're okay.

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,310
Like hell I am!

107
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,600
My body's over here!

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,950
And my legs are like this!

109
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,500
Why was my transformation
so half-assed?!

110
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,780
I'd take a full body change over this!

111
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,100
Huh? Something changed?

112
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,140
[Note: Guntank is a weapon from
the anime series Gundam.]

113
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,640
Didn't your body always
look like a Guntank?

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,140
Who are you calling a Guntank?!

115
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,830
G-Gin-chan...

116
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,650
It's like... my body's like stone...
I can't move...

117
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,270
Hey, Kagura! Hang in there!

118
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,300
What is this?

119
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,210
The pixels are advancing!

120
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,420
My body's getting heavier
and heavier, Gin-san!

121
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,250
Shinpachi!

122
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,740
Help... Gin-chan...

123
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,330
Kagura!

124
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,250
Gin-san! Do something!

125
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,010
Shintank!

126
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,550
Who's that supposed to be?!

127
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,510
Gin-chan...

128
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,470
M-My body is...

129
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,220
Why are you standing around?

130
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,990
Do you want to die?

131
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,090
They're...

132
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:19,760
It's no use.

133
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,090
They've been completely pixilated.

134
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,250
We need to retreat for now!

135
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,520
Kagura! Shintank!

136
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,590
I won't let you get away!

137
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,260
It appears that he wasn't lying about having
more power than a normal virus.

138
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:42,410
His extreme evolution has given
him the power to control viruses,

139
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,490
which affect human beings
in addition to us programs.

140
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,850
You've gotta be kidding.

141
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,520
I've heard of an animator, who didn't take a bath
for so long that he had fungus on his penis,

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,610
but I've never heard of anyone getting
infected by a computer virus!

143
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,770
It appears that you're running out of time.

144
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,800
Your entire body will eventually
become pixels.

145
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,200
Why?!

146
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,800
Why is enemy fire always
concentrated here?!

147
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,980
Because I haven't used
it for a long time?!

148
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,050
You upset?!

149
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,010
I'm the one who's upset, moron!

150
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,460
Is my penis going to get better?!

151
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,870
Will Shinpachi and Kagura
ever recover?!

152
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,640
Just stay there.

153
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,200
I'll handle the rest.

154
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,160
You and your friends...

155
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,750
Hey! Wait!

156
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,310
I told you to stay there.

157
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,820
Who's going to protect
Lady Tama if you die?

158
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,620
How sad do you think Lady Tama
will be if you die here?

159
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,090
I was created for the sole purpose
of protecting Lady Tama.

160
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,670
I have nothing else to protect.

161
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,640
I am merely your substitute.

162
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,600
I should be the only one who
has to die for Lady Tama!

163
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,520
Forget...about...me...

164
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:12,520
At least try...to release...
him...from this...place...

165
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,360
Tama said the same thing to me.

166
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,870
She told me to forget about
her and protect you.

167
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,670
To release you from this place.

168
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,000
That's why I told her,

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,320
if you were really a copy of me,

170
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,870
you would never want that.

171
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,250
Even if you died, you'd never dream of running
away and leaving you in charge behind.

172
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,030
Guess I overestimated you.

173
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,830
You're dumping what's important off on
someone else and stepping down?

174
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,870
I am your copy.

175
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,400
It doesn't matter if I die. As long as
you live, more copies can be made.

176
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,790
I don't remember having
such a pathetic copy.

177
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,710
You wouldn't have a chance
of taking my place.

178
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,010
And I absolutely refuse to take yours.

179
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,230
Nobody can take anybody's place.

180
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,600
There isn't a person in this world
that could take your place.

181
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,360
It doesn't matter if you were based
on me or have the same face.

182
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:30,950
You're the one who's devoted yourself to
protecting Tama this whole time, not me.

183
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,860
As far as Tama's concerned,
you're no copy or substitute.

184
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,700
You're someone who's always
been there for her...

185
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,180
A precious, irreplaceable friend...

186
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,900
If you truly care about Tama,

187
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,920
never talk about dying again.

188
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,470
Never call yourself a substitute again.

189
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,790
I'm done fighting with you.

190
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,680
Let's survive and have a
drink together, brother.

191
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,430
I have no interested in fermented juice.

192
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,530
[Note: Delicious Water from Rokkou is a brand
name of mineral water from House Foods.]

193
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,530
It's a different story if you have
Delicious Water from Rokkou, brother!

194
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,540
Got it?

195
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,460
If we don't stop him here,

196
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,020
Lady Tama won't be his only victim.

197
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,750
The viruses will invade your entire world.

198
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,950
We have no time.

199
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,520
We have to stop him before your
entire body turns into pixels!

200
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,520
The two of us will end
this once and for all!

201
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,040
Foolish brats...

202
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,150
I see you're finally ready to die.

203
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,950
This will be the end for all.

204
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,560
All shall be darkened by me.

205
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,930
White shall vanish,

206
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,960
and everything shall be crushed in black!

207
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,440
You're the one who's going
to get crushed, Germfiend.

208
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,010
This is the end, Tapir.

209
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,800
We shall see if white or black survives!

210
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,990
Time to settle this once and for all!

211
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,690
Cease your prattle, worms!

212
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,810
Return to the sea of pixels!

213
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,740
Let's go!

214
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,900
Release all of your power!

215
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,210
Put everything

216
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,430
into this single blow!

217
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,030
Go!

218
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,990
What?! They stopped my wave?!

219
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,520
Curse you!

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,080
Are you contesting me?!

221
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,540
Crafty bastards!

222
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,600
I'll crush you and your impertinent wave!

223
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,720
My body is turning into pixels...

224
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,610
I cannot be stopped!

225
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,170
Nobody can stop me!

226
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,000
We won't last long against this.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,860
At this rate, we'll both
be kicking the bucket.

228
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,360
Go.

229
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,110
What?

230
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,050
I'll hold him back.

231
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,620
While I distract him, you defeat him!

232
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,390
He should be defenseless right now.

233
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,020
This is our only chance to defeat him!

234
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,380
How can you possibly hold him off yourself when
the two of us can barely cope, moron?

235
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,580
I have a plan.

236
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,440
And I can't move with my legs like this.

237
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,190
You're the only one who
can reach him now.

238
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,330
Hurry it up!

239
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,100
While you can still move!

240
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,020
Bastard...

241
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,610
You better not have forgotten our promise.

242
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,530
Do not worry.

243
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,510
He cannot hurt me.

244
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,900
Who do you think I am?!

245
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,670
Gintoki Sakata.

246
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,640
A man based off you.

247
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,300
Brother...

248
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,640
Friend...

249
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,350
I earned many titles for a mere copy...

250
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,360
But no matter what I'm called,

251
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,870
I cannot lose sight of my role...my duty...

252
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,650
Lady Tama, forgive me.

253
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,810
My duty is not to live,

254
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,430
it is to protect you.

255
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,900
I cannot live for the sake of another,

256
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,690
but grant me the right to die for a friend...

257
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,010
To die for my brother!

258
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,270
Impossible...

259
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,330
His power is surging..

260
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,830
How does he have so much power left?!

261
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,370
I have plenty of power left...

262
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,860
My very life...

263
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:37,850
C-Could you be releasing
all of your life energy?

264
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,800
Impossible!

265
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,300
If you do that, you'll...

266
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,720
You'll...!

267
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,030
You think you damn viruses

268
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,430
can defeat the Leukocyte King?

269
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,430
Defeat...

270
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,210
Gintoki Sakata?! Never!

271
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,960
Attention to everybody inside this body.

272
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,450
The virus, which infected this
body, has been destroyed.

273
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,160
This body will now engage
in reparations.

274
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,580
All surviving security members

275
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,030
should take a vacation from their
regular duties to make babies.

276
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,970
The surviving viruses should change
into white bodysuits at once.

277
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,730
You are already under our control.

278
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,610
Please assist with making babies.

279
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,620
Sorry I couldn't keep my promise...

280
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,320
I'm irresponsible by default.

281
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,160
I got that from you.

282
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,100
Looks like it.

283
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,580
I broke my promise to Tama.

284
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,830
It's extremely regrettable.

285
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,240
I never expected to become
a piece of junk.

286
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,590
I was an excellent security measure
before you all came.

287
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,270
A hero guarding the princess.

288
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,450
I would have been happy to throw
my life away to protect Lady Tama.

289
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,860
And yet I gave my life to save this stupid
party instead of the princess...

290
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,120
Before, I wouldn't have thought
twice about dying...

291
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,350
But now...

292
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,780
I want to live a little longer...

293
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:49,380
I wouldn't have minded a little more adventuring
with Lady Tama and the lot of you...

294
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,610
Leukocyte King-san...

295
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,770
For such words to come out of
an easily replaced substitute...

296
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,940
It's all your fault...

297
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,120
It appears that I've completely
broken down.

298
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,420
You haven't broken down.

299
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,000
You're no substitute.

300
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,650
You're a much better guy than I am.

301
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,890
You protected what you needed to.

302
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,370
I don't just mean Tama.

303
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,660
You also protected our lives.

304
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,490
So don't die.

305
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,390
Don't die for your friends.

306
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,160
You have to live for your friends, for us...

307
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,750
Lady Tama will be fine with
you people around.

308
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,810
Besides, I can no longer...

309
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,620
Gintoki-sama, everybody...

310
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,890
Thank you for protecting the
Leukocyte King all this time.

311
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,420
It's Tama-san! Tama-san's voice!

312
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,530
It's Tama. Are you okay now?

313
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,370
Where are you? Where are you at?

314
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,750
Here. Over here.

315
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,870
Here. I'm right here.

316
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,100
Tiny!

317
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,420
L-Lady Tama...

318
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,650
What are you doing, Tama?
Why are you so tiny?

319
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,890
My system has not completely recovered,

320
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,280
but I was able to send a pixel copy over.

321
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,400
Leukocyte King, thank you for protecting
me for such a long time.

322
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,750
Now it is my turn to save you.

323
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,810
Tama-san, can you...

324
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:20,200
I shall enter the Leukocyte King's
body and repair him.

325
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,850
Leukocyte King, I will not let you die.

326
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,300
L-Lady Tama...

327
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,750
We're coming along then.

328
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,980
[Note: Moshasu is a spell from Dragon Quest
to transform one of the characters in the party.]

329
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,080
We owe the Moshasu Gin-chan.

330
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,980
Uh, but how are we supposed
to go inside him?

331
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,550
We're too big to enter...

332
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,760
I knew you'd say that.

333
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,690
That's why I brought the magic mallet Z.

334
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,950
Okay! Line up if you want to be shrunk!

335
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,150
I'll smash you all good!

336
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,040
Th-They're...

337
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,730
There you have it.

338
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,940
Your life is no longer
yours to throw away.

339
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,000
You're more than someone
who protects Tama.

340
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,290
All the protecting you've done has led to
people who will protect you in return.

341
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,300
All squirmy-like...

342
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,720
Just like a white blood cell.

343
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,940
I just had to be the copy
of such a difficult man.

344
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:29,220
Even now, I can't offer any words
of gratitude or tears...

345
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,450
What would you do in this situation?

346
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,270
Smile.

347
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,540
[The End?]

348
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,580
Enemy spotted.

349
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,970
An unidentified new virus.

350
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,110
An extremely large army is
advancing on our position!

351
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,510
Unbelievable...

352
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,560
And we haven't recovered from
the Tapir invasion yet...

353
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,450
Will we be able to fight them off
with our meager numbers?

354
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,030
What is there to fear?

355
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:28,760
Every white flag may vanish from this land,
but our army will not fight on its own.

356
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,260
Our army may be destroyed,
but we will not be alone.

357
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,100
Though we may be in different places,

358
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,620
there are others who carry
the same will and fight.

359
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,190
Though they may fly
a different color flag,

360
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,290
we have comrades who possess
the same proud, white spirit!

361
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,960
Even an army one million strong

362
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,990
cannot darken this white!

363
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,990
Tally ho!

364
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:16,470
[Preview]

365
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,590
It could happen to anyone...

366
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,610
Even to an animated character...

367
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:16,820
As long as genes, unhealthy behavior, stress,
and other various factors are involved,

368
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,980
["You Don't Know What You've Got Till It's Gone"]

369
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,500
all people have a chance of going bald.

370
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,610

371
