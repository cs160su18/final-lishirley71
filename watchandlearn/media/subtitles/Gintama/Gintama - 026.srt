00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,570
Keep your room well-lit.

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,130
And don't sit too close to the television.

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,070
[Today they are working in a convenience store. The most popular item in the store is the "Tasty Stick".]

5
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:42,080
[Gin-san, who has a sweet-tooth, always picks chocolate flavor. Don't forget "Bargain Dash Ice Cream" too!]

6
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,280
Welcome!

7
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,110
Never mind the welcome.

8
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,700
If you're working, how come you're eating Nmaibo?

9
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,700
Note: "Nmaibo" literally means tasty stick.

10
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,060
Because it's nmai.

11
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,540
Are you trying to make a fool outta me?

12
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,600
Hey! You're spilling crumbs into my bag!

13
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,280
Hey! Where's the store manager?! Manger?!

14
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,190
I'm the manager, Sakata. Sir, got a problem?

15
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,420
You two are the problem!

16
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,670
Hey, he seems awfully upset. What'd you do?

17
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,850
I don't know. He's been in a bad mood since he walked in, manager!

18
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,450
Hey! I'm telling you to stop munching on that! Hey!

19
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,400
Sorry, sir.

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,450
We're temporary help, so we're not too familiar with sophisticated marketing issues.

21
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,300
But we're doing our best, so give us a break.

22
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,610
I don't care if you do your best. I'm just telling to take that stick out of your mouth!

23
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,430
Hey! What're you microwaving over there?!

24
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,940
I don't know. But I'm working really hard at it, yup!

25
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,410
Yup?! Hey, my JUMP's in there!

26
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,710
Huh?! It exploded! What exploded?!

27
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,630
What're you doing, you?! My JUMP is covered with salad dressing!

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
I don't know about that.

29
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,700
But I think it's a good thing to have a cozy convenience store like this in such a cold-hearted era.

30
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,850
It's not! Gimme back my money!

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,510
That's why I said it was impossible for us.

32
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,020
Say, I'm looking after a convenience store as a favor to my friend.

33
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,790
But I have some business I gotta take care of and can't watch over the store.

34
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,310
Sorry, it's only for one day. Thanks so much.

35
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,560
See you!

36
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,870
At this rate, by the time Hasegawa-san returns, the shop will be out of business.

37
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,030
What're you doing?

38
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,510
Open your shirts. You stole something, didn't you?

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,780
What?! I didn't...!

40
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,840
Sh-Shin-chan?

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Takachin?

42
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,770
["Don't Be Shy - Just Raise Your Hand and Say It"]

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,220
Hachibei Takaya, age sixteen.  The same as you, Shinpachi.

44
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,790
Aren't you embarrassed? Stealing at your age!

45
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,200
You'll make your mama cry.

46
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,620
Besides, what were you planning to do with so much hair styling gel?

47
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,190
Quit worrying about your hair and be more confident about yourself!

48
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,270
Like I was gonna use all of this myself!

49
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,680
Then what? A condiment?

50
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,830
Were you planning to pour it over your rice so you could eat silky, luxuriant food?

51
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,430
Takachin, why'd you do such a thing?

52
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,840
Takachin, you didn't used to be like this.

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,830
Shut up! How many years do you think have passed?

54
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,830
I'm not the Takachin you used to know.

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,510
So just take me wherever...to the police station or the magistrate.

56
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,310
And if they wanna crucify me, fine!

57
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,700
Don't expect me to be grateful.

58
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,620
I'll just come back again.

59
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,260
And I'll stop you again.

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,120
Sheesh, still the same goody-two-shoes, eh? Shin-chan.

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
Leave Takachin alone!

62
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,580
When we were at Temple school together, you and your sister always came to my rescue.

63
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,510
Shin-chan!

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,250
We'll make you cry too!

65
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,590
Go ahead and cry!

66
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,140
I will not! I'm a samurai's son!

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,460
What's the big idea, you bullies!

68
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,050
Well, it was mostly your sister creating a scene.

69
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,520
Brings back memories.

70
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,020
I thought you'd be my friend, no matter what happened.

71
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,730
Until that day that you betrayed me.

72
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,580
Takachin, that was...

73
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,570
I don't wanna hear your excuses!

74
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,450
Do you know how much I suffered because of your half-assed attempt at kindness?!

75
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,530
Ever since that day, I...

76
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,270
Well, forget it.

77
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,050
Thanks to you, I got a little stronger.

78
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,380
I'm in a gang now.

79
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,860
Heard of them? The Bulldogs?

80
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,170
I don't need to rely on your strength anymore. I'm strong now!

81
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:08,130
[Note: Chinko means penis.]

82
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,930
Takachinko? Who's that?

83
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,130
Not Takachinko. Takachin.

84
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,270
You really don't remember?

85
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,860
I've forgotten about the past.

86
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,710
I've decided to be more forward-thinking.

87
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,370
But never mind that. I brought you all a treat.

88
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,670
Gin-san, Kagura-san, please help yourselves.

89
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,320
Yay! Big sis!

90
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,930
I tried making something new.

91
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,440
Here you go. Rolled omelets.

92
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,480
I'll go and get some drinks!.

93
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,250
Never mind. I'll go, you sit!

94
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,890
This is a convenience store. You can find all the drinks you need right here.

95
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,170
You mustn't embarrass a girl like that.

96
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,270
Shin-chan, come here and eat. It's very good.

97
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,410
Shin-chan...?

98
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,550
Sister...

99
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,840
Without a doubt, the Bulldogs are the rowdiest gang around.

100
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,100
They fight and steal without a care.

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,690
[Note: Chinpo also means penis.]

102
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,690
Shin-chan, why are you so concerned about Takachinpo.

103
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,170
It's Takachin, Sister.

104
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,150
It's my fault that Takachin turned that way. I turned my back on him.

105
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,530
When he was at his lowest point...

106
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Sh-Shin-chan, what'll I do? I pooped my pants.

107
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,100
What'll I do, Shin-chan?

108
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,970
Shin-chan, I'll bet you're really awake.

109
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,480
Shin-chan, Shin-chan!

110
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,590
The springtime of youth is like a sandcastle. The smallest thing can make it crumble.

111
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,500
Right after that, I stopped going to the Temple school due to family debts.

112
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,770
But it's not hard to imagine Takachin's life after that.

113
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,230
What should I have done back then?

114
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,740
How could I have answered Takachin's call?

115
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,900
No, no. That was a hopeless case.

116
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,170
Yes, totally hopeless.

117
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,680
No, it wasn't.

118
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,160
When your friend is crying, cry with him.

119
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,850
When your friend is worried, you should worry with him.

120
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,190
When your friend has an awkward bowel movement...

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,940
then you must have a bowel movement too, Shin-chan.

122
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,650
If you are a friend, you should be able to share the other's pain, no matter what.

123
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,180
And Shin-chan, if your friend goes down the wrong path...

124
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,560
Then, you must stop your friend, even if it ruins your friendship.

125
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,150
That is true samurai friendship.

126
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,380
Excuse me, manager. I have some business to take care of. Please excuse me.

127
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,000
Hey, hey, are you sure about this?

128
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,400
You never know what the youth will do these days.

129
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,780
Don't come crying to me if something happens.

130
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,820
[Bulldog]

131
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,190
You useless idiot! Who said to get regular-hold mousse?!

132
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,700
I told you, didn't I?

133
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,490
I need extra control styling mousse to hold my hair in place!

134
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,170
I-I'm sorry. I ran into a little trouble.

135
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,910
You begged me to let you to join the gang, so I made an exception!

136
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,470
But if you can't even do a simple errand, what's the use?

137
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,900
I think I need to beat some of that fighting spirit into you, right? Some spirit.

138
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,580
Wh-What's this?!

139
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,770
Hey, what're you doing?!

140
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,230
Hachibei, we'll give you some fighting spirit!

141
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,230
Wh-Wha--?!

142
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,250
Who the hell are you?!

143
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,220
Who am I? You must be some amateur if you don't know who I am.

144
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,190
I am the President of the Otsu-chan Fan Club, Shinpachi Shimura!

145
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,290
Sh-Shin-chan...

146
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,930
What're you doing here?! This is no place for you!

147
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,250
Go home!

148
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,240
Excuse me!

149
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,860
Who's your leader?

150
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,970
Huh? As if our Chairman would see a guy like you!

151
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,850
So, kid? Whaddya want?

152
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,090
I'm here to take Hachibei Takaya back.

153
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,330
From this moment on, he is resigning from the Bulldogs and joining the Otsu-chan Fan Club!

154
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,110
I came to get your permission.

155
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,510
Wh-What're you saying?! Otsu-chan Fan Club? What the hell is that? I...

156
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,230
Takachin. I'm just like you.

157
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,550
Since that crap incident, I've been sick of my weakness, and I've wanted to become stronger.

158
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,250
But Takachin, there's no shortcut to becoming strong.

159
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,530
Even if you try to look strong, appearances eventually wear off.

160
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,830
Joining a gang and hiding behind the ferocity of some other guy's strength...

161
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,860
Is that the kind of strength you want?

162
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,470
Do you really want to be like these uncool guys?

163
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,810
Kid! Sorry, but this gang ain't no social club.

164
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,000
This ain't the kind of organization where you can just say "I quit." And we just say "Oh, okay then."

165
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,670
In that case, I'll take him by force.

166
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,750
Hey, don't underestimate us, brat!

167
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,100
And what makes you think you can do anything alone!

168
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,260
He's not alone!

169
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,830
Hey Chief, part-time work is a pain in the ass! I couldn't stand it.

170
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,420
If it's a fight you want, then we'll join in!

171
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,970
The Otsu-chan Fan Club Special Attack Squad "Maltese" has arrived!

172
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,360
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

173
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,100
[Maltese(?) Please verify.]

174
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,130
Hey... My hairline looks unnatural today.

175
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,730
Geez, what if it falls off while I'm galloping along?

176
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,920
My carefully built reputation will be in ruins, that's for sure.

177
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:37,370
Oh well, I overdid it when I was younger... All the hair dyes and permaments.

178
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,680
I guess I'll just have to glue it on today.

179
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,930
Chairma-a-a-an!

180
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,660
Y-You idiot!! At least knock first, okay?

181
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,710
S-Sorry!

182
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,750
Huh? Where should I have knocked?

183
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,810
Knock in your heart! What do you want?

184
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,600
We've got trouble!! A bunch of guys came to fight and they're crazy strong!

185
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,340
Slaaaash!

186
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,930
What're you jerks doing?!

187
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,620
Chairman!

188
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,430
I keep telling you, don't settle everything with violence!

189
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,620
What's going on? What happened?

190
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,930
Chairman... I think something happened to your head.

191
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,810
Just the four of you taking on the Bulldogs? Edo's strongest and fastest gang?

192
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,370
Who are you guys?

193
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,470
Huh? We're the...you know. Special Force...um...what was it?

194
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,930
Huh? Special Force Pomeranian... Wasn't that it?

195
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,830
Yeah, something like that. Let's use that.

196
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,030
It's Maltese. At least remember our gang name.

197
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,180
Oh yeah! We're the Malcheese!

198
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,930
A circle with a triangular piece of cheese.

199
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,940
Don't mess with us!

200
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,950
Huh? "Don't mess with Maltese"? I don't get it...

201
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,640
Never heard of you. What do you want anyway?!

202
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,240
We're taking Takachin with us! I won't let you force my friend to shoplift!

203
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,990
Takachin? Do we have a member named that?

204
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,390
Yes. They mean Takaya, the one who just joined up recently.

205
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,020
And? Where is he?

206
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,560
Over there.

207
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,390
Hey! What're you doing?!

208
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,150
Huh? This is Takachinko? My mistake, dude... Dammit!

209
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,860
Don't mess with me!

210
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,060
How could you make a mistake?!

211
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,610
Well, everyone's hair looks like a baguette. I couldn't tell the difference.

212
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,590
Hey!

213
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,680
Four-eyes, are you Takaya's friend? I get it.

214
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,560
You came here to rehabilitate your buddy, eh?

215
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,800
I like that.

216
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,480
You want that small fry in your gang. Okay, take him.

217
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,230
But Chairman!

218
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,320
But, I want you to do something, first.

219
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,470
We have a ceremony one has to undergo before leaving the gang.

220
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,020
In his current condition, Takaya can't do it.

221
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,590
You guys are gonna do it for him.

222
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,930
The rules are simple.

223
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,940
You ride motorbikes to the edge of town... to the freeway that's under construction.

224
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,830
If you get there first, I'll let you take Takaya.

225
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,340
Anything goes. Using weapons, interfering with the opposing team, whatever.

226
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,290
If I was you, I'd have one of ya ride and the other one attack and obstruct.

227
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,590
All of you have to race. And we'll have four from our team.

228
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:36,470
Excuse me. We only have one scooter. Can you lend us one, creep?

229
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,560
Are you really a bike gang?!

230
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,730
Damn right, we are! We're eco-friendly rabble-rousers!

231
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,030
I guess we have no choice.

232
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,340
Huh? Sis, you can drive this thing?

233
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,520
A samurai does not concern himself with petty details, dude.

234
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,250
Gin-chan, I need to go to the little girl's room.

235
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,020
Then go take a leak over there someplace, dude.

236
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,410
What a thing to tell a lady!

237
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,860
Heh-heh, this is gonna be interesting.

238
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,740
Okay, get ready!

239
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,840
Ready...get...set... Go Bull...

240
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,900
...dogs!

241
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,290
The fools, here they come!

242
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,830
They have no idea this is a bloody ceremony to punish traitors!

243
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,850
You're all gonna die here!

244
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,560
Do it!

245
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,830
Flatten 'em!

246
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,600
Heizo!

247
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,990
Who's gonna die, Heizo-chan?

248
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,900
Gin-chan, I can't hold it anymore.

249
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,980
Go ahead and pee.

250
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,600
That's the power of our ultra moisturizer! Just lie there and grovel!

251
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,310
Why you--!

252
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,460
Wh-What?!

253
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,950
She used her teammate as a springboard!

254
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,080
Sis, what're you doing?! You probably just killed Gin-san! Hey!

255
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,870
I won't allow anybody to pass me!

256
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,560
I am the wind! Born free like the wind! Yahoo!

257
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,970
Huh?! Sis! Did you pass into another dimension or something?

258
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,770
It feels so good!

259
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,360
If we speed up by three kilometers, I think we could travel through time!

260
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,990
Sis! Time travel on your own time, okay?

261
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,290
First, the handle bars! Grab the handle bars!

262
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,200
You're not going to pass us!

263
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,560
I'll show you how frightening we Bulldogs are!

264
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,370
What're you doing?! I have three kilometers more to go! Don't interfere!

265
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,570
Hey, the handle bars! The handle bars!

266
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,110
Hey, no! Don't!

267
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,500
He's bald!

268
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,980
Sister, snap out of it! It wasn't real!

269
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,220
It's just a wig!

270
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,310
Whoa! What happened! All my hair got pulled out, and now it looks like I'm bald!

271
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,860
Why are you over explaining it like that?

272
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,880
Hey Matsutaro, is there anything you want?

273
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Chairman, don't worry. Everyone's known about your hair condition for a long time.

274
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,350
Oh no! Seriously?

275
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,100
Shinpachi!

276
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,000
Just hang in there a little longer! Hang on!

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,410
What the hell is this brat?!

278
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,910
What's the big deal with rabble rousing biker gangs?!

279
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,370
I've been raising hell all my life!

280
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,720
Show 'em we're in a totally different class, Gin-chan!

281
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,360
Who is that?!

282
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,660
It's Gin-chan!

283
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,900
That's why I told him to switch the sake with strawberry milk!

284
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,450
Don't blame the sake! Your head's to blame!

285
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,740
You guys are better as comedians than a biker gang!

286
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,870
Oh yeah?

287
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,900
Looks like you're the comedian! What with your fly away wig and all!

288
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,290
Why you--!

289
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,240
Gin-san!

290
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,160
Was that girl just a decoy? You pulled my attention offa you...

291
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,770
I could send you straight to hell right now with my Special Samurai German Suplex.

292
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,640
But that would dampen Shinpachi's enthusiasm.

293
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,420
So from this point on, you'll race our captain fair and square!

294
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,820
Shinpachi! Go on and win this one for us.

295
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,510
Right!

296
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,820
Cripes!

297
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,790
What a pain in the ass!

298
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,340
What's the point of rescuing a useless idiot like you?

299
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,100
Poor guy, he could be dead by now.

300
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,210
Yup, there's never been anyone who lived through this ceremony.

301
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,040
Maybe they ran away.

302
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,010
That's possible. Maybe they groveled before the Chairman and begged for forgiveness.

303
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,130
They're late.

304
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,720
Maybe they really are dead.

305
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,830
Say something!

306
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,420
They're your friends, after all.

307
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,980
No doubt they're all dead.

308
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,530
Right. Flies attract flies. A scumbag is bound to have scumbag friends!

309
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,270
Hey, look.

310
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,100
What?

311
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,610
No way!

312
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,420
Don't tell me he made it through all the traps!

313
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,190
What about the bike?! He ran the whole way?!

314
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,550
Never mind the bike! The Chairman doesn't have his wig!

315
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,200
Takachin... I'm just like you, Takachin.

316
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,770
I hated my own weakness... and I always wanted to be strong...

317
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,640
That's why...

318
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,500
You fool...

319
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,010
Damn, thanks for nothing.

320
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,200
Do you know how hard it was for me to join that gang?

321
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,610
So you tried to make amends. Well, it's too late.

322
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,810
All right, I get it.

323
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,710
Listen, I'm not forgiving you, ever!

324
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,550
So don't pull anything like that again.

325
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,120
Takachin...

326
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,090
Back there... the chairman said he was impressed with your spirit.

327
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,690
He was gonna make you join the gang! Turning him down was a hassle.

328
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,090
I had to explain that I couldn't let my friend get mixed up in something like that.

329
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,500
Okay, okay. I hear you.

330
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,320
I've got to stop asking those jerks for help.

331
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:22,030
[Preview]

332
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,910
What's this?

333
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,630
Otsu-chan! Popular idol singer turned fighter!

334
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,380
When a person says something like that, it's a warning sign.

335
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,520
My favorite ramen shop once said, "Why don't we try serving curry?"

336
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,700
After that, the shop had to close.

337
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,500
The next episode: "Some Things Can't Be Cut with a Sword."

[Antonio Kagura breaks in to the "Amazons Tournament"!]

339
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:35,050
[Gintoki and Shinpachi try to leave acting like they don't know anything. But they meet someone unexpected.]

340
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,240
Just bring it from anywhere, jock itch!

341
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,640
Okay, next show is by those two guys, King Kong. Thank you.
