Want to take a break with me?

00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,590
Sure.

13
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,440
Hey, why is she taking
a break with you?!

14

That's right! No cheating!

me, don't you, Kuriko-chan?

19

No, with me, right?

Shut up!! I took a break

You're just trying to stop your daughter's

I can't do this. I'm leaving!!

Hey, wait. When did I ask you to do that?

38

I just want to kill those men.

39

There's no way I'm doing that either!!

40

up with a boyfriend, like before...

But this time, they're not even dating.

44

They look like they were
just hitting on her.

Once they're hitting on her, it's too late!!

kill them before they try anything!!

about this stupid parent.

the one on the left.

53

Sogo, you take the one on the right.
I'll take out the one in the middle!

54

Hey!! I told you this is just like last time!!

Anyway, don't do anything rash!!

56

In short, you want them
to give up on her, right?

57

There are a lot of easier ways to do that.

Oh? You've got quite a bit of confidence.

60

If you go as far as to say that, Toshi,
I guess I'll leave this to you.

us at the amusement park.

I'll go.

64

I'll shove a ton of enemas up their asses
and make them crap their pants.

65

Toshi, Kuriko-chan's the type of girl who isn't disgusted
even if her boyfriend craps his pants.

66
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,930
When I crap my pants, you guys
are so disgusted with me.

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,650
How are you going to attack them?

68
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,850
Now, hold on, Kondo, Sogo.
Toshi is pretty confident.

69
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,690
This is convenient.

70
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,120

did to us at the amusement park.

What is he doing?

99
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,950
He moved!!

go somewhere else?

We don't have any money.

Oh well, in that case...

150
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,320
Wait, wait! Calm down and listen to me.

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,800
That was not a confession of my love.

152
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,780
Your father asked me to do that.

153
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,690
In other words, I was just acting.

154
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,400
There were those three shabby guys
at the convenience store, right?

155
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,860
I did it to scare them away.

156
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm sorry I said that even though
I'm not interested in you.

157
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,760
But it looks like they're gone
now. I'm going to stop acting.

Mayo-sama...

159
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,830
Mayo 13-sama...

160
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,710
That's the story. Got that?

161
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,010
I've been in love with you from
the moment I saw you.

162
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,150
And I wished that I could see you again.

163
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,850
And my wish was granted and
we had such a fateful reunion.

164
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,670
Your embrace was so strong and
your words were so sweet.

165
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,540
I felt as if I was ascending to heaven!

166
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,640
Say, are you listening to me?

167
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,150
I'd be in an awkward position
if your father saw us here.

168
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,420
He'd shoot me.

169
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,860
I know this is a bit cold, but I don't have
any intention of going out with you.

170
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,350
You're wonderful. You're wonderful
and charming, but...

171
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,420
Charming, you say?

172
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,620
Hey! Don't just listen to the
parts you want to hear.

173
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,200
"Charming" is that thing that men say...

174
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,950
...when they're politely turning
someone down.

175
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,420
I've got to return to the store.

176
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,430
Huh?!

177
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,460
I think we can have a date
this upcoming weekend.

178
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,980
Until then, take care.

179
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,690
H-Hey!!

180
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,860
Why are we suddenly on a
date?! I refused, didn't I?!

181
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,560
I told you I wasn't going to go
out with you, right? Right?!

182
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,510
She's not listening.

183
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,160
Sir, it looks like something
is bothering you.

184
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,430
We heard everything.

185
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,530
We're professional relationship busters.

186
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,720
We break up people's relationships for
money and white rice. We'll help you.

187
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,390
Y-You saw all of it?!

188
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,930
Tsk. I don't really want your help.

189
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,040
Oh? Does this mean you want
to continue your relationship?

190
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,750
You'll have a wonderful newlywed life.

191
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,890
You'll have a poodle and
wear the same clothes.

192
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,610
You'll hold hands as you go shopping
at the supermarket.

193
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,980
You'll come home every day at 6:00.

194
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,320
You'll have dinner as you listen to
her complain about the neighbors.

195
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,890
When you're about to take off
your undershirt to take a bath,

196
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,420
you'll realize that your gut
has been getting big.

197
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,470
Your wife will just talk to
the television and say...

198
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,460
Honey, can't you make a bit more money?

199
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,530
That's easy to say... But the company's
having a rough time...

We predict a bland and terrible future.

201
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,170
Hey, can you really end this charade
without hurting that girl's feelings?

202
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,030
Believe in me.

203
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,680
Listen up. A man's worth...

204
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,270
is decided when he can get a woman
to dump him instead of dumping her.

205
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,680
You need to make sure she no longer has
any interest in you and make her hate you.

206
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,890
A girl's heart is like cotton candy.
Any little thing can make it shrivel.

207
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,490
You should just show her the unpleasant
and disgusting side of men.

208
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,930
In short, it's the "Hijikata-san,
you're disgusting!!" Plan.

"Hijiketsu" for short.

211
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,660
The problem is what exactly
we should do, isn't it?

212
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,500
Domestic violence, gambling,
drunken frenzies...

213
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,750
There are many things that women don't
like about men, but the one that gets...

214
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,570
the quickest result is this.

215
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,210
Actually, I only like to watch
movies like this...

I can finally see all those parts
they wouldn't show on TV.

218
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,090
I've been waiting for this moment.

219
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,080
Wow, this is painful.

220
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,560
Most people would be disgusted.

221
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,550
I'm having him act like he's
a hopeless anime otaku.

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
He's had experience as a hopeless
otaku when he was

223

possessed by his demonic sword
and turned into Toshi.

Otaku are the best way
to disgust women.

225

We don't have to watch
it if you don't want to...

226
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,480
I'll watch it when I'm by myself, though...

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,930
I don't want to.

It's a complete failure, Gin-chan.

Oh, it's going to start soon. Let's hurry.

Are you dissatisfied?

Would it have been better if
there were fewer bubbles?

240
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,780
Did it need more tentacles?

That bitch is formidable.

"That"?

What is "that"?

246
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,430
Two servings of the usual.

247
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,370
Got it.

248
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,450
Is this the restaurant you usually go to?

249
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,020
It has a very traditional

The Hijikata Special, otherwise
known as Dog Food.

252

Is there anyone who wouldn't be
disgusted by the sight of that?

253
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,020
Disgusted?

254
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,180
I get a sour taste in my mouth
just looking at that.

255

00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,260
Yes. It's very delicious.

261

I've found a kindred spirit here of all places.

262

Why do you ask that?

No... It's nothing.

to something so delicious.

it off pretty well.

00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,010
to vent your pent-up anger?!

311
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,200
You bastard!

312
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,680
Mayo-sama, you risked your
life to protect me, didn't you?

313
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,940
Huh? Well, umm, uhh… It was a
conditioned reflex or something.

314
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,700
You're getting bashful. That's so cute.

315
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,380
How could I say something
so embarrassing?

316

Don't hate me…

317
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,090

318
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
I don't care what happens anymore.

319

I'm running away.

Running away, Hijikata-san?

And leave that girl permanently scarred?

It doesn't matter how many men you kill.

323

You must never betray
a girl's pure feelings.

Whoa! He's saying obnoxious
things again!

Kagura-chan, do you have
any suggestions?

326
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,530
If he runs away, she'll just forget
him after three days.

327
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,130
She's got a harsh and really
plausible opinion.

328
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,690
Aww, crap! Why did this
have to happen to me?

329
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,410
Running away is fine,

330
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,850
but are you prepared to never
appear in front of her again?

331
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,220
Of course.

332

Are you prepared to do
anything to run away?

333
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,010
It depends on the situation.
I'll do whatever I can!

It's useless. There's no way
this is going to work.

I sensed that you were
not a normal person.

end of my sentences and it worked!!

I'll die if I stay on Earth too long, mayo.

Are you going?

355

I want to go with you.

361

This is headed in the wrong
direction, isn't it?

362

No, hold on, Toshiro!! You can do this.

in a mayonnaise atmosphere, mayo.

survive there, mayo.
