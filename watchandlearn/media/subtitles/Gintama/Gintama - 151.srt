[New TV Show]

[Note: Spoof of Episode 3]

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,390
The land of the host.

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,140
There was a time, long ago, when our town was called by that name.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,600
Those dream-filled Shinjuku skies, upon which Japanese hosts once gazed upon their dreams,

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,890
are now filled with words by hosts from foreign countries.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,850
However, there were two men.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,220
The enigmatic vagrant, Gintoki Sakata

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,470
and the former number one host, Shinpachi Buttchin.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,180
The two of them still run in this corrupt night town.

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,670
[Note: "Kintama" - homonym for "testicles." Also, "Kin" means "gold" as opposed to "Gin" (silver).]

[Episode 1]

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,560
And drink! And drink!

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,190
Drink until you puke!

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,720
Drink until you puke!

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,070
[Note: Spoof of drinking game./ Original text is Shigeo Nomo, combination of two baseball players Hideo Nomo and Shigeo Nagashima. Nomo sounds like "to drink" in Japanese.]

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,170
Chug one! Chug two! Chug-a-choo-choo!

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,070
And chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,530
You idiot!

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,010
I'm so sorry, Erica-sama.

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,720
Nowadays, even a chimpanzee could do this!

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,500
Why can't you do this?

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,070
I-I'm sorry.

25
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,100
Being the number one host is the only thing I've ever done...

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,480
That number one stuff and your customers are all gone!

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,140
How long are you going to act as if you're popular? Huh?

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,100
Come on now.

29
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,770
Just leave it at that.

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,520
Don't bother with the drinks. Just get me a light.

31
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,140
Oh... All right. Right away.

32
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,890
What are you doing, Buttchin?!

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,140
I can't help but want to mess with him.

34
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,550
My position and customers have been taken away.

35
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,220
I have abandoned my pride and everything else.

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,300
What are you doing, Shinpachi?!

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,080
I'm so sorry, Miss.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,250
You apologize too, you worthless piece of trash!

39
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,100
Hey.

40
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,110
He was too fierce to be called a host.

41
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,630
But too focused to be called a customer.

42
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,100
Where's your restroom?

43
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,370
He was just passing through!

44
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,960
[To Be Continued]

45
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,320
One, two, three! Go!

46
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,970
Here!

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,350
Four mitarashi, right?

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,350
[Note: Mitarashi are sweet soy sauce flavored dango.]

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,670
240 yen exactly.

50
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,560
Please come again!

51
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,020
Do you know why Chonmage turned into something that involved shaving?

52
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,560
[Note: Chonmage is the traditional Japanese topknot hairstyle worn from the Edo to Meiji period.]

53
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,080
People started growing pimples on the top of their head or something?

54
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,180
No, no. It was so it wouldn't get too stuffy when they put their helmets on.

55
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,720
In other words, it's a symbol of how the samurai are always prepared for battle.

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,450
Like the spirit of a samurai.

57
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,060
Spirit, huh...

58
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,400
But these days, they've given up the Mage hairstyle and the spirit.

59
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,400
[Note: Mage is short for Chonmage]

60
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,560
Now they want their hair all curly or dyed.

61
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,850
Wouldn't the Land of Samurai be shocked to know?

62
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,640
It's a disgrace.

63
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,610
Isn't that right?

64
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,560
So what'll it be today?

65
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,280
A straight perm.

66
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,450
You never give up, Pops.

67
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,790
You can tell that story for the rest of your life and I still won't ask for a Mage.

68
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,350
A straight perm.

69
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,420
You never give up, big guy.

70
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,670
That won't be enough to fix your hair.

71
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,250
Your twisted personality is twisting your hair.

72
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,440
Just go with a Mage.

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,100
We have to fix you from the inside.

74
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,580
Cut it out already.

75
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,550
A Mage is the spirit of a samurai?

76
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,170
That's just an excuse those balding oldies came up with.

77
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,860
"This isn't a receding hairline.

78
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,100
It's so I can wear the helmet."

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,780
Put a wig on before you wear the helmet, moron.

80
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,460
You have no idea.

81
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,320
You don't shave your head so you can put the helmet on.

82
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,720
You become bald because you're wearing a helmet.

83
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,820

[Note: Rubens Barrichello, Formula 1 driver.]

87
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,310
Even *****neuve, famous for being handsome, had a receding hairline after four years in the F1.

88
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,310
[Note: Jacques Villeneuve. Also Formula 1 driver]

89
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,950
Going airtight can lead to scary results.

90
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,540
F1 drivers don't tie their hair back.

91
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,710
See?

92
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,940
Not only is Mage part of the identity,

93
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,300
the whole idea is a kind of practice, where everyone shaves their head so bald people don't feel bad.

94
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,800
We can all go bald together.

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
What's that?

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,520
Some kind of human instrumentality project?

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,520
[Note: From Neon Genesis Evangelion]

98
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,600
You done yet, Gin-chan?

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,760
Huh?

100
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,990
Hey, what is this?

101
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,060
That's not cleaned up at all.

102
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,530
He'll have to come get it cut again in no time.

103
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,390
Cut it shorter.

104
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,960
Master, please give him a buzz cut.

105
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,850
Mom?!

106
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,060
An afro perm works, too.

107
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,560
One that takes a really long time.

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,540
Why are you trying to read all of Golgo 17?

109
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,540
[Note: Spoof of Golgo 13]

110
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,500
Get lost, moron.

111
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,850
This isn't a manga cafe!

112
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,830
What?

113
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm in the middle of the episode "Shen Long".

114
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,460
[Note: Dragon god from DRAGON BALL.]

115
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,060
Golgo has accepted an offer to fight Shen Long for control of the school!

116
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,870
Ah, it's fine.

117
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,370
Read as long as you want.

118
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,290
For real?

119
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,700
Golgo 17 is a wonderful manga.

120
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,830
You'll become smarter.

121
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,230
You'll become the prime minister.

122
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,850
[Note: The current Prime Minister of Japan, Taro Aso, is known for being big manga fan.]

123
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,850
But your mouth will become crooked.

124
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,990
Can I read Abu-san, too?

125
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,180
Go ahead.

126
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,600
Ah, Kagura-chan, you've got some beefy taste in manga.

127
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,690
Abu-san's another good manga.

128
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,610
Who would have thought that they could go thirty years just by catching abu.

129
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:05,600
[Note: Abu is horsefly in Japanese. "Abu-san" manga is really about a baseball player. This manga has been serialized in Big Comic Original since 1973.]

130
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,110
He's already passed his sixtieth birthday.

131
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,600
I can't even imagine what that manga's about.

132
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,350
Well, I don't get any customers anyway.

133
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,290
Feel free to come read whenever you like.

134
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,350
Business is bad, Pops?

135
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,610
A new beauty parlor...

136
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,340
I guess they call them hair salons now?

137
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,810
Or is it hair cut studios?

138
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,570
...was built across the street.

139
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,120
Ever since, my customers stopped coming.

140
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,350
I don't know if they've got some charismatic hairdresser or a guy with scissor hands,

141
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,080
but their business is through the roof.

142
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,970
They charge outrageous prices while providing half-assed service for their customers.

143
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,540
A barbershop isn't just for cutting hair.

144
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,730
It's a place for people to interact with one another.

145
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,950
In the old days, you could go to a barbershop and learn everything about the town.

146
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,290
People would gather to have fun.

147
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,320
I cared more about that aspect than being fashionable or whatnot.

148
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,810
You can cut through hair, but you can never cut through the bonds between human beings.

149
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,270
Here, the complete collection of Abu-san.

150
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,240
Thanks, Master.

151
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,050
And in the end, curious fellas like you guys were the only ones that still came around.

152
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,750
Yeah, the world's become a hard place to live in.

153
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,840
Pops...

154
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,500
Uh, enough of that crap already.

155
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,850
Could you cut my hair already?

156
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,130
Don't worry.

157
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,560
We don't come here for the sole purpose of getting our hair cut.

158
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,300
We also come to see you, Pops.

159
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,620
Ooh, you sure know how to make this old man happy.

160
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,730
Right, right.

161
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,480
But we're also here to get our hair cut, so cut my hair.

162
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,510
Human interaction is important.

163
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,070
But...

164
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,650
Master, volume 7 of Abu-san is missing.

165
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,460
What?!

166
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,780
You know, this is a barbershop, so you should cut my hair.

167
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,620
You're right.

168
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,790
Abu-san volume 7 is missing!

169
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,640
What is going on here?!

170
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,570
I don't see it anywhere.

171
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,420
I-Impossible...

172
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,570
Why volume 7...

173
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,520
Yeah, can you stop talking about Abu-san and cut my hair?

174
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,890
Then I'll go run and buy volume 7!

175
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,020
Look after the store for me!

176
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,680
Roger!

177
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,020
Cut my hair!

178
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:09,520
"A conversation with a barber, during a haircut, is the most pointless thing in the world"

179
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,720
Where's Pops?

180
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,320
He went to buy volume 7 of Abu-san so he should be back soon.

181
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,650
He told us to look after the store for him.

182
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,130
Abu-san!

183
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,180
There probably won't be any customers, so we should be fine.

184
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,790
Why would a barber ditch his customer to go buy Abu-san?

185
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,540
Why do I have to put up with this when I came here to get a haircut?

186
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
Wow, the place across the street is so popular.

187
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
I wonder if there's anything we can do.

188
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,810
At this rate, this shop will really go out of business.

189
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,260
Well, yeah!

190
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,380
That guy doesn't give a damn about being a barber or human interaction or anything!

191
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,920
He only cares about Abu-san!

192
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,940
Huh?

193
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,280
From the back, that looks like...

194
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,520
It's Kondo-san.

195
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,270
I wonder what he's doing over there.

196
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,410
He's walking back and forth in front of the salon.

197
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,260
What's that gorilla doing?

198
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,490
Don't tell me he wants to get a makeover.

199
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,770
He wants to shed his gorilla skin and become a higher-evolved gorilla?

200
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,090
Oh, he's going in.

201
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,410
Huh? He turned back.

202
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,480
Oh, he's going in.

203
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Huh? He's not going in.

204
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,350
Huh? Is this the right place?

205
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,500
Did I make a mistake...

206
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,500
Hey, look at him.

207
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,940
He's scared stiff.

208
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,540
He came to get a makeover, but the salon's so fancy that he's scared to go in.

209
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,330
Moron.

210
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,000
That's more sad than pathetic...

211
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,940
I feel like rooting for him.

212
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,770
Oh, an employee came out.

213
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,270
Do you need something?

214
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,990
Ah! Excuse me!

215
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,960
I-I heard that a n-new barbershop was built around here!

216
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
So, I wanted to f-find it!

217
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,540
D-Do you know where it is?

218
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,000
I-I happen to be d-desperately looking for a new b-barbershop!

219
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,990
You know it's the place.

220
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,970
Just go in already.

221
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,140
Just get to the point.

222
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,890
I don't know if it's new or not, but there's a barbershop across the street.

223
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,350
He was denied!

224
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,680
He was casually denied access and directed to a different shop!

225
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,450
The gorilla was just dissed.

226
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,630
You were just dissed, gorilla.

227
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,390
Dissed gorilla.

228
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,490
Huh?

229
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,710
Uh...

230
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,800
Is that right?

231
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,200
The one over there.

232
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,530
He's tearing up!

233
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,170
It hurts to watch him!

234
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,410
Stop! Stop!

235
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,060
But it looks like people are getting their hair cut here, so maybe I should try this one.

236
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,370
Actually, this one looks better...

237
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,950
Ah, sorry, but we're a factory that makes brushes out of hair.

238
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,100
Now he's being lied to!

239
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,200
Being denied with a blatant lie!

240
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,680
Seriously, they really don't want him inside!

241
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,650
Oh, brushes...

242
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,290
So that's it.

243
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,490
But yeah, I wouldn't mind my hair being used for brushes...

244
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,100
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

245
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,900
Yesterday, we turned into a place that's researching

246
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,900
how to use the protein in hair to make meat and soy sauce.

247
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,660
Ah, protein...?

248
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,100
Ah, meat...

249
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,130
In that case, you can use my hair!

250
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,680
See? Nice and healthy!

251
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,570
It's so hard it gives me trouble!

252
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,620
Ah, sorry.

253
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,310
And yeah, can I just give it to you straight?

254
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,540
You're scaring the other customers,

255
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,120
so could you stop hanging around here?

256
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,920
I really don't want to say this,

257
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,920
but stalking is despicable.

258
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,420
No! No! No! No!

259
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,590
What?!

260
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,460
No, hold on!

261
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,520
Huh?!

262
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,290
Please wait!

263
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,550
Usually, it's...

264
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,900
But this time...

265
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,410
I'm going to call the cops.

266
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,310
Huh? Wait...

267
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,550
The cops...?

268
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,030
I'm a cop...

269
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,160
Hey, give it up already, old-timer.

270
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,930
Get lost!

271
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,020
I'll crush you for real.

272
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,510
Get lost! Get lost! Get lost! Get lost!

273
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,760
Huh?

274
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,640
Am I crying?

275
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,320
What is this feeling?

276
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,150
It's really uncomfortable.

277
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,750
What is this?

278
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,980
What are we supposed to do?

279
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,110
What should we do?

280
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,220
Hey?

281
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,600
This is terrible!

282
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,980
You have to feel bad for him this time!

283
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm gonna go beat the crap out of those people!

284
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,640
No, that won't do.

285
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,450
Huh?

286
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,280
Listen up.

287
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,700
Men are stupid creatures who have a need to put on airs.

288
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,560
If we go help him out of this ugly situation,

289
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,810
the gorilla will lose face, right?

290
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,980
We'll pretend that we didn't see anything.

291
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,370
We didn't see anything today.

292
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,510
Got it?

293
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,280
Uh, Gin-san.

294
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,560
Kondo-san's coming over here...

295
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,060
What? He's coming?

296
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,260
Hold on!

297
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,290
This is going to be awkward!

298
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,810
I have no idea how to deal with him!

299
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,100
We can't just make fun of him like usual!

300
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,380
I don't want to finish him off when he's on the verge of death!

301
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,170
What do I do?!

302
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,310
What should I do?!

303
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,310
Excuse me.

304
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,990
I don't have an appointment...

305
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,270
Is that okay?

306
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,390
Oh, a customer?

307
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,820
Excuse me.

308
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,650
I don't have an appointment...

309
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,770
Is that okay?

310
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,060
Oh, a customer?

311
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,300
Sorry, we're booked for the day.

312
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,520
Could you come back tomorrow?

313
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,700
Oh, really...

314
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,300
Even a dirty place like this won't even take me.

315
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,390
I'm like a gravely ill patient being tossed from hospital to hospital like a hot potato.

316
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,190
Wait, maybe I'm already dead and I just haven't realized it yet...

317
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,930
Ah! Wait! Wait!

318
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,670
We were just on the phone and everyone's canceled!

319
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,140
You're so lucky, Mister!

320
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,020
Come in! Come in!

321
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,420
Oh? It's okay?

322
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,750
Of course! Of course!

323
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,470
Come on! Sit down over here!

324
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,720
What are you guys doing?!

325
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,710
It's impossible!

326
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,740
I can't do it!

327
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,590
I can't turn him away!

328
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,760
What do you mean, you can't turn him away?!

329
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,530
Do you either of you know how to cut someone's hair?

330
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,830
You're good with your hands, Gin-chan, so you should be able to do it.

331
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,480
You bring him in by yourself and make me do the hard work?!

332
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,720
We have to do something for him!

333
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,880
I feel so bad for him.

334
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,580
We can't turn him away like this!

335
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,740
It'll work out somehow!

336
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,170
We can do this if we work together!

337
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,930
That's right!

338
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,830
Dreams can come true!

339
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,640
Why are you trying to sound like that "time does not betray dreams" stuff?!

340
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,830
[Note: This is a phrase by Leiji Matsumoto. He has sued Noriyuki Makihara for using this phrase in a song.]

341
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,100
Uh...

342
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,830
Oh, sorry!

343
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,040
Thank you for waiting.

344
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,850
My hair is in your hands.

345
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,970
Let's see...

346
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,150
How short do you want it today?

347
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,230
Uh, how short do I want it?

348
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,620
Why are you assuming that I want it short?!

349
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,210
No, you've got it wrong.

350
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm not saying that I can only do short haircuts or anything.

351
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,630
You just had a look on your face like you wanted it short.

352
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,830
No, I don't want it short.

353
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,930
Uh, I'm looking for a complete makeover today.

354
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,850
I see. A makeover.

355
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,910
It feels like everybody around me is good-looking,

356
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,300
and they've always got girls screaming over them.

357
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,380
Meanwhile, I can't even get the girl I like to talk to me.

358
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,970
I never get any gifts either

359
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,530
I just couldn't stand it anymore,

360
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,920
so I wanted to try starting over from scratch...

361
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,490
Break down the man known as Isao Kondo until he's completely unrecognizable

362
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,720
and be reborn as a totally new Isao Kondo.

363
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,810
Understood!

364
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,780
I'll break you down!

365
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,160
No! No! No!

366
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,560
It was just a metaphor.

367
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,140
When I said break down, I meant to wash away this untrendy image.

368
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,380
And then, I want to become a completely different character. Like I'm somebody else!

369
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,760
Like you're somebody else...

370
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,260
Okay, okay. I got it.

371
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,740
Then in SF2 terms,

372
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,610
[Note: Street Fighter II the video game.]

373
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,890
it'd be like changing from Blanka to Zangief.

374
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,990
No! That's barely any change!

375
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,140
You're going from one character nobody uses to another character nobody uses!

376
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,980
In SF2 terms,

377
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,140
it'd be like changing from E. Honda to Guile.

378
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,610
Ah, so you want something like changing your nationality.

379
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,770
Yeah! Something big!

380
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,670
Got it.

381
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,180
This will be a pretty big job,

382
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,100
so for today, I'll just shave your face and shorten your hair

383
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,020
before you go home for the day and come back tomorrow.

384
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,580
Why?!

385
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,960
Why do I have to get my hair shortened and then go home?!

386
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,750
There won't be anything left to do tomorrow!

387
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,200
You're just shortening my hair!

388
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,500
I already said that I don't need it shortened!

389
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,810
Just forget about that already.

390
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,390
But you said you wanted Guile.

391
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,240
Guile has close-cropped hair.

392
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,380
I didn't mean that I wanted to look like Guile!

393
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,440
And weren't you the one who started using SF2 examples?!

394
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,530
Uh...

395
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,690
It would help if you could tell us how you want to look or give us a model or example of some sort.

396
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,870
Do you have a picture from a magazine or something?

397
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,460
Yeah, I do.

398
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,640
Ah, then please show us.

399
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,560
Something like this.

400
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
No! That's physically impossible!

401
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,220
The length of your hair is totally different!

402
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,350
No, it's not just the hair...

403
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,040
I want to become a man that oozes beauty.

404
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,810
Uh, this is a barbershop.

405
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,930
I want to become a man that's soft and supple instead of ragged.

406
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,640
You should go to Shocker headquarters instead of a barbershop.

407
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,640
[Note: Shocker is an evil organization from Kamen Rider.]

408
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,770
Okay, I understand.

409
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,510
I'll do what I can to match this.

410
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,430
We'll start by coming up with a plan.

411
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,390
We'll shave your face in the meantime.

412
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,310
Ah, yes. Please do.

413
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,630
Hey, what do we do about this, Gin-san?

414
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,750
We'd have to change his entire physique.

415
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,240
Well, he seems to want to change his image rather than get a haircut.

416
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,810
So we'll have to change his hairstyle to change his image.

417
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,810
Excuse me.

418
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:35,920
This may sound awkward, but I heard that I could find a charismatic hairdresser of rare caliber here...

419
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,750
Th-This is terrible!

420
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,990
The most violent pair of rivals just ran into each other!

421
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,230
I'll steam your face!

422
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,620
It's a little hot, so bear with me!

423
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,830
Uh...

424
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,020
What did you want again?

425
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,820
Well, you see. I want to get a makeover.

426
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,810
So I need a charismatic hairdresser to cut my hair.

427
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,190
As usual, what is this guy doing?!

428
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,340
But that's a relief. He hasn't noticed.

429
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,940
I need to chase him out of here before things get ugly!

430
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,180
You can find charismatic hairdressers across the street!

431
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,720
Wow!

432
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,720
Get lost, moron!

433
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,370
Hey! Hey!

434
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,310
We're working here!

435
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,390
Cut that out!

436
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,780
Want me to give you a buzz-cut?

437
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,310
Shoo. Shoo.

438
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:15,890
Get lost, scumface!

439
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,730
Did you think you could fool me?

440
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,950
Your desperate efforts cannot deceive my eyes.

441
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,020
Did he notice...?!

442
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,810
You are

443
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,210
the charismatic hairdresser!

444
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,210
No, I'm not...

445
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,050
You are.

446
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,850
I can tell by looking in your eyes.

447
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,090
The eyes of one who has mastered a craft by dedicating his all...

448
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,170
The eyes of a samurai who has seen many battles...

449
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,940
Yeah, that's cause I'm a samurai.

450
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,170
Here we are, meeting for the first time, yet I feel as if I've known you for a hundred years.

451
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,510
Yeah, we know each other.

452
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,220
Could you cut my hair?

453
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,090
It's a pain to shampoo when it's this long.

454
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,020
Ah! Please don't go in without permission!

455
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,890
It hurts!

456
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,850
Hey! What are you doing?!

457
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,520
I can't breathe!

458
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,580
Ah, don't be in such a rush.

459
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,610
We'll wash your head for you.

460
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,260
Huh? Is he okay over there?

461
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,600
That looks more like torture than washing his hair.

462
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,710
Okay.

463
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,440
Don't turn your head.

464
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,350
I'll be shaving your face, so that's dangerous.

465
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,370
M-Mr. Charismatic Hairdresser!

466
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,000
I can see that everything done by a charismatic hairdresser is different,

467
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,090
down to the application of shampoo!

468
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,270
Yes. That's what they all say.

469
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,850
It's so intense that it feels like my hair roots are on fire!

470
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,770
I can't open my eyes because they're stinging from the shampoo!

471
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,070
You don't need to open them!

472
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,750
Then we'll allow the shampoo to permeate your hair for a while.

473
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,000
Just sit still with your eyes closed.

474
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,760
Huh? Like this?

475
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,570
What's the effect of letting the shampoo permeate my hair?

476
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,410
It prevents any stupid movements.

477
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,310
What?! It can do that?!

478
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,180
That was close.

479
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,560
They almost made contact.

480
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,010
What are we going to do, Gin-san?

481
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,770
Don't tell me that we have to handle them both?

482
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,470
We're going to leave now.

483
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,030
Huh?!

484
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,530
Just think about it.

485
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,150
There is no reason for us to work so hard for them.

486
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,020
If we stay, we'll only get dragged into more trouble.

487
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
No, but...

488
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Pops told us to look after the place for him...

489
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,290
He'll be back with his "Abu-san" soon enough.

490
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,930
He can handle the rest...

491
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,300
Oh, are you there?

492
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,520
Sorry I'm late.

493
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,210
I came to return volume 7 of Abu-san.

494
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,430
Huh? He's not here?

495
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,640
That's...

496
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,000
Katakuriko, what is this place?

497
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,230
Hmm? The barbershop I frequent.

498
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,740
I was going to introduce you to my buddy, but he doesn't seem to be here.

499
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,030
Heh, oh well.

500
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,930
Let's just go hit a hostess bar.

501
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,390
Would he do my hair in a Mage...?

502
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,940
What kind of Mage would he do...?

503
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,750
Th-That's...

504
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,300
That's...

505
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,230
Fascinating.

506
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,750
Will you do my hair in a Mage?

507
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,050
Th-The Shogun?!

508
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,960
[To Be Continued]

509
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:15,020
[Preview]

510
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,080
I-It's impossible, big man!

511
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,370
I can't touch the Shogun's Mage!

512
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:10,790
Impossible!

513
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,500
Absolutely impossible!

514
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,430
You handle the rest!

515
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,080
Wait!

516
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,010
It's impossible for me, too!

517
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,870
The next episode...

518
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,020
"The heavens created Chonmage above man instead of another man."

519
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,020
[Note: A phrase by Yukichi Fukuzawa "Heaven doesn't make a man better than others, nor does it make a man worse than others." = all men are created equal.]

520
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,520
[The Great Shogun Shigeshige Tokugawa came to the barbershop!]

521
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,930
[He's a General, but his you-know-what's a Private.]

522
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,550
[See you next time!]
