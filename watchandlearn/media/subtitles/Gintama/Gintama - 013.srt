Hello!

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,730
It's Katsura.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,320
Nobody home? And time is of the essence.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,760
Ex-Excuse me... Is Mr. Gintoki home?

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,330
Well, I brought some sweets as a token of... I'll just leave them here then.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,940
Enjoy.

[Gin had too much to drink and has a hangover. It's a little more watery than usual, but...]

["If You're Going to Cosplay, Go All Out"]

11
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,040
Well, it's not unlike her to disappear for two or three days in a row...

12
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,490
but she's been missing a whole week.

13
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,880
There's been no word from her, and I've asked her friends, but no one knows where she is.

14
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,630
Pull yourself together.

15
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,540
That's why I told you not to drink so much.

16
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,120
I know it sounds odd for me, her father, to say this,

17
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,880
but she's a beautiful girl, so I'm worried she's gotten mixed up in something dreadful.

18
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,550
Yes, I agree.

19
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,940
I'd say there's a good chance

20
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,540
she got caught up in some sorta huge ham-processing machine or something.

21
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,670
No, that's not what I meant. I'm thinking she's caught up in some sort of trouble.

22
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,060
Trouble? Oh, like ham-processing trouble?

23
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,910
Hey, that's enough already. Are trying to ruin this deal?

24
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,660
But are you sure you want us to handle this?

25
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,350
Sounds like a matter for the police.

26
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,270
I can't afford a public scandal.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,030
Our family is of an ancient and honorable lineage

28
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,070
that has served the Tokugawa Family since the time the Shogunate was formed.

29
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,800
The entire clan will be shamed if it gets out that my precious darling

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,280
is a club-hopping skank.

31
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,650
Please, just bring her back home to me...and keep this quiet.

32
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,090
Huh? Never seen her.

33
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,950
Someone said she parties here all the time.

34
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,180
Maybe that's what someone told you, young lady.

35
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,460
But all Earthlings look alike to me!

36
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,480
She got a name?

37
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,280
Um...Ha...Hammy?

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,070
That's a lie! You just made that up.

39
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,720
Who would give their kid a crappy name like that?!

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,920
I forgot her name, okay? It's something like that, I think.

41
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,430
Hey! Are you messing with me?!

42
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,630
Gin, we'll never finish this job if we leave it up to Kagura.

43
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,370
Yeah, whatever.

44
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,240
She's just some slut who's probably camping out some dude's house.

45
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,850
This is retarded.

46
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,030
I can't take this job seriously.

47
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,070
Let's buy a big ham and give it to her dad.

48
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,840
He'll never know the difference.

49
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,730
There's no way you could do that!

50
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,920
And how long are you going to keep milking that ham joke!

51
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,300
Sorry, but I've got a hangover and I feel like crap.

52
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,580
Just take care of it, will ya, Shin.

53
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,820
Wait, Gin!

54
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

55
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,670
Kid, watch where you're going.

56
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,880
You have the gall to walk around with dust on your shoulder.

57
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,980
You oughta pay a bit more attention to your appearance.

58
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,470
Who was that guy?

59
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,460
Shinpachi!

60
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm bo-red!  This fella looks kinda like her.  Let's use him.

61
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,130
Sheesh, nobody is taking this job seriously!

62
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,000
Anyway, there's no way you can pass this guy off as her!

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,850
This isn't even a "Hammy." What you've got here, it's a "Ham-ilton"!

64
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,130
Tsk, eat one ham, you've eaten them all. Shit!

65
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,580
Hah? Going through a rebellious stage?

66
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,470
Ham-man!

67
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,750
Hey, don't waste a scene on a minor character!

68
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,390
Ham-man, you drank too much.

69
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,270
This dude...he's not drunk.

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,060
Okay, never mind, never mind.

71
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,290
I'll take it from here. You people go away.

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Good grief. Everybody's gone shabu shabu on me, I swear.

73
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,320
Shabu shabu?

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,250
Isn't that that high-leg place?

75
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,670
There's a new drug on the streets.

76
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,440
Real nasty stuff I hear. Just say no, kids!

77
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,880
I'm never drinking again.

78
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,280
I always say that, but this time, I mean it...

79
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,490
Who should I swear to?

80
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,720
I'll swear to that hot weather girl.

81
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,160
Yes, I'm in here...

82
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,440
Give me the usual.

83
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Huh?

84
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,460
I said hurry up and give me the usual stuff!

85
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,810
I can't go on without it!

86
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,920
The...The usual stuff, you say?

87
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,940
It's a little more watery than usual.

88
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,860
Don't jerk me around!

89
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,240
I'm not welcome now that I'm broke?!

90
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,340
Fine, be that way! I'll go to the cops.

91
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,830
Huh? Tell the cops? Hold on a minute.

92
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,030
Not that I care...But about what?

93
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,490
Who the hell're you talking to, fool?

94
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,030
I have no use for you anymore, piggy!

95
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,980
Who the hell are you?

96
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,170
Gin sure is taking long.

97
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,310
I've got a bad feeling about this place...

98
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,120
We should leave as soon as we can.

99
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,160
I'll go find him.

100
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,500
Are you the jerks who've been snooping around here?

101
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,560
Wh-Who are you guys?

102
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,990
Don't play dumb with us.

103
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,730
You've been pokin' your noses where they don't belong, haven't cha?

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,580
If you're so interested in our business, we'll show you

105
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,090
how frightening the Harusame space pirates can be!

106
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,040
Give it to me. Hurry!

107
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,810
Hammy!

108
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,040
Sorry about that.

109
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,330
Of the all the men to get mixed up with...

110
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,170
you got caught up with the worst of them all.

111
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,770
Daraku, we've got a weird one here.

112
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,460
Whatta we do?

113
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,630
Are you listening?

114
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,050
Damn! Can't get it off.

115
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,030
What're you going to do about this?!

116
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,640
This jacket is tailored!

117
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,900
How filthy! It's all sticky and won't come off!

118
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,740
Yo, Daraku, are you listening-

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,370
I told you not to bother me when I'm grooming!

120
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,980
If you've got a problem,

121
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,370
just take care of it.

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,340
Do it snappily and let's go back.

123
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,850
There's a rerun of a show I want to watch tonight

124
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,360
Me, too...

125
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,890
I'm not really a violent mysoginist.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,330
But there are three things I can't abide.

127
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,160
1. People who interfere with my work.

128
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,470
2. People who don't wash up after using the toilet.

129
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,850
3. Scuzzy-looking people with naturally wavy hair.

130
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,490
And you're...

131
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,200
...three for three, creep!

132
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm honored.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,350
While we're sharing,

134
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,990
how 'bout I tell you the three kinds of people I can't stand?

135
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,010
First!

136
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,830
Girls who get hysterical while preparing for school festivals!

137
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,330
Second!

138
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,740
Totally dumbass guys who take advantage of that and pretend to get all excited about festivals!

139
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,700
Third!

140
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,830
Teachers who smile and condescendingly embrace it all.

141
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,790
In other words,

142
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,780
you hate school festivals, right?

143
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,360
You must've had an unhappy adolescence.

144
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,640
Better than yours.

145
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,480
Aren't you a little old to be sneaking a puff in the john?

146
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,930
Of course, it seems you guys are into some serious poison.

147
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,250
Since you Amanto arrived, there've been a lot more dangerous things in the world.

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,800
Can't have you pushing drugs on our kids.

149
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,630
"Pushing"?

150
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,050
Miss Piggy's the one who came running to me.

151
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,750
I just gave her what she wanted, but she cried and made a scene.

152
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,170
She was causing me trouble.

153
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,110
I see.

154
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,210
I'm sorry this silly girl caused you trouble.

155
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,590
I'll take her home and give her a good talking to!

156
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,490
Hey, hey. Are you all here to take a leak together?

157
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,550
There aren't enough toilets.

158
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,230
Hey, don't make this difficult.

159
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,480
Shinpachi! Kagura! Hey! What're they doing?!

160
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,380
Bastards! What did you do to them?!

161
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,900
You disgust me.

162
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,130
Dirty again. It's definitely ruined now.

163
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,760
I'll just have to buy a new one.

164
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,630
Hang in there!

165
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,840
I won't let you die on me.

166
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,160
I'll get you through this, you'll see!

167
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,300
Get rid of it. Dump him.

168
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,040
He ain't gonna make it, anyway.

169
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,280
You don't have what it takes to rescue anyone.

170
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,820
When have you ever managed to protect anything that really matters?

171
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,440
All you do is lash out at whatever's in front of you.

172
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,280
You slew them all, and what did that leave you?

173
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,390
Nothing but a mountain of corpses.

174
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,470
You're powerless.

175
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,860
Just throw it all away. Take the easy road.

176
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,500
There's nothing you can protect!

177
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,600
It's unlike you to be having a nightmare.

178
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,780
Dreaming about the past?

179
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,690
Zura? What the hell are you doing here?

180
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,290
I remember now!

181
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,960
Better not strain yourself.

182
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,870
You can't use your left arm, and I'm told you've broken several ribs.

183
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,500
The other person is even worse.

184
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,040
She looks okay on the outside. You broke her fall.

185
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,050
But her entire body has been ravaged by drugs.

186
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,440
She was lucky that she was treated quickly, but it's unclear whether she'll recover.

187
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,190
Stupid kid...

188
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,360
But what were you doing in a dive like that?

189
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,950
Never mind that, how did you manage to save me?

190
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,950
Apologize for last time, you bastard.

191
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,780
Speaking of which...

192
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,310
...are you familiar with this?

193
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,330
It's an illegal drug called "Paradise" that's been going around lately.

194
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,490
It's made from a flower that grows only on a remote planet.

195
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,330
It's very addictive.

196
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,150
And everyone who uses it without exception, meets a tragic end.

197
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,510
The Anti-Amanto party is working on digging out this evil by its roots.

198
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,720
So we're gathering information on it.

199
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,490
That's apparently where you fell into all of this.

200
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,790
Who knows what would have happened to you if my men hadn't found you.

201
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,220
But what were you doing in a dive like that?

202
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,360
More importantly, who were those guys?

203
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,820
The Harusame space pirates.

204
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,420
They're the largest organized crime syndicate in the Milky Way.

205
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,140
Their main source of income is profits from the sale of illegal drugs.

206
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,130
The very tips of their tentacles have reached Earth.

207
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,730
We can't rely on the government police. They're totally corrupted by the Amanto.

208
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,950
We hoped we could do something on our own.

209
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,870
They were able to corner even you.

210
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,060
They seem to be a very formidable adversary.

211
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,870
We might be acting prematurely.

212
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,690
Hey.

213
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,860
Are you listening?

214
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,970
They kidnapped my friends. I can't afford to rest and bide my time.

215
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,910
You think you can beat them in your condition?

216
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,770
"A man's life is like traveling a long road with a load on his shoulders."

217
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,870
A long time ago, an old man named Nobuhide Tokugawa said that...

218
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,240
Learn your history, retard! It was Lord Ieyasu. Lord Ieyasu!

219
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,310
The first time I heard that, I thought, what a lame thing to say,

220
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,160
but what do you know, that old guy had a point.

221
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,680
It's not really a burden.

222
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,410
Everyone's got both hands full of something that matters.

223
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,330
You just don't realize it when you're carrying it.

224
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,740
It's only after it slips out of your hands that you realize how heavy it was in the first place.

225
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,350
So many times, I thought I'd never carry a load like that ever again.

226
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,510
And yet,

227
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,630
before I realized it, I was carrying it again.

228
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,320
I'd feel so much better if I just got rid of it.

229
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,930
But I just can't bring myself to do it.

230
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,060
Without those guys, just walking around isn't fun anymore.

231
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,380
I guess there's no point in arguing.

232
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,920
I still owe you a favor from Ikedaya.

233
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,010
Let's go.

234
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,260
You can't carry that load with just one hand.

235
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,340
Starting now, I'm your left arm.

236
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,600
Where is this place?

237
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,090
What am I doing right now?

238
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Are these the ones who were snooping around?

239
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,930
Yeah.

240
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,400
They were becoming a bit of a nuisance, so we set a trap.

241
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,160
They fell right into it.

242
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,250
They are most likely rebels who hate the Amanto.

243
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,180
Ribbit. Ribbit.

244
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,440
There was one other odd samurai,

245
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,670
but we got rid of him together with a loud-mouthed customer.

246
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,850
I told you not to attract too much attention.

247
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,190
There's a limit to how much we can keep the government officials

248
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,930
under control and have them look the other way.

249
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,630
Yes, I understand.

250
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,710
We are only able to do business thanks to your magnanimity, my lord.

251
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,790
So, how're you going to dispose of these two?

252
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll get the location of their headquarters out of them, and destroy it.

253
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,800
I don't want them interfering any further with our work.

254
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,240
The leader is probably that man named Katsura.

255
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,260
They're mad dogs that have even bared their teeth at the government.

256
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,400
Don't take them lightly.

257
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,180
Daraku, a moment please?

258
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,660
There are some weirdos outside.

259
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,050
Weirdos?

260
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,650
You handle it. I'm busy right now.

261
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,480
I'm telling you again...we don't need any of your crap!

262
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,890
Aw c'mon.

263
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,570
We want to become pirates, too.

264
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,540
Take us with you.

265
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,760
Ain't that right, Zura?

266
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,900
It's not Zura. It's Captain Katsura.

267
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,530
Ever since we were little punk kids, we've dreamed of becoming pirates.

268
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,880
We wanna search for the lost treasure: "One Park."

269
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Right, Zura?

270
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,240
It's not Zura. It's Captain Katsura.

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,550
Never heard of it. Go find it yourselves.

272
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,280
Don't be like that. My hand's a hook.

273
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,630
I can only be a pirate or coat hanger.

274
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,690
Whatever. You go be whatever you want to be.

275
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,540
Anyway, go home

276
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,200
This isn't a job fair.

277
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,700
At least give us an interview.

278
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,580
See, we even brought our resumes.

279
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,330
Hey, are you awake, kid?

280
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,080
Sleepy time's over!

281
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,720
You're so young. Such a shame you got captured by pirates!

282
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,210
Oh, that's right...

283
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,830
I've been captured by pirates.

284
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,680
Kagura!

285
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:08,130
I hate filthy scum who interfere with my business.

286
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,410
So now I want to clean out you pesky rats.

287
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,680
Tell me where your nest is.

288
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,570
If you try to hold out, she dies.

289
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,300
What're you talking about?!

290
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,070
Don't play dumb. We know you're a rebel.

291
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,850
Tell us where your secret base of operations is!

292
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,320
Where is that scum Katsura?!

293
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,240
What're you guys talking about?!

294
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,780
We're not exclusionist rebels, nor do we know where Katsura is!

295
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,260
Let Kagura go! This is the land of the samurai!

296
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,930
You guys get out!

297
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,380
Samurai, you say? There's no such thing in this country.

298
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,310
Kagura!

299
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,020
Don't want to get in your way.

300
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,180
Bye-bye.

301
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,500
Wait!

302
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,800
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

303
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,300
Oww... My wound opened up.

304
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,210
Uh... Is this where the interview is being held?

305
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,530
Hello, I'm Gintoki Sakata. I'd like to try out for captain.

306
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,530
My hobby is eating sugar.

307
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,410
My special talent is being able to sleep with my eyes open.

308
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,210
Gin!

309
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,510
You little bastard...still alive, eh?

310
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,030
What the?!

311
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,660
Daraku! There was an explosion in the storeroom!

312
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,760
The Paradises!

313
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,400
My work here is done.

314
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,850
You're up, Gintoki!

315
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,130
Go ahead and trash the place to your heart's content.

316
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,970
I'll take care of anybody who gets in your way.

317
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,710
You're...Katsura!

318
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,080
No!

319
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,210
I'm Captain Katsura!

320
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,870
It's Katsura! Get him!

321
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,100
Off with Katsura's head!

322
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,910
You're finished now, bastards.

323
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,360
You've made an enemy of the entire Harusame gang!

324
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,160
Soon, Harusame from throughout the universe will come to kill you.

325
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,200
Yeah? So What? You won't be around to see it.

326
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,260
Listen... I don't care what you do somewhere else in the universe,

327
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,560
but anywhere within reach of my sword,

328
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,630
is my country!

329
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,320
Anyone who comes here and messes with my people

330
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,610
whether he's the Shogun, space pirates, a meteorite...

331
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,910
I'll cut 'em all down!

332
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,990
You know...

333
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,140
Bastard...you may not wash your hands in the bathroom,

334
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,080
but you're pretty clean.

335
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,760
Hoo, I'm beat. Everything's spinning. I can't even walk straight.

336
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,590
I'm dizzy from too much sun.

337
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,260
Carry me.

338
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,870
What're you complaining for, you little brats!

339
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,980
Do you know who's the most exhausted?!

340
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,240
I fought my way over here even though my body is a mess and I have a hangover!

341
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,940
Both of us are woozy, too, you know!

342
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,080
That's right! Boozy!

343
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,650
I can't stand you guys. I'm going on home.

344
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,150
Come on, knock it off already!

345
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,260
Okay! Fine! You want me to carry you, I'll carry you! Your wish is my command!

346
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,420
What a miraculous recovery! Damn you!

347
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,440
Gin, I feel like eating ramen.

348
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,870
Sushi for me.

349
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,300
Stupid! You don't get that except on your birthday.

350
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,250
Man... You guys are heavy, dammit.

351
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,900
Now that you've got them back, hold on tight.

352
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,270
Kimiko... Kimiko!

353
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,170
I'm so glad you're safe! Kimiko!

354
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,540
Hey, old man, wrong one!

355
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,040
I know how it is, pops. There are some things you never want people to see.

356
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,780
No, it's like this because he can see those things.

357
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,170
[Preview]

358
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,590
This is Gintoki.

359
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,400
The other day, I was chasing after a stray cat that stole my fish, naked.

360
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,720
Everyone under the sun, even a little dog, was laughing.

361
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,220
Anyway, the next episode:

362
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,040
Three episodes including "Men Have ... *snip*

363
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,030
["You Only Gotta Wash Under Your Armpits - Just the Armpits", "Rough cooking style for men"]

364
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:49,030
[Next time, we have 3 episodes like XXX-san. The revival of family-style animation?]

365
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,010
It's not Zura. It's Captain Katsuuura, believe it!

366
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,040
Did I mess up the punchline?
