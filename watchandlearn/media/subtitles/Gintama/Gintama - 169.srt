3
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,950
["The Chosen Idiots"]

4
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,130
That's Lady Tama's main system.

5
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,830
It's already been taken over by the viruses
and converted into their stronghold.

6
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,050
The brains behind the Tapir
and their extensive invasion

7
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,590
dwell inside-the Archfiend Tapir.

8
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,050
The progenitor of all the Tapir spreading
throughout Lady Tama's body.

9
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,300
The king of the Tapir.

10
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,820
We won't be able to stop the Tapir
invasion unless we destroy him.

11
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,810
To return peace to this world...

12
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,730
To save Lady Tama...

13
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,000
We must defeat him.

14
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,720
The Archfiend Tapir is like the
main system for the Tapir.

15
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,010
Destroying him should render
the Tapir powerless.

16
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,480
The problem is how we're going
to reach the Archfiend Tapir.

17
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,360
As you would expect of the
enemy's main base...

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,700
Black bodysuits everywhere you look.

19
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,430
And they all look stronger than
the ones we've fought before.

20
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,370
This is the Archfiend Tapir's territory.

21
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,560
The place is swarming with the latest viruses
created by the Archfiend Tapir.

22
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,970
They won't be easy to defeat like before.

23
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,810
We'll need to come up with a plan.

24
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,850
Come on now.

25
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,070
Give me a break.

26
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,930
Why slow down after coming this far?

27
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,130
Those new viruses are just pseudo
DQ characters that spawned from

28
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,970
the virus eating her DQ-crazed brain.

29
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,340
Like this guy.

30
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,010
We don't need a plan to
deal with these freaks.

31
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,040
Just go on a rampage.

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,760
Wait!

33
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,370
Only the most foolish of fools
would suggest "rampaging"

34
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,710
straight into the Archfiend
Tapir's stronghold!

35
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:33,230
A party with you as its leader would run
out of MP before reaching the Archfiend

36
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,190
and be forced to jot down a long resurrection
spell to even make it halfway there.

37
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,190
[Note: Parody of Dragon Quest III.]

38
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,360
What an idiot.

39
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,940
The party would be wiped out
if we followed your orders!

40
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,570
I am the hero who will save Lady Tama.

41
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,700
[Note: Parody of Jester class and Luida
character from Dragon Quest III.]

42
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,700
A Jester like you should go
goof off in Luida's bar!

43
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,760
Who are you calling a Jester, damn it?!

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,350
Sure, I might goof off!

45
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,060
But the son of Bianca and I will
become the Heavenly Hero!

46
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:01,670
[Note: Parody of "Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride." Bianca is one of two women whom the player can choose for the hero to marry.]

47
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,920
So I'm no ordinary Jester!

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,670
I'm the Heavenly Jester!

49
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,860
It would be best to avoid combat

50
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,090
before we reach the Archfiend
and conserve our health.

51
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,520
Use herbs to heal.

52
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,520
Hey! You listening to me, cosplay freak?!

53
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,260
We'll go with a "no magic" tactic.

54
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,730
Uh, we don't have any
magic to begin with.

55
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,570
How can we defeat the Archfiend
with such a conservative tactic?

56
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,930
Are you an idiot?

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,820
A stingy party led by you would
carry so many herbs

58
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,890
you wouldn't be able to open
any treasure chests

59
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,000
and get wiped out with full MP before
you even reach the Archfiend.

60
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,000
We should all use "Firevolt"
except for Kiryl.

61
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,000
[Note: Firevolt is a powerful spell.
Kiryl is a priest from Dragon Quest IV.]

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,990
I've never heard of that tactic!

63
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,920
Who's Kiryl?!

64
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,890
[Note: The Defeat spell one-hit kills enemies. Useless on bosses. Kiryl (aka Cristo) tried this spell on Archfiend in Dragon Quest IV.]

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,650
Kiryl is the Shinpachi-like character
that stupidly casts Defeat

66
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,890
on the Archfiend if you leave
him to his own devices.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
It's better to keep him silenced.

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,440
Are you trying to say I'm useless?

69
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,000
You don't even know how to use
Kiryl properly? Laughable.

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,940
It appears that you are unqualified
to lead this party.

71
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,150
Shut up.

72
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,900
You wanna live on a cart with
Kiryl, Borya, and Torneko?

73
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,670
Wanna live a gloomy life badmouthing
the best members behind their backs?

74
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,500
There they go again.

75
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,570
The two of them are hopeless.

76
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,970
Tama, do something.

77
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,300
Understood.

78
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,500
Then we'll compromise and go with "Keep
everyone except Kiryl healed up."

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,010
You want Kiryl to die?!

80
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,330
Was that directed at me?!

81
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,240
Am I that useless?!

82
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,310
Whatever then. We'll go with that.

83
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,070
Firevolt Kiryl.

84
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,290
Why are you being mean to Kiryl?!

85
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,390
You're attacking Kiryl now!!

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,130
Whatever then.

87
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,140
I'll settle for "no Kiryl."

88
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,330
You think Kiryl's a nuisance, too?!

89
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,740
This will never end if we leave
it to the stupid heroes.

90
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,950
I'll go draw them out.

91
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,620
The rest of you head for the castle.

92
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,560
Kagura-chan!

93
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,440
She's the real hero here!

94
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,200
That was damn ballsy!

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,250
Way cooler than some
other people I know!

96
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,750
Stop wasting time!

97
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,510
This is our only chance!

98
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,600
Let's go!

99
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,420
Wait!

100
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,060
The lead position is reserved
for the hero!

101
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,370
I am the hero who will save Lady Tama!

102
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,060
What do you think you're
doing, Mr. Cosplay Hero?

103
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,350
The party will be wiped out with
a psycho like you in the lead!

104
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,580
I'll do it!

105
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,960
A Jester should be getting
a puff-puff in Ashalam!

106
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,820
[Note: In Dragon Quest III a woman in Ashalam town
gives a "Puff-puff" (wiggles her boobs) service.]

107
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,790
I am the leader of this party!

108
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,150
Don't mess with me!

109
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,820
Loto, the hero, should get lost!

110

three Dragon Quest games.]

Quest IV, V and VI.]

112
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,220
This is the age of the Heavenly Hero!

113
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,410
Hey!

114
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,930
What are the two of you doing?!

115
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,510
We don't have time for this!

116
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,220
Did you just cast Defeat?!

117
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,000
You just cast Defeat, didn't you?! Hey!

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,020
What's wrong with the two of them?

119
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,980
They have the exact same face
yet they can't get along at all.

120
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,420
Tama-san, was that person
really based on Gin-san?

121
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,040
They hate each other's guts.

122
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,410
Forget about being the strongest combo!

123
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,240
They're the worst possible combo!

124
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,510
While cake and ramen both taste good,

125
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,940
combining them into cake ramen
will ruin the dish,

126
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,550
leaving you with something that
tastes absolutely horrible.

127

I may have made a terrible
miscalculation.

128

That's a fatal error!

You brought the two of them together
without even thinking it through?!

What are you trying to hit?!

160
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,590
[Dove]
[Note: Refers to Dove brand soap.]

161
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,590
Now for the finish!

162
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,100
[Mama Lemon]
[Note: A dishwashing detergent.]

163
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,160
What are they doing?!

164
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,810
This is crazy!

165
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,120
No, look.

166
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,590
The army of viruses are being
wiped out by their fighting.

167
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,630
I didn't make a mistake.

168
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,450
Those two are the strongest...

169
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,110
That's...

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,830
Their attacks are melding...

171
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,880
This is...

172
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,230
That light is...

173
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,050
[Kamikaze]
["Super explosion caused by a mixture of light and dark power. Burn away the enemy, your own party and everything. It's very dangerous so please don't aim at people. Only use this in wide open spaces. Do Not Eat."]
[Note: Parody of warning labels.]

174
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,270
Hey now.

175
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,880
Are those guys okay?

176
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,310
Who's the strongest duo again?

177
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,270
Those two are obviously

178
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,500
not meant to be mixed together.

179
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,500
[Note: Parody of warning label on detergents.]

180
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,300
It was a mistake to pair them together.

181
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,220
You know how they say you'll die
if you run into your doppelganger.

182
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,460
At this rate, they'll get
the rest of us killed.

183
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,610
But they were able to do significant
damage to the virus army

184
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,220
and we have managed
to infiltrate the castle.

185
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,080
It's as I planned.

186
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,420
Liar!

187
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,800
This is like reaching the boss with
your HP and MP in single digits!

188
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,500
The window is all red!

189
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,750
What are we supposed to do?!

190
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,800
Don't worry.

191
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,290
Many of the recent final bosses,
right before the final battle...

192
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,140
Show me everything you've got.

193
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,710
I'll kill you slowly.

194
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,580
...say stuff like that.

195
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,700
Often restoring all your HP and MP.

196
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,020
We'll count on that.

197
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,880
Why are you depending
on the final boss?!

198
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,170
Just to be clear, this isn't a game.

199
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,880
There aren't any save points
or resurrection spells.

200
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,840
Die once and it's over.

201
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,320
Could you please stop fighting?

202
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,650
This isn't the time to be
hurting one another.

203
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,870
Are you scared of dying?

204
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,300
Go ahead and turn tail and go home.

205
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,250
As I said in the beginning,

206
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,480
I can handle this myself.

207
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,790
Hey!

208
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,720
Why do you have to be so abrasive?

209
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,720
Gin-chan and you...

210
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,200
No, we're all the same.

211
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,650
It isn't just your appearance.

212
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,220
All of us have been protecting Tama
on the outside and the inside.

213
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,730
Why do you refuse to cooperate?

214
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,740
Don't you care if Tama breaks down?!

215
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,590
That's why I'm telling you to leave!

216
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,950
You all came here to save Lady Tama.

217
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,810
I know you all care deeply
for Lady Tama.

218
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,900
But because you feel that way...

219
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,770
Because you are willing to
risk your lives for a robot,

220
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,340
it means there are also other things

221
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,980
you strive to protect.

222
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,620
Things and people on the outside...

223
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,980
I'm different.

224
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,240
I was made for the sole purpose
of protecting Lady Tama.

225
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,900
I live to protect Lady Tama.

226
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,960
I don't care about what happens
to anyone besides Lady Tama.

227
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,700
I have no interest in anyone
but Lady Tama.

228
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,860
Looks like you're interested in something
else besides Lady Tama!

229
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,810
Why are you getting greedy and falling
for such a cheap booby trap?

230
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,150
D-Do you understand now?

231
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,470
I'll have no trouble protecting
Lady Tama by myself.

232
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,410
It sure doesn't look that way.

233
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,060
You look hopelessly unreliable!

234
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,350
Idiot!

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,970
I-I've been through more ordeals
than the lot of you.

236
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,720
Your whole life must have
been an ordeal.

237
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,300
It doesn't matter how many lives you have
if you keep falling for these cheap traps.

238
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,890
Leave if you understand!

239
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,630
Uh, then let go of me.

240
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,450
You've got one heck of an iron grip.

241
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,020
Leave after you've dealt with this!

242
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,650
Damn nuisances!

243
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,650
I am the only hero needed
to protect Lady Tama!

244
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,450
Isn't he just like you?

245
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,130
He has difficulty expressing himself...

246
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,690
He's antagonistic...

247
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,840
He's all based on you.

248
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,210
You see me as such a
shameless person?

249
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,310
As I observed you and collected data,

250
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,730
he evolved into someone
more human than I was.

251
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,750
That is why I could not stand by

252
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,230
and watch him die alone.

253
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,430
You should be able to understand...

254
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,950
Why he keeps telling you to
leave so he can go alone...

255
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,780
Why he acts so hostile...

256
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,560
Did you bring the two of us together so...

257
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,310
Hey! Your body's...

258
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,420
It appears... that the... Tapir...
have reached...

259
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,410
the backup system... that
created this copy...

260
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,020
There is... no time...

261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,820
Will you... listen... to my... final request?

262
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:26,360
It will... probably be... impossible
to... recover my... system...

263
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:35,200
The Tapir... are already... deep... inside...

264
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,630
At this... rate...

265
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,190
he won't... be able... to survive...

266
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,470
Forget... about... me...

267
00:15:53,050 --> 00:16:00,730
At least try... to free... him...
from this... place...

268
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:09,340
My fr...d... who has... protected
me... for so... long...

269
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:19,810
Protect... my oth...r... friend...

270
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,170
Tama...

271
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,790
Sorry, but I can't honor your request.

272
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,520
If he really is my clone,

273
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,520
he would never want that.

274
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,890
And I won't let anybody die.

275
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,170
Not your friends

276
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,150
and not mine.

277
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,590
Listen up!

278
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,000
Do not let a single rat
into the throne room!

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,570
The system of this world will soon
fall into our Tapir hands!

280
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,300
Until then, we must protect
the Archfiend Tapir!

281
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,960
Victory is within sight!

282
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,420
Now go forth!

283
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,080
Wh-What?!

284
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,960
That wasn't what I meant
when I said "go"!

285
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,800
I didn't mean for you to go and die!

286
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,750
Hey! Come back, guys!

287
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,830
Yo.

288
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,540
I've always wanted to ask something.

289
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,200
How does the Archfiend feel when
a level 99 Hero comes for him?

290
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,570
Does he feel like turning
tail and running?

291
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,190
Or does he try leveling himself up?

292
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,370
If that's the case, I would recommend
the Capillary Caves to the west.

293
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,570
[Note: A Dragon Quest monster.]

294
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,570
There's a high chance you'll run
into Liquid Metal Slimes viruses.

295
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,820
In the end, it doesn't matter
how many levels you gain.

296
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:29,350
'Cause when you multiply 99 by
2, you get a level 198 Hero.

297
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,480
Except I'm level 100.

298
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,370
I'm actually level 101.

299
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,900
No, I'm actually level 103.

300
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,530
This world has already fallen under
the absolute control of the Tapir.

301
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,080
You cannot change anything.

302
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,110
It's all over.

303
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,280
Can you not comprehend that?

304
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,650
It's not over.

305
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,790
One last security measure remains.

306
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,200
As long as I, the Leukocyte
King, am still here,

307
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,000
this world will continue to exist after all
the systems have been knocked out!

308
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,700
I will protect Lady Tama!

309
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:28,640
You truly believe you can defeat
me and save this world?

310
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,820
Leukocyte King...

311
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:38,430
No matter how many heroes you bring from
other worlds, you are powerless against me.

312
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,160
I guarantee it.

313
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,960
You cannot defeat me.

314
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,000
You cannot even harm me,
let alone defeat me!

315
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,990
Because you have fought to protect
this world for so long...

316
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,330
Because you love this world
more than anyone else...

317
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,650
You cannot defeat me.

318
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,230
Th-That's...

319
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,110
I-Impossible...

320
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,950
It's...

321
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,040
Lady Tama!

322
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,390
Wh-Wh-

323
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,840
What the...?!

324
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,090
Why is Tama-san here?!

325
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,300
Why is Tama-san the Archfiend?!

326
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,930
D-Damn you!

327
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,990
You've assumed Lady Tama's
appearance to confuse me!

328
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,050
I won't fall for such a cheap trick!

329
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,400
Leukocyte King!

330
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,140
I-I can't control my body...

331
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,740
I can't get near him...

332
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,190
As I said...

333
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,310
The systems of this world
are under our control.

334
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,650
This is no disguise.

335
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,550
This is my true form.

336
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,810
This body now belongs to me.

337
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,560
You are trying to fight against

338
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,430
the person you have been protecting.

339
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,150
As one who was created
to protect this world,

340
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,980
you cannot defy me.

341
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,480
So my body recognizes
you as Lady Tama

342
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,680
and refuses to attack?

343
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,560
Impossible...

344
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,610
How could this...?

345
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,920
As I said, it's all over.

346
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,470
Defeating me will destroy this world.

347
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,210
There is nothing left for you to protect.

348
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,110
Will you still try to defeat me?

349
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,640
Will you still try to destroy the virus even
if it means destroying this body?

350
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,380
Can you kill Tama?

351
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,650
Firebane!!

352
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,650
[Note:  A spell from Dragon Quest.]

353

[To Be Continued]

354
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:15,800
[Preview]

355
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,940
We are left with no options
as we face the

356
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,970
overwhelming power of
the Archfiend Tapir...

357
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,420
Our last hope lies in those two!

358
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,200
The next episode...

359
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
"Tama Quest IV: And Into the Legend..."

360
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
[Note: Parody of Dragon
Quest III subtitle.]

361
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,890
Uh, that's DQ III's subtitle.

362
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,270
[Tama Quest comes to its conclusion next week!]

363
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,860
[The power of the Archfiend Tapir
sends everyone back to dots.]

364
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:35,190
[See you next time.]
