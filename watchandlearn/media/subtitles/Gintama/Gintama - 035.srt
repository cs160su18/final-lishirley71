[Eromesu's House]

3
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:06,580
In the previous episode, Shinpachi saved a cat-eared girl from a drunk on the train.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,610
And so, this and that happened and he's been invited to the girl's house

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,290
which is an incredibly suspicious-looking place.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,960
Is this all right?

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,760
What exactly is "this and that"? Explain it in more detail.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,770
And include why we're following him.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,810
Umm... And so, that was probably how the story went.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,510
I've never heard such an irresponsible recap.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,740
And so, I feel kind of sluggish now.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,240
Don't say you're sluggish.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,120
Big Sis. It's impossible for someone apathetic like him. I'll do it.

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,350
And so, the cake was delicious.

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,350
You're talking about yourself.

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,540
You two think you can tack on "and so" onto anything, don't you?

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,760
And so, it was definitely delicious.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,170
Fine. I'll do it.

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,170
The land of the samurai. The time when our country was called that is long gone.

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,970
Hey, that's too far back!! How many episodes are we going to recap?!

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,970
And so, we explain things in order.

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,080
And so, you keep quiet.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,000
And so, no, you keep quiet.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,050
And so, anyway, we're going to the opening credits.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,030
[While on a date with Eromesu, for some reason, this happens at her house.]

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,100
[I don't care about the show being cancelled! Shinpachi will become a real man.]

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,110
["Love Doesn't Require a Manual (Continued)"]

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,340
What is this?

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,460
Your wife said that she didn't need a molester for a husband.

30
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,550
She said that you're probably too scared to slice your gut open,

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,260
so you should just blow your head off with this.

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,950
That woman doesn't understand anything.

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,190
I'm such a coward that I jump at the slightest noise.

34
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,080
I don't have the guts to molest anyone.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,690
That's pathetic, Pops.

36
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,800
Rather than shamelessly living in disgrace, you should die with honor like a samurai.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,930
Guys like you always commit suicide with charcoal fires whenever something happens.

38
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,700
It's not that impressive to be alive.

39
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,950
It's really impressive if you can embarrass yourself, suck it up and still live.

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,050
Why did you shoot him?

41
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,840
I couldn't bear to see Pops like that anymore.

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,560
Hijikata-san...

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,330
Why...are people always so...

44
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,290
Huh?

45
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,090
Why did you shoot him?

46
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,680
Why did you edit it to make it look as if I did?!

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Why are you sweating?! That's really pissing me off!!

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,170
Everyone, come here! Hijikata-san has gone mad.

49
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,950
I don't know what to do anymore! I just don't know!

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,440
No, no! It's not like that!! It wasn't me!! Cut that out!

51
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,200
He's going to kill me!

52
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,010
I can't find my pocketbook anywhere.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,440
Ever since the day of that molestation incident,

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,680
my police pocketbook and my wallet completely disappeared. What do you think?

55
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,060
And so, this and that happened, so we're following him. Is that fine?

56
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,480
Anyway, some other scene already came in. And so, that doesn't matter anymore.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,670
And so.

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,280
Hey!! What do you mean it doesn't matter?

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,940
You're the one who told me to do it properly! I did my best!!

60
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,960
Huh?

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,410
Huh? Eromesu-chan?

62
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,490
Where did she go?

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,820
What is this card?

64
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,920
What is this card?!

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,010
It's not funny!! Because of her, I was made out to be a molester!!

66
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,440
I was drinking at a bar by myself, when a woman approached me.

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,750
She was a good listener and she even listened to me about my daughter.

68
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,900
Oh, well, that doesn't matter. But anyway, I talked with her for a while.

69
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,120
We got along really well.

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,270
She told me that she knew a good place,

71
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,780
so I followed her and when we got on the train, she suddenly started making a fuss.

72
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,320
Stop!

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,220
Someone! Somebody, help me!

74
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,920
When I realized what had happened...

75
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,380
I'd become a molester. My police pocketbook and wallet

76
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,430
had disappeared, and in their place was this card.

77
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,310
I've taken your heart and your wallet.

78
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,930
Cat's Ear, the Phantom Thief.

79
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,930
[Note: Cat's Ear is a parody of the manga/anime series Cat's Eye]

80
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,470
I really fell for it. And at my age, too. But let me say this.

81
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,550
She didn't steal my heart.

82
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,450
My heart had already been stolen by my wife thirty years ago.

83
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,620
Wait...

84
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,160
You bastard!!

85
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,430
Wait...

86
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,190
I say!!

87
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,130
Who are you? Are you that boy's family?!

88
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,920
His older brother?

89
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,950
What are you doing bringing your stupid face here?

90
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,940
Did you follow us because you were worried about him?

91
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,330
You don't need to worry. I haven't done anything.

92
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,820
Your little brother's chastity is safe.

93
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,020
All I want is love.

94
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,170
Yes, I am Cat's Ear. The phantom thief who steals love.

95
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,820
Love is the most beautiful thing in the world.

96
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,640
But you cannot see love... Therefore...

97
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,050
As proof I have stolen someone's love, I borrow their wallet.

98
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,080
Shinpachi's wallet? What nonsense are you talking about?

99
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,460
You're just saying you're a thief.

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,020
Your younger brother was great.

101
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm surprised that such a pure boy exists in these times.

102
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,910
He completely fell for it.

103
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:42,150
He even wore those cat ears I gave to him just for fun. It was hilarious.

104
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,030
It made my heart beat like I was in love for the first time again.

105
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,530
This is why I can't stop doing this.

106
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,030
Hey. Have you stopped using your cute-girl act? I sorta liked it.

107
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,540
Men are really stupid, aren't they?

108
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,040
They can only judge things by what they see on the outside.

109
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,660
Oh! I revealed my true feelings. How silly of me.

110
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,910
Tee-hee!

111
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,410
Stop with the cutesy, cutesy, cutesy, cutesy.

112
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:15,090
[Otae says "buriburiburiburi," which roughly translates to "cutesy, cutesy, cutesy, cutesy." "Buriburi" is also the sound of someone defecating.]

113
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,980
Are you taking a crap or something?!

114
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,880
Well, are you?!

115
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,440
Women who can say "tee-hee" with a straight face are thoroughly unscrupulous.

116
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,210
Tee-hee!

117
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,490
Oh, it's true.

118
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,980
Shinpachi!!

119
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,050
Everyone, stop!!

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,830
They say that the losers in love are the ones who fall in love.

121
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:52,580
That's enough. I don't hate you. In fact, I'm grateful to you.

122
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,130
It was short, but...

123
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,490
I really had a fun time. It felt as if I had a girlfriend...

124
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,760
So...let me say one thing.

125
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,070
I'm just kidding, stupid!!

126
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,450
You were so cool!

127
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,870
Love, be it tragic or whatever, helps people mature.

128
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,200
I've become stronger since then.

129
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,560
My heart is no longer swayed by little things. I can stay strong-willed.

130
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,510
People's attractiveness doesn't come from superficial things like acting cute, or cat ears.

131
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,150
Rather, it comes...

132
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,000
From deep within their hearts.

133
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,930
Hey! Shut up! Be quiet! You're bothering the other passengers!

134
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,800
But President! Take a look at this! Otsu-chan's new single!!

135
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,310
She's gone for the cat-eared look on the jacket!!

136
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,040
Tha...

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,440
That's so cute!!

138
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:57,110
[Preview]

139
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,140
Pops, is it true that he's on the move?

140
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,780
You picked us up, so we're prepared to do anything for you!

141
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,120
The next episode: "You Can't Judge a Person by His Appearance, Either."

142
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,520
Right after these messages!!

143
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,080
[Right after these messages!!]

144
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:34,610
[The previous story went overtime... So this episode is airing 13 minutes late.]

145
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,040
[Kuriko and Shichibee on a date. What happens to this couple?!]

146
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,050
["You Can't Judge a Person by His Appearance, Either"]

147
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,860
I called you all here for one reason.

148
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,290
He's finally decided to make a move.

149
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,510
Pops, are you sure about that?

150
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,290
There's no mistake.

151
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,050
We have a spy planted in his vicinity.

152
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,530
The guy discovered the plant, but...

153
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,530
He finally couldn't take it anymore and has made a move.

154
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,810
I don't want to be a step behind anymore.

155
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,820
If our superiors have complaints about it, I'm prepared to slit my belly.

156
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,280
This is a battle to the death. I'm going to crush him and his plans.

157
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,840
All right, Pops. If you're that committed...then so are we.

158
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,790
I'm counting on you.

159
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,290
Toshi... Sogo... There's just one thing I want to check with you two.

160
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,700
What is it?

161
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,230
Who is "he"?

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,770

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,230
Oh, Kuriko.

165
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,550
Sorry, sorry I'm late. Did I keep you waiting?

166
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,000
No. I just got here, too. I didn't wait at all.

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,730
Oh, I see. Great. Well, the train was late...

168
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,530
That bastard, who is he kidding?

169
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,480
Kuriko waited over an hour for you.

170
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,800
That's one hour of my daughter's time. I took great care to raise her...

171
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,570
You're going to pay for that with your remaining life.

172

Hey, Toshi! Get over here and let me lean on you!

173
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,220
Hold on!! You mean this is the guy we're after?! Your daughter's boyfriend?

174
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,600
He's not her boyfriend! I'll never acknowledge a frivolous man like him!

175
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,330
Shut up! I don't acknowledge you as police chief!

176

Hijikata-san, I'll never acknowledge you as vice-chief of the Shinsengumi!!

177
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,700
You shut up!!

178
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,020
This is ridiculous! I took off work to come here.

179
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,660
And you're asking us to interrupt your daughter's date?

180
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,570
I can't do this. I'm leaving!

181
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,170
Hey, wait! I never asked you to break up her date.

182
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,080
I just want you to kill that guy.

183
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,680
That's even worse!

184
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,880
Do you think a jewelry-wearing joker like that is going to make Kuriko happy?

185
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,360
No, I want to acknowledge the guy that my daughter falls in love with.

186
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,570
I thought about it... I thought long and hard...

187
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,860
And I came to the conclusion that I have no choice, but to kill him.

188
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,540
That's thinking too much!!

Who are you calling Kondo?

What are you doing?

194
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,950
Why the 13?

195
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,040
It's a symbol of my persistence. This year, I've been dumped by Otae thirteen times.

196

Hey, Pops, I'll help, too. She needs a strong, silent type like me!

Kondo...

I've known Kuriko since she was a little girl... She's like a sister to me.

I can't give her away to a loser like that!

Hey, Kondo, how long until we catch up to him?

214

Oh, for god's sake, you're on a merry-go-round!!

You're just going to keep going around and around forever, moron!

I've never been to an amusement park, so I didn't know that.

I've been to adult amusement parks, though...

Don't be rash. In short, you want to break them up, right?

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,670
There are lots of better ways to do that.

What? You want to join us? You want to join the assassin alliance?

I just came to make sure you don't do anything crazy!!

223

Unlike you, I don't feel like denying this man's worth as a human being just by the way he looks.

224
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,950
He looks like a bad man no matter how you look at him.

225
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:25,260
He's full of holes. Aren't people born with enough holes already? Why make more?

226

I don't think body-piercing is a capital offense.

Hey, I look dangerous, but girls never liked me. What's with that?

Well, good or bad, love and romance is nothing but an illusion.

Your daughter has false illusions about that man.

You really are afraid, aren't you?

Absolutely.

253

Sogo is a super sadist who pressures and teases people as a hobby.

What's wrong? You don't look well.

Let's get off, if you, like totally, don't like it.

260

I'll kill you if you get off!!

Whoa! This is tougher than I'd expected...

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,630
How's it looking up there?

265
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,030

Hey, what's wrong with him? He's acting completely different.

269
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,900
He's getting all panicky.

270
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,380
Sure, I'm a sadist... but only because I'm so insecure inside!

271
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,570
H-H-H-Help me, Hijikata!! Damn it!

272
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,960
You idiot!

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,720
Ah... I was so scared...

274
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,530
Are you all right, Shichibee-sa...

275
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:16,730
Shichibee-sama... How come you're sitting so high in your seat?

276
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,980
This is bad. You'll probably be disgusted... But, I kind of crapped my pants.

277
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,070
Sorry, Shichibee. I don't have anything against you.

278
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,590
Thank goodness!!

279
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,600
Actually, I, like totally, did too.

280
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,360
I feel a lot less embarrassed knowing I'm like totally not the only one.

281

Really? Amazing!! We're a pair! It's a miracle!

282
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,560
We really are, like totally, connected by something.

283
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,490
What? Are we connected by our intestines?

284
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,100
Honestly...

285
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,870
Hey!! What's the meaning of this? They've gotten even closer!!

What the hell is wrong with your daughter?

287
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,730
What girl craps her pants? How are you raising her?

288
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,850
Oh no. They're going to the next attraction!

289

Toshi, like totally, don't tell anyone about this.

I can't believe this. How could she still want to be with him after that?!

295
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,070
My daughter is terrifying...

296
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,880
She really is terrifying.

297
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,280
I'll kill you if you tell anyone about this.

298
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,930
Pops, don't worry. Your daughter hasn't crapped her pants.

299
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,330
Look.

300
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,640
That guy changed his clothes, but your daughter is wearing the same clothes.

301
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,580
She's not walking around with it in her ass?

302
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,660
Of course not! Don't you find your daughter adorable?

303
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,430
Your daughter lied so he wouldn't feel bad.

304
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,540
What?

305
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,080
Toshi, are you saying that...

306
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,920
Kuriko-chan isn't disgusted at all by him taking a crap...

307
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,310
You were disgusted when I took a crap,

308
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,420
but Kuriko-chan accepts even the worst elements of his character.

309
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,890
Is that it?

310
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,030
Kondo-san, I'm disgusted, too...

311
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,250
Yeah...

312
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,130
She really loves that man...

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,840
Pops, look at that!

314
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,620
Oh no. They're headed to the Ferris wheel.

315
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,310
There's no mistake. They're planning on kissing.

316
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,520
How do you know?!

317
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,390
If it's the Ferris wheel, they're going to kiss. It was created for kissing.

318
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,370
K-Kiss?!

319
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,530
Really? My god... I never realized!

320
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,480
Kuriko-chan is in danger!

321
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,380
Let's go!!

322
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,210
Okay!

323
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,240
Hijikata-han. Hijikata-han.

324
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,790
[Note: In Kyoto, people use "han" instead of "san."]

325
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,790
Hijikata-han, you're so handsome and cool. You must be popular.

326
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
Not really.

327
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,810
No, that's not true.

328
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,770
Hijikata-han, Hijikata-han. Huh? What are you eating?

329
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,410
[Note: Ochazuke is rice with tea poured on it.]

330
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,410
It's the Ochazuke Hijikata Special. Want some?

331
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,930
I thought love was an illusion...

332
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,390
Kuriko, you really are amazing.

333
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,300
Most people would be disgusted if their boyfriend crapped his pants.

334
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,400
I thought it was all over.

335
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,770
I wouldn't, like totally, hate you for that.

336
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,020
Besides, you weren't disgusted when I crapped my pants, too.

337
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,470
What? That's because, well...

338
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,380
Well, what?

339
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,890
Well... That's because I...lo...

340
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,700
L?

341
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,240
Lo...

342
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,820
Lo...?

343
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,700
Wh-What's that?!

344
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,230
Assassin Samurai 13.

345
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,170
We're taking your life!

346
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,390
Huh?! That's so ridiculous...

347
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,430
Somebody, help-

348
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,340
What's that?!

349
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,080
Toshi?!

350
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,180
Toshi? Who's that?

351
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,540
I'm the warrior of love, Mayo 13!!

352
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,460
All who stand in the way of love...will perish!

353
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,140
Mayo 13?!

354
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,720
He's so cool...

355
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,500
Never let anyone come between you two.

356
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,090
Farewell...

357
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,700
Umm, I'll, like totally, dump poopy pants.

358
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,580
Would you, like totally, go out with me?!

359
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,230
I hate love...

360
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,050
The next episode: "People with Dark Pasts Can't Shut Up."

361
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,180

362
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,110

363
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:35,050

364
