00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,650
I passed the marriageable age a long time ago and am a so-called loser.

158
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,710
I was so focused on ensuring peace in the universe, that before I knew it,

159
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,030
I had become an old woman.

160
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,920
No matter how good a woman is,

161
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,580
if she doesn't give a man a chance, no one will pursue her.

162
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,450
That's my problem.

163
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,560
As I was protecting the peace of the universe, I never gave anyone a chance.

164
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,430
Because I was too busy protecting the peace in the universe!

165
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,800
If I give anyone a chance and get distracted, the monsters will win.

166
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,480
I've hardly ever been in love.

167
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,700
I've been deceived by bad guys...

168
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,530
I was even in a dangerous love affair with my boss, who had a wife and children.

169
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,130
I believed him when he said he would get a divorce someday, and I cried so many times.

170
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,890
One day, I had endured too much. I followed him in an attempt to destroy his family.

171
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,960
Duwa!

172
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,190
But then I saw him!

173
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,230
When he was with his family,

174
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,460
he had a warm smile that I'd never seen before. Then I thought...

175
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,660
My Vanadium Ray can't be used to destroy other people's happiness.

176
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,660
[Note: Vanadium Ray is a parody of Specium Ray from Ultraman.]

177
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,910
What kind of heroine are you? You're just a plain office lady!

178
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,220
I was really lonely. I just wanted someone to talk to.

179
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,940
That's why I was with that kind of guy.

180
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,320
Since then, I've hit bottom.

181
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,890
I hung around nightspots night after night, and I spent time with all kinds of monsters.

182
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,950
Why monsters?!

183
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,720
I learned a lot of skills, like using the Vanadium Ray.

184
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,820
What kind of skills?!

185
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,070
And... When I was tired, drained, full of despair

186
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,950
and had really fallen, he appeared.

187
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,440
Sir, I'm closing the bar.

188
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,060
Please wake up, sir. Your family will be worried.

189
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,810
He was just like me. No, he was the total opposite.

190
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,590
That's all right. There's no one at home, anyway.

191
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,910
Right... In order to conquer the universe,

192
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,060
he devoted himself to conquering space and passed the marriageable age.

193
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,070
I felt he would understand me.

194
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,840
I felt he would accept me.

195
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,570
Right... He...

196
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,010
Monster Shogun Colonel Cherry!

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,040
Huh?

198
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,870
That guy?

199
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,980
What?!

200
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,130
Are you going to give Valentine's Day chocolates to Monster Shogun, the enemy?!

201
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,230
No, no, no, no! That's ridiculous! Ridiculous!

202
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,910
Even if you've passed the marriageable age, you're being ridiculous!

203
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,780
In order to lure their general out, I've defeated numerous monsters.

204
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,650
I thought you were fighting for the sake of protecting peace in the universe!

205
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,080
Finally the time has come. Now is my only chance to declare my love.

206
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,660
Hey! This woman is only thinking about marriageable age issues!

207
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,840
Calm down, Shinpachi. The opponent is the enemy's general.

208
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,140
If her love declaration succeeds, then they'll reconcile and the universe will be at peace.

209
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,830
That kind of universal peace is just disgusting!

210
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,180
You, Spacewoman, have finally come!

211
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,190
Causing couples who are excited about Valentine's Day to break up...

212
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,870
Causing the birthrate decline...

213
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,170
Causing the population decline...

214
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,240
And on and on... And my plans for taking over the universe...

215
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,280
You dare disturb me?

216
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,490
Huh? Even without things like that, the universe can still be peaceful, right?

217
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,520
Colonel Cherry. You're wrong. Today... Um... Well...

218
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,710
What's the matter?! He's the enemy!

219
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,230
Why are you suddenly turning your back on him?!

220
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,830
To tell you the truth... I've never made any love declarations before.

221
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,380
Don't worry. Supe-chan, you're the heroine of the universe.

222
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,070
You must've overcome all your hardships.

223
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,080
Yes, I always rushed to people when they requested help.

224
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,950
I always gave my body and heart to men whenever they wanted.

225
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,080
I was a convenient woman.

226
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,450
That's me.

227
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,590
Hey! You're talking about a totally different subject!

228
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,460
A person like me... Now...

229
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,460
It's too late...

230
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,770
For me to bring out courage like that of a high school girl...

231
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,730
...no way.

232
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,450
I don't know what you're doing, but it's foolish to turn your back on your enemy.

233
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,470
Whoa! This is bad! Woman-san!

234
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,910
Take this!

235
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,320
Wait!

236
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,210
Duwa!

237
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,220
Deden...

238
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,520
Hmm... A rookie?

239
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,050
He's on our side, right?! He must be here to save us!

240
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,890
Ouch!

241
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,480
Spacewoman...

242
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,700
Hiroshi-san...

243
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,430
Eh...

244
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,440
I've separated with my wife!
Come back to me!

245
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,720
I love only you!

246
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,180
What?!

247
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,900
You're the boss she was talking about?!

248
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,790
We thought you came here to defeat the monster!

249
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,660
It's too late now! I can't believe what you just said!

250
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,660
Please! Let's start over again! And let's open a ranch in Argentina!

251
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,830
[Note: Spoof of the musical movie "Down Argentine Way."]

252
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,830
Stop it!

253
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,560
Duwa...

254
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,430
Duwa...

255
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,180
...You really hate me...

256
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,240
But, I can't back out now...

257
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,980
I'll make you come with me, even by force... Duwa!

258
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,800
What kind of atmosphere is this? It looks like another opponent has arrived.

259
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,420
I don't get it. What kind of lovers' spat is this?

260
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,970
I don't hate him... Rather... My heart is trembling...

261
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,690
Why is it so weak...my heart?!

262
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,700
Supe-chan, don't believe him!

263
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,170
He can't commit to his own family!
That means he can't commit to you, either!

264
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,360
Hello, Mom!

265
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,440
Sorry about earlier... Yes... I'm busy now, but I wanted to call you...

266
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,690
Listen, Mom has something to tell you. Your daddy's health...

267
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,200
...He won't last two years.

268
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,910
So...at the very least. I hope he can see his grandchild.

269
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,440
Mom...

270
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,860
Akiko...

271
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,050
Dad!

272
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,440
Even if your mom says something like that...don't worry about it.

273
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,410
But...my last wish is to see...my daughter's...

274
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,910
...happiness as a woman...

275
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,420
Dad...

276
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,540
I hope you'll be able to be happy...Akiko.

277
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,940
Thinking about my dad,

278
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,380
I'd better go with Hiroshi-san, who has some economic clout...

279
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,370
But...my heart now...

280
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,080
I don't know what I should do...

281
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,880
I've been fighting to protect peace in the universe.

282
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,420
That was for the sake of people's happiness... But...

283
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,650
Duwa!

284
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,420
...I don't know how to fight for my own happiness.

285
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,970
What are you saying?!

286
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,060
Regardless of whether they're a hero or heroine,

287
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,020
they don't know how to find happiness.

288
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,640
[Note: Goku is the main character of Dragon Ball.]

289
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,430
Even with Goku getting married and having kids...

290
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,640
Perhaps even the author, as well as Goku himself, didn't expect that.

291
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,900
You've been fighting for other people for a long time, right?

292
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,310
Then it's okay if you are just a bit selfish.
There's nothing wrong with that, I guess.

293
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,200
Hiroshi-san.

294
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,350
I'm really happy to hear your declaration of love.

295
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,770
Spacewoman...

296
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,600
However...!

297
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,600
Duwa?!

298
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,580
You're in the past! You're an enemy to my future happiness!

299
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,660
What are you talking about, Spacewo-?

300
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,620
Derya!

301
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,480
Good-bye, Hiroshi-san! Good-bye to the old me!

302
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,500
Now, I can start being the new me.

303
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,510
That was way too harsh on your Boss!

304
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,770
That's you being just "a bit selfish"?! That was way overboard!

305
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,430
Duwa!

306
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,280
I'm sorry for saying such a bold thing!

307
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,570
Fight among yourselves, Spacewoman!

308
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,030
I wouldn't know what to do if you two conspired against me!

309
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,440
But I'm saved!

310
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,290
I'm really saved!

311
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,450
Why are you saying that with such confidence?!

312
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,770
Co-Colonel Cherry... A-Actually...

313
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,870
What? You look like you've frozen up!

314
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,400
Am I too frightening an opponent for you?

315
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,410
Huh? What's this?!

316
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,360
Hey, what's going on?! Come on!

317
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,080
Why won't you talk to me?!

318
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,570
If you don't fight me...

319
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,860
...I'll start attacking!

320
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,910
Take this!

321
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,260
Please...be gentle.

322
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,920
H-Hey, w-wait! W-What is this?!

323
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,510
What's wrong with you?!

324
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,250
You've been acting so disgusting!

325
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,120
What are you doing?! You're on our side, right?!

326
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,510
A guy like that...hurry up and beat him!

327
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,400
Huh? That girl has been blushing for a while.

328
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,020
What?! Could it be that she likes him?

329
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,750
Hey, shut up, girls!

330
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,410
There's no way!

331
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,400
Stop joking! Shut up!

332
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,740
Tsk.

333
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,510
Hey, Cherry! Cherry!

334
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,270
Come with us to the back of the school.

335
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,840
Spacewoman-san has something to say to you.

336
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,980
Wh-What?! I'm not going.

337
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,820
I have to go to club activities and my friends are waiting for me.

338
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,340
Hey, Cherry, how many chocolates did you get today?

339
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,160
It's none of your business! What?! I didn't get anything like that!

340
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,810
Well!

341
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,740
Ah! Hey!

342
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,580
That's great! Maybe you'll get one today!

343
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,130
Wait...

344
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,430
Stop it!

345
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,290
Cherry-kun.

346
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Oh, it's you, Pachie.

347
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,660
Hey, Cherry-kun, this year your Valentine's Day will be...

348
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,900
...the best Valentine's Day ever!

349
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,260
Shut up, ugly girl.

350
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,630
Gee.

351
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,400
Damn it. Where did they go?

352
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,450
S-Spacewoman...

353
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,550
Well... Ah...

354
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,730
...What? You go first.

355
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,390
No... Cherry-kun, you go first...

356
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,630
Come on! Go for it!

357
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,610
Spacewoman-san, tell him!

358
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,390
Please use my chocolate!

359
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,870
Mine, too!

360
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,880
And mine!

361
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,480
Mine, too!

362
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,800
Me, too!

363
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,880
This, too!

364
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Me, too!

365
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,380
Good luck, Spacewoman!

366
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,770
Wh-What are you girls doing?!

367
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,920
Cherry-kun...

368
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,360
Will you accept my heart?

369
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,510
...Spacewoman...

370
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,100
Cherry-kun...

371
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,660
It's like...

372
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,470
...embarrassing.

373
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,210
You doing something like this to me...

374
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,720
Deyaa!

375
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:43,290
Ah, Mom? Yes. Today, I...protected the peace...of the universe.

[Preview]

377
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,940
Kill me! Kill me!

378
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,440
Even if I live, I'm just destined to dance a bloody rondo all my life.

379
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,440
[Note: Rondo is music used for a circular dance.]

380
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Please finish me now!
