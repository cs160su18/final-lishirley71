00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,140
Keep the room well-lit and watch from a distance, okay?

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,020
Huh?

4
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,370
[Gintoki was swallowed up by the alien that grew to a humongous size.]

5
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:42,080
[What is it that Umibozu saw as he searched for Kagura?]

6
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,540
Kagura!

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,090
["You Know What Happens if You Pee on a Worm"]

8
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,320
Kagura!

9
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,930
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

10
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,210
You bastards... Did you just sit there and watch?

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,230
After my daughter saved your lives... as she grew weaker and weaker...

12
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,070
Did you just sit there and watch her die?

13
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,810
W-W-Wait! In this situation, we couldn't call a doctor, even if we tried... Right, Jii?

14
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,020
Don't pass it to me! I don't know what happened! I don't know anything!

15
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,920
I'm still in shock!

16
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,080
Damn you!

17
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,760
Pappy, don't. Not after I saved their lives.

18
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,880
Kagura! It's okay now!

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,260
Daddy's going to take care of you! You don't have to worry!

20
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,950
I've changed, haven't I?

21
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:42,270
My strength is not just for hurting people. I can protect people too, now, uh-huh.

22
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,570
Don't talk anymore!

23
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,170
When I did...I made so many friends.

24
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm not alone anymore.

25
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,220
The Yato fought, and fought, and destroyed themselves.

26
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,580
The Yato fought, and fought, and found themselves all alone.

27
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,160
Pappy, big brother...everyone...

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,130
The ones we have to fight are ourselves. If we don't...everyone will be all alone.

29
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,650
Pappy...

30
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,310
Kagura!

31
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,160
Kagura!

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,700
Gin...chan.

33
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,030
Gin-cha...

34
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,860
Kagura!

35
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,030
Gin-chan...

36
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,560
Damn earthworm monster! Let her go!

37
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,930
Or I'll...I'll piss on you!

38
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,560
Don't do that!

39
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,530
Your you-know-what will swell up!

40
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,110
Didn't your mother...ever teach you that?

41
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,390
Aren't you a bit late to be showing up now, young man?

42
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,770
What brings you here?

43
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,400
I love spectacles. Don't you? Fires, fights and aliens are what Edo is famous for.

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,130
All I know is...you're a pain in the ass!! Get lost.

45
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,680
Shut up! At least I still have two arms!

46
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,650
My one arm is worth three of yours!

47
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,100
Oh yeah?! Well, three of mine are worth six of yours!!

48
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,630
You should go home! Go to a hospital and get a new brain to go with your new arm!!

49
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,410
If I get a new brain, it'll be to bring one back for you!!

50
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,250
And I'm not going to a hospital for just an arm! My left arm was a prosthetic anyways.

51
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,890
Have them make you a prosthetic head while they're at it, you barcode-headed geezer!

52
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,460
Stop it! Your reign of terror ends here!

53
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,960
Don't let them get into the streets of Edo!

54
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,030
Vice-chief! The terminal is coming apart!

55
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,030
They're not going to blame us, are they?

56
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,750
Who cares? We'll just say that the monster destroyed it.

57
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,340
Viewers, did you hear that? Despite specific orders from the government, the Shinsen-

58
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,480
Look at that!

59
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,890
The alien is retreating.

60
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,670
We did it! We've won!

61
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,320
No, we haven't.

62
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,330
Wh-What's it doing?! The alien is wrapping around the ship!

63
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,330
What's happening? What is going on over there?

64
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,940
Look! There's someone...!

65
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,830
Right in the middle of the monster!

66
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,870
Amid a maelstrom of jaws, someone is yelling! They're shouting something!

67
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,500
Umibozu? That's...Umibozu! And that guy!

68
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,610
Out of my way!

69
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,940
Or we're gonna piss on you!

70
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,770
That's Umibozu? He's like a monster.

71
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,120
No, no... Boss is keeping up with his pace!

72
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,110
With them there, we can't just carelessly shoot. They'll be caught in the crossfire...

73
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,860
Those are...Bakufu warships.

74
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,920
It's Pops! Old man Matsudaira is here!

75
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,060
The god of destruction! Katakuriko Matsudaira!

76
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,640
We've got trouble! After that old guy is done, only ashes will be left!

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,250
He'll take out the entire terminal!

78
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,610
Looks like they've finally shown up for their photo op!

79
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,190
We've just about taken care of things here.

80
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,960
I've got to hand it to you, punk, for an Earthling, you're pretty good.

81
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,660
That means a whole lot of nothing coming from you, monster.

82
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,060
I'm amazed you fought this far with just one arm.

83
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,830
You only have one arm yourself.

84
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,980
For your own sake, go home. You'll die if you stay any longer.

85
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,330
I'd love to, but I don't see any exits around here.

86
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,280
I can't figure you out.

87
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,470
You pushed Kagura away, so what are you doing here? Why do all this?

88
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,350
I'd like to know the same thing. Why did I come here?

89
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,760
Are you...

90
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,030
Relax. I'm not planning on taking that loudmouth brat back with me.

91
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,350
And of course, I'm not planning on dying either. It's just that...

92
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,090
I'm not going to let her die.

93
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,370
Interesting. You're an interesting fellow.

94
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,100
I think I understand why Kagura likes you.

95
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,670
But what can you do with only one arm?

96
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,200
You only have one arm, too.

97
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,610
No, no...

98
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,270
Together, we've got two!

99
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,400
It makes me sick to do it, but I'll help you until we rescue Kagura!

100
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
Count your blessings, Pops.

101
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,840
I see... Thanks!

102
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,760
What's that? The ship's keel, it's...

103
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,360
H-Hey, it's...

104
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,430
Wh-What is that?!

105
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,930
The nucleus. The core of the parasitic alien.

106
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,550
It's the first one I've seen that's this huge.

107
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,110
It's absorbed an excessive amount of the terminal's energy and finally blew right through the ship.

108
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,180
If we smash that, we'll be able to stop this thing.

109
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,460
Ka...

110
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,710
Kagura!

111
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,640
It swallowed her up!

112
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,130
We've got a problem... We can't kill it now!

113
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,520
If we do, Kagura will die.

114
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,370
Attention!

115
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,860
All civilians in the terminal vicinity! Leave the area immediately.

116
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,910
We are about to open fire on the alien! Vacate the area immediately.

117
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,030
Wha?!

118
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,910
What?!

119
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,280
Pops, wait! A civilian child has been sucked into the alien.

120
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,080
Kondo... Are you weighing the life of a single civilian with all of Edo?

121
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,530
Our mission is to save as many lives as we can.

122
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,760
Would you risk your entire mission for just one of those lives? Don't be a wussy.

123
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,240
But, Pops!

124
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,770
Chief, the alien!

125
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,840
Damn! It's on the move again.

126
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,750
You see what I mean? That's what happens when you don't listen to me.

127
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,850
But Pops knows best, doesn't he? I'm made up of 80 percent correctness.

128
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,700
You two go on home! You're in our way!

129
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,040
Go.

130
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,650
This place will soon be a sea of flames.

131
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,660
You...aren't thinking of doing this alone, are you?!

132
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:48,250
I'm a real loser. I'm called the fiercest there is, but I can't protect anything.

133
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,600
Not my family... Not my only daughter... Nothing.

134
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,570
The Yato fought, and fought, and found themselves all alone.

135
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:03,010
The ones we have to fight are ourselves. If we don't...everyone will be all alone.

136
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,170
This the price I have to pay for running away for so long.

137
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,320
I'm sorry, Kagura...

138
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,080
At least let me die together with you.

139
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,630
This is why daughters get mad at their fathers.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,130
Look dad, can't you even trust your own kid?

141
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,040
Do you think she's so weak that a little thing like this'll kill her?

142
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,590
Five minutes. Just delay 'em five minutes for me.

143
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,010
I'm not asking you to believe in me. But...

144
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,620
At least believe in Kagura.

145
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,310
What're you planning to do?!

146
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,670
What a crazy thing to do...

147
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,090
What're we gonna do, Kondo-san?!

148
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,970
Ready the Matsu-Blaster for firing!

149
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,970
Commissioner

150
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,150
Never mind. Just fire.

151
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,950
No, it's not that...

152
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,200
Look at that...

153
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,240
They didn't leave...

154
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,480
In fact, there are more of them.

155
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
What?

156
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,560
You dumb-asses! Can't you see this old guy?

157
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,520
If you shoot now, this idiot prince will be blasted to death!

158
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,680
You'll have an international incident on your hands!

159
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,360
Just wait five minutes, that's all we ask!

160
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,790
Sure, what difference could five minutes make?

161
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,430
Go make yourself some instant ramen while you wait!

162
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,430
Y-You people...

163
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,350
That girl saved us.

164
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,210
They won't shoot, will they? We'll be all right, won't we?

165
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,390
That darn wavy head! If he was intent on coming, he should've said so at the start.

166
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,780
Well, I knew he was going to come, anyway.

167
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,580
I've changed, haven't I?

168
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,060
I can protect people too, now, uh-huh.

169
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,340
When I did...I made so many friends.

170
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,950
I'm not alone anymore.

171
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,150
Kagura...

172
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,310
Wake up...

173
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,910
Gi...Gin-chan...

174
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,440
Look, I'm gonna eat all your pickled seaweed!

175
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,450
Commissioner... He's the real thing! The real Prince Hata.

176
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,350
What's he doing there?

177
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,180
Oh, is this it? Is this the Matsu-blaster firing button?

178
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,460
Uh...yeah... But we have to quickly rescue him.

179
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,570
Huh? Did you just push that? You're kidding! You just pushed it?!

180
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,840
I have to be at my daughter's birthday party at five.

181
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,120
What?! We have to stop it!

182
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,210
It can't be stopped!

183
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,030
Does it look like they're starting to fire?

184
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,120
You're kidding, right? I am a prince, you know!

185
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,910
We're in trouble. We gotta get outta here!

186
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,930
That's my pickled seaweed!

187
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,600
Kagura!

188
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,720
You did it?!

189
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,020
Man, that kid sure gets vicious about food.

190
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,030
Did her parents starve her or something?

191
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,440
You know what I wonder? Did your parents cut out your brain?

192
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,480
Maybe I never had any parents.

193
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,070
That I can believe!

194
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,070
Now then, shall we?

195
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,940
Let's finish the job.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,910
Let's do it, dad.

197
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,540
Who're you calling "dad"?!

198
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,750
Look! The alien is...

199
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,260
Pops! Stop the attack! There's no need to shoot anymore!

200
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,120
Stop? Don't be silly!

201
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,050
Kuriko is still seventeen.

202
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,310
She said she wants to celebrate her party alone with her boyfriend.

203
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,230
But she plans on staying out all night. I absolutely won't allow that.

204
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,800
I'll do everything I can to stop it. I'll even dance the Lambada on top of her cake.

205
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,770
Not stop as in "stop over"! Can't you think of anything else except your daughter?!

206
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,250
Quiet! I can't stop it now, anyway.

207
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,420
Hurry up and get out of there! I won't be responsible for whatever happens to you!!

208
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,860
Huh? Run? Where are we supposed to go?

209
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,650
My glasses... My glasses... My glasses...

210
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,700
Down's no good. Go up. Up!

211
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,560
Give me back my pickled seaweed!

212
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,050
Kagura, pull yourself together.

213
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,430
Stop it, he's bleeding.

214
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,090
She's not fully conscious. She broke through the nucleus in this condition?

215
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,570
This man's voice reached into the depths of Kagura's subconscious.

216
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,440
Ah! Pickled seaweed.

217
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,710
What're you doing?! Pappy's precious hair!

218
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,210
Hey! What're you eating?!

219
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,090
Spit it out! You'll go bald! You'll go bald if you eat that!

220
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,460
Huh? What's that sound?

221
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,620
Destruction...confirmed.

222
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,470
My...god...

223
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,720
Those guys must be...

224
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,080
How is that possible?

225
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,300
With just an umbrella...

226
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,670
he blocked the blast.

227
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,970
B-Bozu-san!

228
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,930
Looks like I got a bit fired up myself!

229
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,570
Your hair is on fire, but...

230
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,710
Imagine me dying...to save somebody else!

231
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,820
H-Hey!

232
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,910
Bozu-san!

233
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,260
Baldy! Hey, Baldy!

234
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,570
Bal...I mean... Bozu-san.

235
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,690
Baldy...

236
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,750
Baldy, but only on the right!

237
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,940
At one point, I really thought it was the end,

238
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,180
but I prevailed with my exceptional kara-tay skills.

239
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,910
What're we going to do with this mountain of dead alien flesh?

240
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,910
The terminal will be out of service for a while, as well.

241
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,530
No telling what the higher-ups are going to say. That old man, for chrissake...

242
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,160
But that monster was every bit what the rumors said he was.

243
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,080
I mean Umibozu... Umibozu.

244
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,620
To tell the truth, I was way more scared of him than the alien.

245
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,090
Really? He didn't look like a monster to me.

246
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,280
He just looked like any father, struggling to protect his daughter.

247
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,630
A father just like any other around here, having trouble with his daughter.

248
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,930
Did you find what you were looking for, Umibozu-dono?

249
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,260
How's Kagura?

250
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,760
She's being treated by the rescue team. Her injury was pretty serious.

251
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,850
Shouldn't you get treated, too?

252
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,020
I told you, my left arm was a prosthetic from the start.

253
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,690
I just need to get a new one.

254
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,250
Not your arm...your brain.

255
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,590
What do you mean?

256
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,910
You know what I mean.

257
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,510
Oh, in that case, I'll kill you.

258
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,000
Now, I'm missing not only my arm, but my hair, too...

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,770
It'll grow back in time.

260
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,290
Arms don't grow back.

261
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,080
Not your arm... Your hair.

262
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:26,520
I see... My hair, eh? All you talk about is my hair. I'll kill you.

263
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,630
But anyway, both of them serve as a lesson to me.

264
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,260
A lesson?

265
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,130
I lost it to my own kid, you see.

266
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,160
Not Kagura. I have an older kid, too.

267
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
That one's a real bad egg.

268
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,340
No...not bad, let's just say he faithfully carried the blood of the Yato Clan.

269
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,100
He's a kid who's the personification of the fighting spirit.

270
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,170
A long time ago, the Yato clan had a terrible custom called "Parent Killing."

271
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,470
It was a savage practice where a person's worth was determined by surpassing their parents.

272
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:06,900
These days, that practice has all but disappeared, but he tried to revive it.

273
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,430
He tried to take the head of the legendary Umibozu.

274
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,470
Surprised? That's what we Yato are like.

275
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,690
When it happened, I suddenly realized...

276
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,010
Squaring off with my own son, who was going for my neck...

277
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,710
That I wasn't trying to stop him... I was trying to kill him.

278
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,870
If Kagura hadn't stopped me, I would have murdered him for sure.

279
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,270
Even now, I can't forget the fear I saw in her eyes.

280
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,600
After that, I couldn't go near my home.

281
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,540
I was afraid that Kagura would one day seek my life as well.

282
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,250
I was overwhelmed with the fear, that if she did,

283
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,710
I would not be able to suppress the beast inside of me.

284
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,130
I didn't have the courage to change, or to trust myself,

285
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,650
so I ran away, leaving young Kagura and her dying mother behind.

286
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,530
I was afraid of destroying my family, but in the end, not a trace of my family remains.

287
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:15,220
I came all this way, because I didn't want Kagura to go through the same thing I did.

288
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,870
But I almost repeated the same mistake.

289
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,980
When you told me, it hit me.

290
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,540
It was Kagura who stopped me then, and it was always Kagura who supported me.

291
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,770
That's how she is, and yet I couldn't even trust her one bit.

292
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:38,420
I thought I saw myself in Kagura. But Kagura and I are different. She's...

293
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,930
She's a lot stronger than I am.

294
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,080
But I-I'm a total failure as a father.

295
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,650
No...maybe I'm the only one who thinks I'm a father.

296
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,910
Maybe she doesn't even think of me as her father.

297
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,310
A letter...

298
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,830
She always wrote them in secret.

299
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,120
Since you had no permanent address, they were always sent back to my place.

300
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,370
I secretly kept all of them in my closet hoping if I ever got the chance to hand them to you...

301
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,190
This is the only one I have right now.

302
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,990
Oh, and don't worry, I'd never do anything so crass as to read them.

303
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,850
I figured you're not the type...to read this and go nuts about it.

304
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
See you later.

305
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,550
Hey!

306
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,140
I don't know all the details, but...

307
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,590
If you have a parent who cares about you, what more do you need?

308
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,580
I wish I had one... A family like yours.

309
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,970
Gin...

310
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,570
Ironic, ain't it?

311
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,590
How the people who don't have things...usually understand them better than the ones who do.

312
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,070
So...cherish her... Okay?

313
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,620
Let me make this clear. I'm staying at the Odd Jobs for good.

314
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,730
You can think of me as family.

315
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,260
Didn't he say he was quitting?

316
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,110
Cherish her, huh?

317
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,660
Hey! Are you listening, Kagura?

318
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,390
That's the deal. From now on... Daddy will cherish you.

319
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,940
So be happy, okay?

320
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,890
Pappy! Why...

321
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,080
Wait, Pappy!

322
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,460
Dear Father,

323
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,060
I haven't seen you in a while. Are you well? I'm doing fine.

324
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,420
Right now, I am living in a city called Edo with some strange people called samurai.

325
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,600
They are truly strange creatures.

326
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,340
Even though they're usually all weak, hopeless and pathetic,

327
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:13,380
when it really counts, they call on some idea called "Bushido" and become these tough, noble warriors.

328
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,970
And they have something in common with the Yato. They're all fighting against themselves.

329
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,500
I think if I stay here I can change.

330
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,420
I think I can become a person who doesn't give in to herself.

331
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,500
If I do change, Pappy... I want you to take me with you on your travels.

332
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:40,760
My dream is to travel through the universe with you...and become the top alien hunter in the galaxy.

333
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,100
Love, Kagura.

334
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,340
I'll be waiting, Kagura.
