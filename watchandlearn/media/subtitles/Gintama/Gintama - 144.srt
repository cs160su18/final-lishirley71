00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,770
I'm still fighting.

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,470
What are you doing, idiot?

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,110
Get going already.

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,180
Take your mom and get outta here!

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,890
No...!

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,250
No way!

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,940
You said so!

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,950
That there were bonds stronger than family,

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,220
even when people aren't related by blood?

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,730
Everybody...  Gin-san...

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,230
You're all like family to me!

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,840
The one and only people that taught me what's important!

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,850
And you're telling me to abandon you here?!

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,280
Let you die in this place?!

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,400
Hearing you say that is more than enough...

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,120
Get going.

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,560
Don't turn me into a loser again.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,350
Gin-san...

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,940
Gi...

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,790
Gin...!

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,010
Gin-san!!

23
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,970
["Don't Trust Bedtime Stories"]

24
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,470
How pathetic.

25
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,660
Your nation, your master, losing everything you had to protect,

26
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,920
and you die protecting for someone.

27
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,760
You want to find a purpose for your sword so badly?

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,200
You can't protect anything with a sword like that.

29
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,020
Not even your own life.

30
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,220
G-Gin-san...

31
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,850
Gin-san!!

32
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,230
Do you have time to be crying?

33
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,150
A man made a request with his dying breath.

34
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,940
Shouldn't you do as he asked?

35
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,470
Get going already.

36
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,120
Take your mom and run away!

37
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,520
Don't turn me into a loser again.

38
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,350
A useless effort...

39
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,930
Mom!

40
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,930
Let's run away!

41
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,800
Run away from this place with me right now!!

42
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,970
Hurry, Mom!!

43
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,180
Mo...

44
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,130
...Mom?

45
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,200
Why aren't you doing anything...

46
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,330
Why won't you try to move?

47
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,170
I can't escape.

48
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,590
I can't escape from this place...

49
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,940
What...are you saying?

50
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,350
What are you saying at a time like this, Mom?!

51
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,390
I'm sorry, Seita.

52
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,150
You run away by yourself.

53
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,550
Mo...!

54
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,470
S-Stop, Seita!!

55
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,000
Wh-What is this...

56
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,700
I told you.

57
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,480
The woman of Yoshiwara...
Hinowa belongs to me.

58
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,350
She cannot escape anywhere.

59
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,550
She can try to take off to the surface, but there is no sky here.

60
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,020
Let alone wings for her to fly with.

61
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,060
They were torn into pieces long ago.

62
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,720
M-Mom...

63
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,420
That woman can no longer stand on her own legs,

64
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,430
much less walk on her own!

65
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,540
She can no longer go anywhere.

66
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,830
She cannot escape from me.

67
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,180
You even took her legs to chain her down, huh?

68
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,270
How could you...

69
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,100
What did Mom ever do?

70
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,530
Why does Mom have to suffer all alone like this?

71
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,050
It's okay.

72
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,610
That's enough.

73
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,790
You've already saved me, Seita.

74
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,860
I was able to see you.

75
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,850
That's enough for me.

76
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,450
You called me your mom.

77
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,520
That's enough to keep me going...
no matter where I am.

78
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,490
So don't mind me and get going.

79
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,230
Please live, Seita.

80
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,800
You're my...

81
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,060
Yoshiwara's... hope.

82
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,060
To us women of Yoshiwara,

83
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,810
unable to live as women or mothers,

84
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,420
you are our only child.

85
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,860
As long as you're alive, we can survive in any hell.

86
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,110
We can bear any hardship.

87
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,180
So live in freedom for our sake with all you've got.

88
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,610
Get going already.

89
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,330
Just like eight years ago.

90
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,070
Entrusting the child with your hopes and letting him escape to the surface.

91
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,780
It's exactly the same.

92
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,400
The only difference is, this time the child cannot escape.

93
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,930
Time to stop playing mother, Hinowa.

94
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,420
A filthy prostitute could never become a mother.

95
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,910
You can never be a mother.

96
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,220
I'll prove it to you.

97
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,940
By killing...

98
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,770
that child.

99
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,010
Man... Never expected you to be into her this much.

100
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,190
I find it hard to believe you were my master.

101
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,920
Looks like you haven't made any progress in the past eight years.

102
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,950
Ruining a prostitute and taking away her value as an item.

103
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,730
Yet you still keep her at your side.

104
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,540
Boss, it appears you need her not as an item,

105
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,500
...but as a woman.

106
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,970
I need her?

107
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,460
What nonsense.

108
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,260
You've got it backwards.

109
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,770
Money, authority, women, everything I wanted,

110
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,970
I obtained with my power.

111
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,490
But there is one thing even I cannot obtain.

112
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,690
Something not even the King of the Night could bring down...

113
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,000
I was forced to run deep into this underground world.

114
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,120
Yet even in this eternal darkness,
it still exists without change.

115
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,090
My... No, the Yato's most dreaded existence,

116
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,470
our one and only predator!

117
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,940
Yes, the sun!

118
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,350
No matter how much she suffers,
those eyes never lose their light.

119
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,820
No matter how low she sinks down to, her spirit wouldn't break.

120
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,830
Her noble sight is just like the dreaded sun.

121
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,060
My thirst won't quench.

122
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,120
No matter how much I drank...

123
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,030
No matter how many women I took to my bed...

124
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,020
No matter how much blood I spilled...

125
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,850
As long as the sun was shining,
my thirst shall never quench.

126
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,380
I had to drag the sun down to earth.

127
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,520
Not through death...

128
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,500
I would drag that noble spirit down,

129
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,130
and force Hinowa to yield to me!

130
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,950
Pressure her until she broke down into tears and begged me for mercy!

131
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,650
I would obtain the sun!

132
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,390
There is no other way to quench my soul's thirst.

133
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,600
I would break you down and make you mine!

134
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
Come down to me!

135
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,030
You belong to me!!

136
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,290
Bring it down if you can.

137
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,640
It doesn't matter how many times you try to bring the sun down.

138
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,100
As long as the sky is clear, the sun will rise again and again!

139
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,690
It doesn't matter how many times you try to cloud the sky,

140
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,100
I'll clear it up again and again!

141
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,090
It doesn't matter how many times you try to cloud my Mom's face,

142
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,900
I'll make her smile again and again!

143
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,100
Child! You...

144
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,260
Seita, put me down!!

145
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,390
You think you can escape from Yoshiwara while carrying an adult?!

146
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,770
You can scream all you want.

147
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,550
I was probably screaming like that when I was in Mom's belly.

148
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,820
When you're a baby, your parents would carry you.

149
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,780
Once you're grown up, it's your turn to carry the aging parents.

150
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,240
That's what a parent and their child are, right?

151
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,340
Let me carry you, too.

152
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,590
Don't just have yourself carry the entire burden.

153
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,880
A son is supposed to carry a mom or two.

154
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,820
This isn't heavy at all.

155
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,460
I've never carried anything before.

156
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,310
So this is just fine.

157
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,140
This weight makes me happier more than anything.

158
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,180
S-Seita...

159
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,660
That sounds quite encouraging.

160
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,910
This is...?!

161
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,380
In that case, can you carry everybody here?

162
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,130
Your mothers... All 49 of them.

163
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,900
We're happy to have such a nice son.

164
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,300
Tsukuyo!

165
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,980
Fools!

166
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,120
What is this?

167
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,950
A rebellion?!

168
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,580
You're rebelling against me,
the King of the Night?!

169
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,480
Don't blame us.

170
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,740
We were merely fooled by a rude guest.

171
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,990
Bluffing us with a bedtime story about launching a sun into Yoshiwara.

172
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,510
Everyone here was tricked by his words.

173
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,800
See? It's the guy lying over there.

174
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,130
We come here believing in him and this is what we get.

175
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,750
What a joke this is.

176
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,010
After all that big talk you made, look at you!

177
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,430
Where's that sun you promised?

178
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,190
I was a fool for expecting anything from you.

179
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,660
You...

180
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,200
Big stinkin' liar!!

181
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
...I didn't lie.

182
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,310
The sun did arise.

183
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,030
All around the place!

184
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,720
The sun did rise.

185
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
All around the place!

186
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,270
Y-You...

187
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,100
It's so bright I can't even sleep.

188
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,140
Gi...

189
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,620
Gin...!

190
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,720
Gin-san!!

191
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,880
Oh wow, he's up.

192
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,850
So he's still gonna fight.

193
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,150
Guess I made a mistake.

194
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,940
I thought you were dead.

195
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,580
But it doesn't look like you'll be much help.

196
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,560
You can barely stand.

197
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,590
Shut it, bitch.

198
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,360
I could say the same to you.

199
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,470
Nice of you to finally show up.

200
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,760
I followed the smoke and crawled back from hell.

201
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,900
I appreciate the hard effort,

202
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,460
but you took so long so I already sucked on it.

203
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,580
Though it saved my life.

204
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,600
What are you talking about?

205
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,330
I don't remember using a dirty pipe like that.

206
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,850
My pipe isn't a cheap piece of crap.

207
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,670
It was made by the name brand "Bitch".

208
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,990
You can't buy one here.

209
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,080
If you lost it, you'd better buy me a new one.

210
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,600
...On the surface.

211
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,430
Man...

212
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,310
This is why I can't stand women in the night business.

213
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,010
Talk about being ripped off.

214
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,930
Win or lose, its hell for me.

215
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,610
You half-dead fools.

216
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,500
No matter how many ants you gather,
it won't change a thing.

217
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,050
Why can't you understand?

218
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,440
Why don't you die?

219
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,950
Why do you stand up?

220
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,180
Why do you have that look in your eyes?!

221
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,540
Can't stand...

222
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,350
I can't stand...

223
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,200
those eyes!

224
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,330
Get rid of that look!!

225
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,140
Go, Seita!!

226
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,910
Gin-san!  Tsukuyo-Ne!!

227
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,690

228
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,180
Did we get him?

229
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,890
The thirst...

230
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,140
That undeniable thirst.

231
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,010
No matter how many times I make them fall...

232
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,770
No matter how many times I destroy their hope...

233
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,860
They always stand back up.

234
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,640
Their eyes are the same.

235
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,640
These noble spirits are just like Hinowa's...

236
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,310
I don't need it.

237
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,410
In this eternal night... I do not need a sun!

238
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,120
Every time you fools light a pathetic flame,

239
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,230
I'll wipe it out!

240
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,350
I'll tear apart that abominable body and spirit.

241
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,340
Hinowa-sama!

242
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,680
Bear with us just a little longer!

243
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,790
Hang in there!

244
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,490
There! The rebels!

245
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,100
Damn it! Here, too!

246
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,760
We left behind too many to battle Hosen!

247
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,560
I didn't think so many would still follow him!

248
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,520
...Mom!

249
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,190
We won't be able to escape like this.

250
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,980
Seita... You go on ahead.

251
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,240
Mom!

252
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,620
Don't worry.

253
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,270
I won't tell you to escape by yourself again.

254
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,300
Let's fight.

255
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,770
Together, with everyone.

256
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,750
If I'm here, I can distract the enemy.

257
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,400
You head to the control room.

258
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,700
Defeating Hosen with numbers alone is difficult.

259
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,450
But that doesn't mean we don't have a chance.

260
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,630
Do you know why the King of the Night built Yoshiwara deep underground?

261
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,010
Yes, this place isn't a Shangri-la for anybody.

262
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,360
It was made for that man to escape the sunlight.

263
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,900
A Shangri-la built for that man alone.

264
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,550
More than anything, Hosen hates and fears the sun.

265
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,650
The Yato have always feared the sunlight...

266
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:11,430
What would happen if a Yato, who hadn't seen sunlight in years, was exposed to the sun?

267
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,540
This underground space where Yoshiwara was built,

268
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,280
it was originally a shipyard for building Bakufu ships.

269
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,770
You can't see it now, but there's a hatch in the ceiling for ships to come in and out.

270
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,370
Go to the control room.

271
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,870
If you go there, you can force open this lead-tinted sky.

272
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,490
You're telling me to use you as a decoy for that?

273
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,640
That's...

274
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,240
We won't find freedom if we simply run.

275
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,460
We must fight.

276
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,250
We must fight from inside the cage.

277
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,050
If we don't smash through this cage,
we'll never obtain true freedom.

278
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,010
Let me fight to the end, Seita.

279
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,660
Mom...

280
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,710
The next time we meet, there won't be any cage bars...

281
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,020
So spoil me all you want, okay?

282
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,730

285
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,310

but today we have an important message from TV Tokyo.

299
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,690
Okay.

300
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,660
Well, I'm telling you this important message because they told me to,

301
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,100
and I'm gonna pick my nose while I deliver it,

302
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,520

So here goes.

305
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,860
The current analog broadcast will be ending on July 24, 2011,

After that, analog televisions will require a digital tuner to work properly.
