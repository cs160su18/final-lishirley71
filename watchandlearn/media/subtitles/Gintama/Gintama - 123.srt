A spectacular battle for survival.

The Odd Jobs were subjected
to alien abduction

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,820
by mysterious aliens from
outer space and

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,050
had parts of their bodies modified
into screwdrivers.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,100
Patsuan, it's not a crime to kill
aliens from outer space, right?

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,200
They did it to him! They messed
with Gin-san's analog stick!

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,360
In order to restore their bodies,

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,640
they began playing an online
game called Monkey Hunter.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,720
Along the way, other players
who sought their same goal

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,810
-Katsura, Kondo, Sachan, and
Hasegawa-joined their party.

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,270
Finally, they closed in on players who looked
like the aliens they were searching for...

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,960
They revealed themselves to be...

earlier, but that's enough.

about trying to check us out.

Three weeks, dammit. Three weeks!

Why are we doing such stupid
things three weeks in a row?

52
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,440
We've been doing this for three weeks

53
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,180
and our predicament hasn't
gotten any better.

54
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,480
In fact, it's gotten worse.

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,420
What was the purpose of going
on the hunt in the first place?

56
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,250
What did we gain from
two weeks of hunting?!

Now, now.

58

While it's true we didn't get any useful
information on the alien gamers,

59
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,870
Mon-Hun brought us-comrades, who
share the same objective-together.

60
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,370
This is a prize more precious than any
rare item obtained from the hunt.

61

You call us "comrades," but this assembly
of fools are all hopeless cases.

including his dick-got turned
into a screwdriver. Idiot.

Hey, hey, please calm down!

for us to discuss in person

Let's all just calm down and
have a peaceful talk.

Our party was ultimately never able to obtain
any information on the alien gamers.

74
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,780
Hijikata-san, how did you do?

75
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,330
Why were the two of you using
such confusing avatars?

76
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,380
Because of you, we wasted
an entire week.

77
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,440
No one wants to play inside a game
looking like himself, right?

78
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,400
We did that to lure those aliens to us.

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,940
We never imagined we'd catch people
we didn't give a damn about...like you.

80
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,650
Hijikata-san, that's not entirely true.

and unexpectedly hooked a big fish.

and have a good time!

Your brain is constantly "off."

Your adapter was pulled
from its socket years ago.

Hmph. You fools.

97
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,730
Nothing good will come
from capturing me.

98
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,110
It doesn't change the fact that
you're all screwdrivers.

99
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,310
You're a screwdriver, too, aren't you?

100
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,910
No only that, you'll miss a chance
to obtain valuable information.

101

Katsura, don't tell me; you
have new information?

I might.

103
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,340
When you ask someone for something you
should show the appropriate courtesy.

104
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,210
Kondo-san, don't fall for his tricks.

105
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,690
He's probably making it
up to try and escape.

106
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,580
Look at this before you doubt me.

107
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,110
You'll never talk that
way about me again.

to know the contact number

Why are you showing
us a truck driver ad?!

116
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,900
That's totally the wrong kind of driver!

117

Where's the info on the
alien gamers, nimrod?!

118
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,390
I wouldn't have anything like that.

119
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,880
Are you still going to ignore reality?

120
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,340
You all must've realized that if we haven't found
any information about the alien gamers by now,

121
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,730
we're not ever going to find any.

122
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,240
There's nothing more we can do.

123
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,180
Don't be ridiculous. We're
not giving up so easily.

124
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,480
That's right! We're going
to restore our bodies!

125
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,020
The fight begins right now...

126
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,580
Ack!

127
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,350
Kondo-san...is this...

128
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,100
She's the third princess of Planet
Screw...Princess Phillips.

129
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,230
Actually, there's talk of an arranged
marriage meeting...

130
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,170
Kondo-san, you can't be serious!

131
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,450
What we need to do now...

132
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,780
Is not play Mon-Hun or plan useless
strategies over barbeque.

133
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,770
We need to decide how we're
going to live as screwdrivers.

134
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,010
Thank you very much.

135
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,810
After that, no one spoke a word...

136
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,810
and everyone left the Mon-Hun
party depressed.

137
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,480
Perhaps without realizing
it, we were running away.

138
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,250
The only way to catch the aliens
was through the game.

139
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,540
We kept reminding ourselves of that...

140
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,560
but perhaps all we were doing
was ignoring the harsh reality

141
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,960
we were stuck in and escaping
into the game.

142
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,790
We gave up our online avatars,
and the hunt was over.

143
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,550
Now we had to face reality.

144

Before dawn this morning, Kotaro Katsura,
a central figure among the

145

Anti-Foreigner Faction samurai, who had
been apprehended by the Shinsengumi,

146
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,550
escaped from Oedo Prison, where
he had been incarcerated.

147
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,740
We have a report from the scene
by Ketsuno announcer.

148
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,500
Ketsuno? Ketsuno, are you there?

149
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,090
Yes. This is Ketsuno reporting
from the scene.

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,360
Anti-Foreigner Faction samurai, Kotaro
Katsura, has escaped from prison.

151
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,910
He escaped in just a week.
Zura's pretty good.

152
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,210
Just how did he escape from a
maximum security prison cell?

153
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,070
Yeah. The Shinsengumi's
missing its key members,

154
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,280
Here at the site of the first-ever
escape of this type...

155
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,270
so they couldn't keep him locked up.

156
