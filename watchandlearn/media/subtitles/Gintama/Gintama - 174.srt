00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,030
We're all adults here. You
should understand, yeah?

3
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,240
Bad things happen when
you don't pay your debts.

4
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,820
Yeah, Hasegawa-san?

5
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,050
Mr. Odd Jobs...

6
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,140
You realize that the deadline's
already passed.

7
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,080
Well, yeah...

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,160
Hello?

9
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,430
Yes. Yes.

10
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,390
You're fine with what we're doing?

11
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,770
So we'll go with the plan...

12
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,410
Go fish up some tuna.

13
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,780
["Are There Still People Who Go To The Ocean
And Yell Out 'Bakayaro'?"]

14
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,840
Oh, you guys were also in debt.

15
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,300
No, no, no.

16
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,960
We weren't desperate the way you were.

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,620
We're here on a job.

18
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,580
We're doing someone a favor.

19
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,640
Don't lie!

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,970
You're in the exact same
situation as I am!

21
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,330
We're not!

22
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,790
It may look similar, but it's not!

23
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,890
How?!

24
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,950
We have a different purpose!

25
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,930
The exact same reason...

26
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,990
Same difference!

27
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,580
It's hot...

28
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,540
Hey, pipsqueaks.

29
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,830
Cut the griping.

30
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,520
What do you want, Anna's papa?

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,150
No, he's one of them.

32
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,390
Now listen up.

33
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,530
It doesn't matter why you're here.
Everybody is equal on this ship.

34
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,680
We'll be out at sea for three months.

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,280
Hard labor every day.

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,580
Impossible for ordinary humans to bear.

37
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,400
So what do we...

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
There's only one way.

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,090
Don't worry. It's very simple.

40
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,600
You just have to become men of the sea.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,430
I'll show you how it's done.

42
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,170
That sucker's a real tough one!

43
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,170
Yeah, just like that.

44
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,240
It's actually possible to fish up tuna.

45
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,020
Oh.

46
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,070
It's easy if we just have to shout.

47
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,100
Real Japanese eat ochazuke!

48
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,130
I did it!

49
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,180
Now I can have all the ochazuke I want!

50
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,330
Salmon... A salmon...

51
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,660
People say that fishing is about
patience, but they're wrong.

52
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,670
It's about guts.

53
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,870
Guts?

54
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,950
Give it a try if you want to
become a man of the sea.

55
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,960
Yes. I'll make it to the top one day!

56
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,470
A perfect size for Shinpachi.

57
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,660
I'll give it a try too.

58
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,180
Hatsu! Come back to me!

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,940
Well, this would count as
being a dead fish in bed...

60
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,310
Hey, big guy.

61
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,750
It doesn't matter...

62
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,660
I'm just a Madao.

63
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,200
You idiot!

64
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,140
Don't give up so easily!

65
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,150
Life is like fishing!

66
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,890
You can't give up after
one or two failures...

67
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,800
No, I've failed at least seven
or eight times in a row...

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,160
Then try another hundred
or thousand times!

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,120
If you give up, it's all over!

70
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,070
C-Captain...

71
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,490
And you have your friends.

72
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,370
Gin-san!

73
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,210
Everyone!

74
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,400
It's no big deal.

75
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
I'm gonna do this!

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,890
I'll catch every fish in the damn ocean!

77
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,220
Let's get to it!

78
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,570
We'll return triumphantly
with a big catch in tow!

79
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,960
Gin-san!

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,250
You rule!

81
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,010
That was when the men were united.

82
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,270
They grew tougher and bolder
with each passing day.

83
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,540
They transformed into
true men of the sea.

84
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,260
And time marched on...

85
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,350
Gin-san, we did it.

86
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,010
Yeah, it's a fine haul.

87
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,600
Uh, isn't there something wrong here?

88
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,700
As you'd expect from the
CEO of a big company.

89
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,840
A hefty reward for hushing up an affair.

90
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,980
One, two, three...

91
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,610
Okay, we'll splurge on
some Korean BBQ tonight.

92
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,030
Really? At JoJo-en?

93
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,020
You want me to hang myself?

94
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,590
We're obviously picking one with a buffet.

95
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,700
Kagura-chan will eat a whole cow if
you take her out for Korean BBQ.

96
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,200
I don't mind if it's cheap.

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,390
Where are we going?

98
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,950
There was a place that also had
all-you-can-eat ice cream.

99
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,860
That place.

100
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,380
The place where you can make
your own soft-serve?

101
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,650
That place is nice.

102
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,670
You know, even though I'm all grown up,

103
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,490
I still get excited when ice cream
shoots out of the machine.

104
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,650
I wonder how that works.

105
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,660
I get more excited about the stuff
that shoots out on your rice.

106
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,050
Don't ruin my dreams.

107
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,380
Kids should keep quiet.

108
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,350
This conversation has made
me really hungry.

109
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,310
Sorry about that.

110
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,540
No problem.

111
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,780
Which floor?

112
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,710
Ah, the first floor.

113
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,690
That's right. We had to work early
so we didn't eat breakfast.

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,160
I can't wait to fill up my
belly with cow liver.

115
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,980
I'm more interested in cow tongue.

116
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
Add some lemon juice and
chow down with some rice.

117
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Sounds wonderful.

118
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,220
You're drooling.

119
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,280
Isn't this taking too long?

120
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,900
The building's pretty tall.

121
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,480
I wish it'd hurry up.

122
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,140
My stomach and back are
glaring at each other.

123
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,070
Gin-san, isn't this too long though?

124
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,820
Like Tower of Druaga length?

125
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,120
And it looks like we're stuck
on the 14th floor.

126
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,700
No big deal.

127
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,680
There's probably a huge gap between
the 14th and 13th floors.

128
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,990
I see.

129
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,340
Uh, there shouldn't be
a building like that.

130
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,100
There shouldn't.

131
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,560
I've never heard of a building with
an especially big 14th floor.

132
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,930
And Gin-san, quite frankly...

133
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,290
This elevator hasn't been moving?

134
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,130
The buttons aren't responding.

135
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,470
The door won't open.

136
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,520
Gin-san, is this...

137
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,770
Does this mean...

138
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,150
We're trapped?

139
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,480
On an elevator?

140
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,780
["When a Person Is Trapped, Their Inner Door Opens"]

141
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,120
This sucks!

142
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,450
It had to happen when I'm starving!

143
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,770
Somebody save us!

144
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,130
Help! Help me!

145
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,100
Hold on.

146
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,880
Calm down.

147
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,980
Don't make such a fuss, stupid.

148
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,540
You should be used to this kind of thing.

149
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,130
Don't lose your cool. It's pathetic.

150
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,340
But! What if we can't get out?!

151
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,720
I'll starve to death!

152
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,230
That won't happen.

153
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,730
Elevators have an emergency
button for these situations.

154
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,810
There really is one!

155
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,940
Once we press this, the building manager will
know something is wrong and come help us.

156
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,620
What the hell was that?!

157
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,420
I said to press the emergency button!

158
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,940
Not to kill it!

159
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,580
What are we going to do?!

160
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,540
The entire control panel is busted!

161
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,830
Sorry, I used too much force.

162
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,470
Sorry isn't gonna cut it!

163
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,100
How are we going to call for help?!

164
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,920
C-Calm down...

165
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,790
It'll be fine. Just fine.

166
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,250
Even if the emergency button doesn't work, somebody
in the building should notice the problem.

167
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,440
You people shouldn't panic.

168
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,470
You need to be calm during
these situations.

169
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,040
Uh, excuse me...

170
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,180
Everyone at this company
leaves work by five.

171
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,650
There shouldn't be anyone
left at this time.

172
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,290
Oh, is that so?

173
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:01,100
But a company this big should have
security guards on patrol...

174
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,320
There's no need to worry..

175
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,910
Mikoshiba

176
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,910
Uh, excuse me.

177
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,960
I would be the security guard.

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,290
Somebody save us!

179
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,850
Help! Help me!

180
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,750
And he ends up being
the one that panics.

181
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,860
Hey, man!

182
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,700
If you're the security guard, you should
do something about this situation!

183
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,440
And why are you riding the elevator?!

184
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,620
Shouldn't you be prepared
for the unexpected?

185
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,360
I-I'm sorry.

186
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,950
My stomach was full after eating my bento
on the roof so I didn't want to move...

187
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,210
But everybody will come
to work tomorrow.

188
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,520
Tomorrow?! I haven't eaten anything
today! I can't wait that long!

189
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,120
And Gin-san...

190
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,410
Isn't tomorrow the start
of a three-day weekend?

191
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,080
There was a huge fuss about JUMP
coming out on Saturday this week.

192
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,460
Th-Three-day weekend?

193
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,720
H-Hold on.

194
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,230
That means there's a chance that nobody
will come to this building for four days?

195
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,470
But we always have people working
on holidays, so I'm sure it'll be fine.

196
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,530
How can you be sure?!

197
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,630
Stop your stupid...

198
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,420
It's no use.

199
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,640
I'm so hungry that I don't have
the energy to get angry.

200
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:13,240
I was supposed to be enjoying
spare ribs and cow liver...

201
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,520
Why did this happen?

202
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,360
A-Anyway...

203
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,360
We have no choice but to
wait for help to come.

204
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,860
And I'm sure there are people
working overtime.

205
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,120
Cheer up.

206
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,870
I'm sure someone will notice us.

207
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,270
Someone will come save us.

208
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,570
So we have to hang in there.

209
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,600
How much time has passed?

210
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,960
Isn't any help going to come?

211
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,690
Uh, why don't we talk about something?

212
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,050
It's pretty smothering in this small
elevator if we sit in silence.

213
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,690
Air. We should get some fresh air.

214
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,910
We can't get any fresh air.

215
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,090
Since the four of us are stuck
in this small box forever,

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,560
breathing the same air that
gets worse and worse.

217
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,340
Uh, could we avoid any negative topics?

218
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,000
Is it just me or are we running out of air?

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
It's hard to breathe.

220
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,480
Are we going to run out of air and
die before any help comes?

221
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,110
Are we going to suffocate to death?

222
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,130
Uh, Kagura-chan...

223
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,040
Don't be stupid.

224
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,000
There won't be
any help.

225
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,940
Stop that.

226
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,080
Hey...

227
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,760
Gin-san?

228
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,710
We're going to rot to death in
here without anyone noticing.

229
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,450
C'mon.

230
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,790
I said to stop that!

231
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,500
Stop being negative.

232
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,730
It's not like you.

233
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,320
This is the time to think happy thoughts.

234
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,840
Get a grip!

235
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,830
Right, Mikoshiba-san?

236
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,210
Can you think of a fun topic?

237
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,860
Fun topic...?

238
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,980
Oh, that's right.

239
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,970
Mikoshiba-san, how long have
you been working here?

240
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,850
A little over three years, I think.

241
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,780
Oh, so you just switched jobs recently.

242
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,080
No, not exactly...

243
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,390
I began working at night three years ago.

244
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,950
I'm a salaryman during the day.

245
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,280
Oh? That sounds rough.

246
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,660
You don't get any time to rest.

247
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,960
Yes...

248
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,450
Well, it is pretty rough.

249
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,780
Well, there's a house involved...

250
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,190
Oh, you're saving up money
to buy a house.

251
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,180
I see. The father is fired
up to own a house.

252
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,410
That's so cool.

253
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,510
No, uh...

254
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,550
The house was the one on fire...

255
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,850
It happened when there were
still loans on the house.

256
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,310
So I'm working to pay those off...

257
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,870
Oh... I... I see...

258
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,610
Sorry about that.

259
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,650
No, it's okay...

260
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,440
Shoot!

261
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,620
Instead of lightening the mood
with a happy conversation,

262
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,770
I made it worse by asking
the wrong question!

263
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,640
It's no good!

264
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,200
You shouldn't pry into
other people's past!

265
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,450
Let's change the subject!

266
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,270
That's right!

267
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,590
What does everyone want to
do once we get out of here?

268
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,470
I'm all for Korean BBQ.

269
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,630
I'm sure it'll taste marvelous
on an empty stomach.

270
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,660
Hunger is the best spice.

271
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,300
When you look at it that way, this situation
is merely preparing us to eat Korean BBQ.

272
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,030
Ah, that's a wonderful way to look at it.

273
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,010
That makes this feel less painful.

274
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,500
Right?

275
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,760
Ah, why don't you join us for
Korean BBQ, Mikoshiba-san?

276
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,960
We must have been brought
together for a reason.

277
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,430
I'll pass...

278
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,290
I never want to see a lit stove again...

279
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,310
We went from Korean BBQ to fire!

280
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,390
This is bad!

281
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,710
I hit another sore subject!

282
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,790
If only we hadn't done
Korean BBQ on the lawn...

283
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,660
That's why I said we should
go to Ushi-kaku.

284
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,660
[Note: Parody of Gyu-kaku, a popular
Korean BBQ chain in the US and Japan.]

285
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,200
Uh...

286
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,820
I'm really sorry.

287
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,300
No, it's okay.

288
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,990
The mood!

289
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,180
It's getting gloomier in here!

290
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,400
I have to do something!

291
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,310
Th-That's it...

292
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,630
So you don't really like Korean BBQ, huh?

293
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,550
Is there some other food
you really enjoy?

294
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,560
A food I enjoy?

295
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,560
The bento my wife made
for me, I suppose.

296
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,250
Ah, you said you were
eating one just now.

297
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,900
A bento from your loving wife?

298
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,000
N-No...

299
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,130
Come on. You're making
me burn up with envy.

300
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,310
Yes, it all burned up..

301
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,410
My wife... My house...

302
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,960
Everything I cared about...

303
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,430
That wasn't what I meant!

304
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,280
This is bad!

305
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,470
This person keeps dragging the
conversation back to that point!

306
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,350
Uh, sorry...

307
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,350
That wasn't what I meant...

308
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,350
I'm sorry.

309
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,430
Hey!

310
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,900
The mood in here is terrible!

311
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,610
What do I do?!

312
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,660
I understand. It's okay.

313
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,740
It was all my fault.

314
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,850
I'm a terrible security guard.

315
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,480
I couldn't even protect my wife...

316
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,410
You don't have to worry about it.

317
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,660
You'll be going to see your
wife soon enough.

318
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,200
You're right...

319
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,460
The pessimism is spreading!

320
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,700
I-It's suffocating...

321
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,360
The suffocating pressure
in this enclosed space...

322
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,020
If I don't say something,

323
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,810
I'll go insane!

324
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,250
A simple conversation won't be enough
to get rid of this heavy mood.

325
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,590
I'll have to do something more direct!

326
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,700
Uh...

327
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,740
Why don't we play a game?

328
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,670
Huh? What's with you?

329
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,150
Just leave us alone.

330
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,490
It'd be a waste of time to sit around
while we wait for help.

331
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,540
There isn't any help coming.

332
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,940
I'm looking back at my life.

333
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,240
Can't you quiet down?

334
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,200
You can't let yourself be absorbed
by this negative atmosphere!

335
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,970
Help will surely come!

336
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,600
Until then, we have to help and
encourage one another!

337
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,830
It's a little old, but let's
play Magical Banana!

338
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,630
We'll make a word chain with positive
things to lighten the mood!

339
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,700
Got it?

340
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,850
Let's go!

341
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:16,730
Okay!

342
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,670
Hey, what's wrong with this guy?

343
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,700
Why is he so psyched up?

344
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,160
He must have been sent by Bando.

345
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,960
Hand over some boiled eggs.

346
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,730
Okay! Magical Banana!

347
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,190
Bananas remind me of yellow! Okay!

348
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,110
Yellow reminds me of bananas.

349
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,920
Okay!

350
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,610
Bananas remind me of yellow.

351
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,530
Okay!

352
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,490
Yellow reminds me of
the flames on that day...

353
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,230
Uh, h-hold on a sec.

354
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,650
"The flames on that day" doesn't
really mean anything to us...

355
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,930
Oh, sorry about that...

356
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,990
The image is burned into my mind...

357
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,420
Sorry.

358
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,850
Can we try to be positive here?

359
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,590
Forget about the past.

360
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,300
Yes...

361
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,790
And don't do a half-assed job by
repeating the same two words.

362
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,720
You can't use anything that's
already been used once.

363
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,730
Got it?

364
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,750
Let's try this one more time.

365
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,110
Then we'll use the word
"flames" from what he said.

366
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,920
Okay!

367
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,940
Magical Banana!

368
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,730
Flames remind me of bright!

369
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,760
Okay!

370
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
Bright reminds me of light.

371
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,570
Okay!

372
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,200
Light reminds me of what
we'll never see again.

373
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,100
Okay!

374
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,710
What we'll never see again reminds
me of my family on that day...

375
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,350
F-Family reminds me of a happy circle!

376
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,240
Okay!

377
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,940
A happy circle, but everybody dies alone.

378
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,350
Death reminds me of goodbyes.

379
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,000
Goodbye would be what I wasn't
able to say on that day...

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,730
Forget it!

381
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,780
How negative are you people?!

382
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,220
Give me a break, damn it!

383
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,240
I've never heard of such a sad
game of Magical Banana!

384
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,140
I keep trying to lighten the mood
and you just drag it back down!

385
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,640
And how many times do I have to
tell you to forget about that day?!

386
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm sorry...

387
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,330
I understand that it's hard!

388
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,890
But you won't be able to move
on if you keep looking back!

389
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,910
We can't even get through a
round of Magical Banana!

390
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:05,830
Yes.

391
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,380
I won't even insist on being positive now.

392
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,280
Just go with the flow and say the
first thing that comes to mind!

393
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,180
We're still doing this?

394
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,610
Just give it up...

395
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,740
Shut up!

396
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,840
Going with the flow should help us relax!

397
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,810
Mikoshiba-san!

398
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,000
There won't be any problems
this time, right?!

399
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,570
Yes! I'll forget about what
happened on that day!

400
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,830
I'll put it behind me!

401
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,800
Good!

402
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,020
Let's go then!

403
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,610
Okay!

404
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,690
Magical Banana!

405
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,560
Bananas are long!

406
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,390
Okay!

407
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,310
Long reminds me of straws.

408
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,250
Okay!

409
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,280
Straws remind me of plastic.

410
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,080
Okay!

411
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,230
Plastic reminds me of my wife.

412
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,030
Hold it right there!

413
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,520
What did you just say?!

414
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,000
What do you mean, plastic
reminds you of your wife?!

415
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,160
Well, my wife burned up
at an unreal speed.

416
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,300
That was when I realized
she was plastic...

417
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,080
Dude!

418
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,210
That was just a b***-up doll!

419
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,230
You're gonna have a fire if
you leave one by a stove!

420
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,660
Way to make the air in this room
so heavy, you sick security guard!

421
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,520
Since you have to use air to blow it up...

422
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,120
That wasn't clever!

423
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,530
Shinpachi!

424
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,470
You idiot.

425
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,010
This is what you get for yelling
in a room with no air.

426
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,200
Hang in there, Shinpachi!

427
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,260
That's good...

428
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,510
The two of you are back to normal...

429
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,070
Did Magical Banana do the trick?

430
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,030
Guess not.

431
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,780
Besides, it'd be wrong for
Gin-san and Kagura-chan

432
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:42,530
to sit and wait for help if they
got injured on the street.

433
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:48,320
That's not how you're meant to be.

434
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,450
W-Wait, what are you people doing?

435
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,900
What is the meaning of this?

436
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,500
Let's go have some Korean BBQ.

437
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,130
If a friend is hurt,

438
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:31,510
you'll make your own path if that's
what it takes to get him home.

439
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,510
That's how you people are.

440
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,900
Wait! It's impossible to
leave on your own!

441
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,570
It's too dangerous!

442
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,110
Shinpachi!

443
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,820
It's only a little longer so hang in there!

444
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,590
Hey! You listening to me?!

445
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,450
Are you even conscious?!

446
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,300
Hey! Hey!

447
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,580
I don't have a choice...

448
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,310
Magical Banana!

449
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,790
Bananas are a fruit with no equal!

450
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,220
Can't forget about Odd Jobs when
talking about having no equal.

451
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,220
And what does Odd Jobs
reminds you of?

452
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,040
The best.

453
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,640
The best would be Kagura-chan!

454
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,070
Kagura-chan would be the worst!

455
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,340
The worst would be Catherine...

456
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,930
Catherine reminds me of cat ears!

457
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,340
Can I make my own path...?

458
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,960
Sorry for the long wait.

459
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,000
We're here to help.

460
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,950
Huh?

461
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,450
No!

462
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,510
No! No! No!

463
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,020
The next episode...
"People Of All Ages Hate The Dentist!"

464
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,150
[Gintoki, lover of alcohol and sweets,
is destined to have a cavity.]

465
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,990
[An unheard method of treatment is provided
at the suspicious-sounding Buddha dental clinic.]

466
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,240
[See you next time.]
