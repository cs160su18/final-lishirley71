Still great when sucked
straight from the bottle!

Hey, everyone!

14
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,870
Is everybody doing slurpingly well today?

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,430
Here's an announcement from Mayorin!

16
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,740
Does anybody want to know where mayonnaise
comes from and how it gets to you?

17
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,240
Guess what?

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,870
Whoever finds a ticket, 1 in every 30,000 bottles,
gets an invitation to Mayorin's home!

19
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,280
Mayo lovers should suck
away to find a ticket!

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,750
I'll be waiting!

21
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,000
That was a squishy message for your dinner
table from Mayorin Mayonnaise.

And so starting today, amendment

25
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,850
as you can see,

26
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,620
Less than Five Mayonnaise a Day is Unacceptable.

27
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,880
requires each person to consume
five bottles of mayonnaise a day!

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,410
What?!

29
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,050
Shut up!

30
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,260
This is an order from your
Vice-commander!

31
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,960
What is this?

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,950
We were told to assemble on short
notice for the sake of this order?

33
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,690
Maybe the Vice-commander's lost his mind
after eating too much mayonnaise...

34

What is it, Sogo?

36
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,560
Well, I don't know what you're plotting,

37
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,680
but I can't understand why the rest of us
have to go along with your mayo fetish.

38
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Eh?

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,520
'Sides, it's got nothing to do
with the samurai code.

Yeah! Yeah!

41
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,530
This is oppressive, even
for the Vice-commander!

42
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,650
Toshi, when you decide something, you need to
explain it in a way that everyone else can accept.

43
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,700
This is too much even for...

44
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,980
Hey, Yamazaki.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,390
Explain this to everyone.

46
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,980
Huh?!

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,420
U-Uh, no, but...

48
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,240
You never told me anything...

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,420
In fact, I'd like to have this explained
to me, you know...?

Hey, I'll kill you.

Listen up, you morons!

Ya' think keeping the streets safe is enough for us
Shinsengumi during the time of this great recession?!

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,240
We need to keep the economy safe too!

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,860
Gotta do our part in building
domestic demand!

55
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,930
Consume lots of mayonnaise
to help the economy recover!

56
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,350
Our organization needs to appeal
to the public in multiple ways!

You got that, fools?!

Okay, good job.

59
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,390
Everybody who understands
should applaud.

dinner table from Mayorin Mayonnaise.

80
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,730
What's wrong, Yamazaki?!

81
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,520
Vice-commander, please look at this!

82
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,810
I was squeezing mayonnaise out
when a weird piece of paper...

83
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,510
Th-This is!

84
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,540
This is it!!

85
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,080
What do we do with this?

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,990
We should probably call the manufacturer
to complain about a foreign object...

87
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Ya-Yamazaki, that's...

88
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,400
Congratulations.

89

90
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,330
Isn't that great, Yamazaki?

91
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,920
You can go to the mayonnaise
factory now.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,740
Huh?

93
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,360
Oh? You look pale, Hijikata-san.

94
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,010
What? Did you force everybody to eat mayonnaise
because you wanted to go to the factory?

95
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,360
Even if it means taking away someone
else's winning ticket?

96
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,900
O-Of course not, you fool!

97
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,430
We said that it was to help
build domestic demand!

98
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,640
H-He figured it out!

99

That's good to hear.

100
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,100
I couldn't imagine that the Vice-commander would
take a winning ticket from a subordinate.

101
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,460
Then go have fun at the mayonnaise
factory, Yamazaki.

102

I-I don't really understand...

103
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,290

down, for crying out loud.

338
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,270
Sorry.

339

This is bad.

340

Bad.

341

Uh...

344
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,090
So you won't need to destroy our planet if
we do something about your queen, right?

345
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,170
Gotcha.

346
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,610
We'll be responsible for that.

347
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,920
In return, you'll leave if we patch
up your queen, yeah?

What?! You're saying that you
can bring the Lady back?!

349

You know what's gonna happen
to this planet if you fail!

350
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,670
Gin-san, what do you intend to do?

351
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,250
The fate of the planet is in our hands.

352

Don't worry.

353

There's a way.

354
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,140
We just have to find another queen.

355
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,250

356

Did you forget?

357
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,950
These popped up all over
the place overnight.

358
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,760
That wasn't the only hive
built on these grounds.

359
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,250
We'll talk to the other hives and
ask if their queens can help out.

360
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,950
Is that possible?!

up others who were in the same middle school?!

I brought plenty of honey
for negotiating purposes.

They won't turn us away.

364

Okay, I'm off then!

370
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,760
Did they go to harvest pollen?

371
