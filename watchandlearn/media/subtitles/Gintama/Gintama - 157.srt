So yesterday, we introduced Shunnosuke Oguri-kun.

Huh, you've never released one before.

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,960
Yes.

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,360
In the anime, they make it sound like I'm releasing single after single,

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,350
but in real life, we get all kinds of complaints after I perform.

49
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,010
The lyrics consist of censored words to begin with...

Let's move on.

Well, you've finally released a CD,

so let's drop the risky talk.

What?!

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,230
Isn't it a little early?

58
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,750
We haven't even done the hundred person survey yet.

59
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,940
We sang during the opening for the first time in a while,

60
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,690
so we're out of time.

61

63
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,250
You're okay with that?!

64
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,840
Isn't that the wrong time to agree?!

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,310

Everybody, thank you so poop for coming to my concert today!

69
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,550
Though it pains me, this will be the last song.

70
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,270
Of course, I'll be singing "Your Mom's a BLEEP"!

71
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:19,280

Thank you very much!

74
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,330
Please be careful on your way home!

75
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,920
Wasn't that crazy, Shin-chan?

76
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,510
Otsu-chan's concerts are the best.

77
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,190
Nothing can replace the sense of unity in a concert hall.

78
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,020
If I had to find something wrong,

79
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,960
it'd be their use of an acoustic version of the classic,

80
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,270
"Your Grandpa Stands Too Much When He's Pedaling."

81
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,620
The arrangement wasn't bad, but personally, I'd have preferred the original.

82
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,770
And for the classic, "Your Granny's Wearing Your Basketball Shoes,"

83
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,470
they turned the mic to the audience so we couldn't hear Otsu-chan singing.

84
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,900
Even if they wanted the audience to feel like part of the performance,

85
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,570
it was rather unfortunate.

86
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,080
Hey, cut the griping, people!

87
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,940
Concerts and CDs are good in different ways!

88
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,170
Either way, Otsu-chan rules!

89
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,390
Right, Shin-chan?

90
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,070
Shin-chan?

91
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,590
Chief, what's wrong?

92
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,440
You seem a little down today.

93
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,320
Considering it was an Otsu-chan concert... Is something wrong?

94
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,480
You're right.

95
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,510
Today was an Otsu-chan concert.

96
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,980
The most important day for us members of the Tsu Terakado Fan Club.

97
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,240
A special day that cannot be replaced.

98
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,940
And yet...

99
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,240

Open parentheses. Sis is the exception. Closed Parentheses.

105
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,010
Yet look at this showing!

106
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,580
What happened to the other members?!

107
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,150
Did you contact everybody?!

Which rotten idol did they switch to?!

125
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:40,450
Did they forget the 14th clause of our creed:
"Ignore any idol who isn't Otsu-chan"?!

C-Calm down, Shin-chan!

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,380
I won't calm down!

129
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,860
I'll barge into every single one of their homes

130
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,890
and make them do push-ups while reciting the club creed!

Y-You've got it wrong, Shin-chan.

They didn't quit being Otsu-chan's fans by choice!

Just let it go, Mr. Shimura.

137
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,240
We could never tell you.

138
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,130
We didn't leave because of Otsu-chan.

139
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,320
Mr. Shimura, we could never say that we couldn't stand your methods...

140
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,160
Wh-What's with all of you?!

Don't you feel ashamed to show your face here?!

147
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,240
You should be the ones to feel ashamed.

148
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,380
Fan Clubs of hard-line idols are relics of the past

from the age of Chinko Matsuda and Bakina Nakamori.

Your methods are old-fashioned.

["Any Place with a Bunch of Men Gathered Around Will Turn into a Battlefield"]

159
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,050
Our story is set during the Warring Tsu Terakado Fan Clubs Period.

160
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,190
Tsu Terakado had overcome scandal and achieved the position of top idol.

161
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:32,730
Countless numbers of fan clubs engaged in a furious battle for dominance.

162
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,840
Men fell in battle as they strived for supreme hegemony, the title of official fan club.

163
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,690
On this corpse-riddled battlefield was a group of men considered the strongest.

The strongest otaku led by their brave general, Shinpachi Shimura!

166
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,870
Veterans among veterans who had supported Tsu Terakado back when she sang on the street.

167
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,010
Bound by an ironclad creed numbering 99 clauses,

168
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,270
they had frighteningly high morale and did not know defeat in battle.

169
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:21,790
They dominated every other faction in performance quality, energy, obnoxiousness and lack of women.

170
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,020
Their long history placed them nearest to the title of official,

171
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,400
so they were under constant attack from other factions.

172
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,650
But the elite forces trained by the brave general Shimura were difficult to defeat,

173
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,550
and the piles of their challengers' corpses grew taller.

174
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,700
It was difficult situation to change.

175
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,930
As many soldiers began laying down their weapons,

176
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,320
a man appeared.

177
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,540
The brilliant general, Toshi!

178
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,180
He appeared on the battlefield like a shooting star

179
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,960
and cleverly manipulated the deserters into his own faction named the Tsusengumi.

180
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,320
Unlike the others who could only revolt and fight,

181
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,660
he didn't fight.

182
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,620
He understood the workings of the heart of an otaku

183
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,700
and enticed one after another to join from different factions.

184
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,390
In no time, he had the largest force of all.

185
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,670
The Tsusengumi he created, which covered everything from

186
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,750
anime, manga, games, and other 2D media to 3D media,

187
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,460
was not beholden to Otsu.

188
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,650
A group of chosen otaku who used all kinds of media.

189
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,650
You could call it a Universal Media Club.

190
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,160
His methods, considered to be soft-line,

191
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,540
were refreshing to the hard-line, old-fashioned otaku who only followed Otsu.

192
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,810
An otaku creed began to spread.

193
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,110
It didn't take long for him to be considered a charismatic otaku.

194
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,270
And it goes without saying that the members of the Tsu Terakado Fan Club

195
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:06,920
who were forced by ironclad principles to suppress their desires were the first to fall.

196
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,210
They could no longer hear the voice of the brave general Shimura, who once inspired fear in all.

197
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,040
Once on the verge of conquering the world,

198
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,860
the Tsu Terakado Fan Club was now on the verge of ruin.

199
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:27,100
The arrival of a new star led to the curtain falling on this long period of war.

200
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,890
Yeah, this week's GinTama was short...

201
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,970
Why are you ending it already?!

202
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,240
It's not over!

203
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,770
The manga and fan club aren't over!

204
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,880
How is that okay?!

205
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,150
It's obviously not okay!

206
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,280
And next week's is a totally unrelated story!

207
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,990
This is just your personal wish!

208
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,380
That's enough, yeah?

209
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,860
We can end it.

210
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,520
The narration was pretty intense.

211
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,820
It can't be over!

212
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,720
Only half the episode's been used up!

213
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,990
How could it end at such a horrible juncture?!

214
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,650
Just forget it.

215
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,710
We'd just have to listen to your eternal bitching.

216
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,800
It's a pain. Don't wanna hear it.

217
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,350
Let it end. I'm begging you.

218
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,770
Who cares about idols and whatever?

219
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,200
Go do it by yourself.

220
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,380
It's a waste of time, you piece of trash.

221
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,430
You don't have to put it that way!

222
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,780
I'm gonna cry!

223
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:26,360
You should know how much effort I've put into this fan club!

224
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,700
How much I love Otsu-chan!

225
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,820
And now, the fan club is on the verge of disbanding!

226
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,890
After cheering and supporting Otsu-chan this whole time...

227
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,210
Before anyone else did!

228
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,050
And then some random guy shows up and steals my members and status!

229
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,230
They're trying to steal my dream of becoming Otsu-chan's official fan club!

230
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,230
Unbelievable...

231
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,410
I didn't think that man would still be alive...

232
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,750
I thought he'd been destroyed by now...

233
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,510
The curse has yet to be broken...

234
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,510
That man still lived inside of Hijikata-san...

235
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,250
And he's a suped-up otaku now!

236
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:14,280
How can some half-assed idol otaku like us compete with that charismatic otaku?

237
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,210
Do we even stand a chance?!

238
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,630
Shin-chan!

239
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,060
You can't give up!

240
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,760
The fight isn't over yet!

241
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,710
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club hasn't died yet!

242
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,580
You still have a member!

243
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,500
Right here!

244
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,210
Takachin...

245
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,740
There should still be fan clubs that haven't been absorbed by him!

246
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,250
Let's join up with them to fight against him!

247
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,570
We'll show that guy! And the people who betrayed us!

248
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,060
Our fight has just begun!

249
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,070
As long as evil exists, their battle will continue.

250
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,560
Forever.

251
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,470
And GinTama just ended...

252
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,560
Don't end the series!

253
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,840
Why are you trying to turn this into an incomplete manga?!

254
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,040
It's true that these endings happen!

255
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,920
That most endings are this way!

256
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,230
But are you that desperate to not hear our story?!

257
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,430
You're going to end the series so you don't have to hear it?!

258
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,190
I don't really understand official fan clubs or the like.

259
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,030
What are you people trying to do?

260
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,480
What? Official?

261
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,890
So you win the war and become official.

262
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,080
Then what do you have?

263
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,140
Do you get to go out with Otsu-chan?

264
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,940
Do you get to kiss Otsu-chan?

265
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,370
Do you get to **** or XXXX or !@##%%?

266
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,230
You don't.

267
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,030
Official gets you a couple of biscuits and that's that.

268
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,850
Hell no! Why biscuits?!

269
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,540
Then I'll give you some biscuits.

270
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,850
Good enough?

271
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,560
Scram, moron. Official moron.

272
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,320
Shut up, moron!

273
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,180
Biscuit moron!

274
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,730
Official biscuit moron!

275
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,840
Hey, he has no intention of listening to us.

276
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,060
He isn't treating us like fellow humans.

277
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,420
Gin-san, it's a great honor to be acknowledged as the official fan club.

278
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,280
So far, we've been supporting Otsu-chan one-sidedly,

279
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,770
but if we become official,

280
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,040
that means that Otsu-chan is asking us to cheer for her!

281
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,970
She'll be depending on us!

282
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,240
Not much difference.

283
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,210
There is!

284
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,920
Our motivation will get a huge boost!

285
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,160
Basically, becoming official is like becoming the palace army led by the Shogun!

286
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,430
Which means that those who aren't chosen are considered rebels!

287
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,500
Could there be a greater dishonor?!

288
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,450
It's such an aggravating thing to happen after cheering for so long!

289
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,320
Then you can just join that group.

290
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,330
Then you can all be members of the official fan club.

291
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,050
We can't join a group with those people!

292
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:37,940
They're a bunch of traitors and seditionists who encouraged the traitors!

293
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,840
That's right!

294
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,690
Besides, they're following all kinds of idols besides Otsu-chan!

295
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,180
We're the ones who truly love Otsu-chan!

296
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,680
We're more fit to be official!

297
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,200
I don't need a member number below those freaks!

298
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,220
Don't be so anal.

299
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,400
It's all the same shit, yeah?

300
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,050
So just get along.

301
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,650
There isn't any difference between member #1 and member #100.

302
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,430
As far as an idol's concerned, fan club members are like smegma.

303
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,030
There isn't any difference between Smegma A and Smegma Z, yeah?

304
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,550
'Cause you're still smegma.

305
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,910
If you understand, go make up and drink a liter of soy sauce.

306
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,300
And die, you morons.

307
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,730
Gin-san!

308
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,390
You're going to voluntarily surrender to my troops?

309
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,450
I don't particularly mind,

310
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,510
but I recommend that you calm down and reevaluate the situation.

311
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,060
I may have won the battle of size,

312
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:38,200
but it appears that the title of official isn't something that can simply be won by numbers.

313
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,410
Y-You bastard...

314
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,740
How dare you show your face here?!

315
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,470
Uh, could you not walk into someone else's house without permission?

316
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,560
Mr. Sakata,

317
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,120
I recommend you turn on the TV.

318
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,600
What's with this guy?

319
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,690
He walks into somebody else's house without permission and makes recommendations all over the place.

320
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,040
The interview has just begun.

321
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,950
We'll go to reporter, Shoji-san.

322
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,200
Yes, this is reporter, Shoji.

323
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,350
The interview has just begun.

324
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,870
Yes...

325
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,000
I love all the people who listen to my songs.

326
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,100
I consider them all irreplaceable.

327
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,120
Which is why...

328
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,520
I didn't want to assign ranks to my precious fans...

329
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,970
I really didn't want that...

330
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,090
That's why I tried to avoid having to make such decisions.

331
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,590
But I heard that my fans were getting into big fights as a result.

332
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,850
So I wasn't sure what I should do.

333
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:41,660
That was when this program came to me and asked if I would make a decision.

334
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,690
I'm going to make a Tsu Terakado official fan club! Strong as a diamond!

335
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,850

340
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,680

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,080
Measure of finances!

342
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,750
Measure of Takeuchi!

343
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,780

344
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,170

Shout out with everything that might make you popular!

346
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,570
Scream your love for Otsu-chan!

347
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,340
The long battle between the men

348
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,880
will finally be brought to a conclusion!

349
