00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,130
I guess I have to sell my sword.

155
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,190
He's really pathetic! He's trying to sell
his samurai soul to get a figurine!!

156
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,190
I've tried to sell it many times,
but I can't seem to let go of it.

157
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:40,160
The guy at the store said that it was a cursed
demonic sword, but that can't be...

158
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,810
Oh! Do you think that maybe I'll
wake up in the morning to find

159
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,340
this demonic sword has changed into
a beautiful girl sleeping next to me?

160
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,150
Oh! I'm beginning to love that idea...

161
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,940
[Swordsmith]

162
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,760
This blade pattern on the
front and the back...

163
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
There's no mistake. This is Muramasha.

164
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
[Note: Spoof of legendary evil sword "Muramasa."]

165
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Muramasha?

166
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,280
[Note: Spoof of legendary swordsmith
"Senko Muramasa."]

167
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,280
It is a famous sword forged by Muramasha Senko,
a swordsmith from the Muromachi Era.

168
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,450
It is said to cut incredibly well.

169
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,420
It is also known as a demonic sword
that devours human souls.

170
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,130
A demonic sword? Is it really
a demonic sword?!

171
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,630
Will a beautiful girl come out of it?!

172
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,430
Well... Umm...

173
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,610
A demonic sword?

174
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,310
What kind of demonic sword is it?

175
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,140
It apparently harbors the grudge
of a hikikomori boy

176
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,790
who was slain by his mother
with the Muramasha.

177
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,500
What kind of demonic sword is that?!

178
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,410
According to legend, the son
never went to school...

179
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,650
And always watched anime. But he said
he wanted to go on a school trip.

180
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,630
As expected, his mother snapped.

181
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,800
Muramasha is the sword she used.

182
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,340
What a realistic legend! That
happened recently, didn't it?!

183
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,460
That sounds like it was on
the news, doesn't it?!

184
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,060
Those who carry Muramasha
at their sides

185
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,680
will become possessed by the
grudge of the hikikomori son.

186
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,880
Their interest in anime and two-dimensional
media will increase,

187
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,070
and their interest in work and fighting
will decrease proportionately.

188
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,440
In other words, he'll become
a hopeless otaku.

189
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,260
But there are many counterfeits
of this sword.

190
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,030
Even if it is a real sword,

191
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,180
there's an even lower chance that
it's the sword of legend. But...

192
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,740
If this is the real demon sword...

193
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,930
There may not be anything left
of that man's original soul.

194
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,240
It's likely the demonic sword has devoured him
and he's already become a different person.

195
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,510
He'll probably never return
to his former self.

196
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,580
Do you understand me, Shinohara-kun?

197
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,140
What do you think is the greatest
misfortune for a warrior?

198
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,020
It's the misfortune of not
being understood.

199
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,990
No matter how much skill you have...

200
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,810
No matter how hard you try, you
will never be judged properly.

201
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,990
You will never be given food
that is suited for your stature.

202
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,460
There is no greater misfortune.

203
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,030
Like Li Mu of Zhao and Yue
Fei of Southern Song...

204
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,590
There were many great generals who
faded away along with their skills...

205
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,980
While serving stupid rulers.

206
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,140
I also never had someone
who truly understood me.

207
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,210
Even when I was called a
child prodigy at school,

208
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,350
or when I mastered the distinguished Hokuto Itto,

209
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,000
I went along with the times and even associated
with Anti-Foreigner Faction members.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,150
But wherever I went, nothing
was satisfying enough.

211
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,940
I never thought that I
would find it here.

212
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,060
That man understands me the most.

213
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,220
That man knows I'm too good
for the Shinsengumi.

214
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,580
He knows that I will not end
up serving the likes of Kondo.

215
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
He knows what I thirst for...

216
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,300
My greatest misfortune is that the person who
understands me the most is my enemy.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,310
Well, that's fine.

218
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,110
If there isn't anyone who understands me,
I just have to make everyone recognize me.

219
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,440
The most dangerous man is gone.

220
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,110
All that's left

221
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,120
is to kill Isao Kondo and make
the Shinsengumi mine.

222
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,640
That man... It's as the Vice-Chief said...

223
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,770
I need to tell the Vice-Chief... I need to
let the Vice-Chief know immediately.

224
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,630
You... Could it be?!

225
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,500
My, my, I came to smoke
my last cigarette.

226
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,320
Of all the people to last see...

227
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,500
I've become a total degenerate.

228
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:50,190
Oh well... This is it for me... I'll cling
onto anything, even straw...

229
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:50,190
[Note: From the proverb, "A drowning
man will grasp at a straw."]

230
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,510
Listen up. This is my first
and last request for you.

231
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,690
I never expected...

232
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,490
Ito to be allied with them.

233
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,260
I need to tell the Vice-Chief
immediately...

234
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
The Vice-Chief ...

235
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,700
Please...

236
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,210
The Shinsengumi...

237
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,680
My... Our Shinsengumi...

238
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,610
Protect it...

239
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,750
Please...

240
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,950
Y-You're...

241
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,360
The Kiheitai... Swordsman...

242
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,300
Bansai...Kawakami...

243
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,990
I-Ito...

244
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,920
You bastard...

245
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,210
You were secretly associating
with the enemy.

246
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,090
Yamazaki-kun, the world won't change
if we keep on sword fighting like you.

247
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,090
We must be smarter.

248
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,980
No matter how much we swing our swords,
we cannot stamp out crime.

249
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,230
Furthermore, you mustn't forget
that if they weren't around,

250
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,100
there would be no use for us police.

251
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,340
I'm sure it would be better for
us to work with each other.

252
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,290
We can become partners who work for each
other's profit and maintain balance.

253
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,550
The Shinsengumi won't become
any stronger if we

254
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,180
continue to do things the
way your superior does.

255
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,130
I will change the Shinsengumi.

256
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,240
It'll become stronger and bigger.

257
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,750
And I, Kamotaro Ito, will become the
spear that shows our potential

258
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,280
to take control of the country.

259
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,160
Do what you want...

260
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,710
But let me say this.

261
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:57,400
We may be uneducated and can't
tell how skilled you are...

262
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:04,110
But no one will follow an empty vessel
with no bushido or principles.

263
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,050
I'll follow them...

264
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Until the end...

265
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,660
You'll continue on struggling to inform them
of what you've discovered until the very end.

266
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,630
As their spy, are you saying
that is part of your bushido?

267
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,770
Bansai-dono, I leave the rest to you.

268
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,440
I'll give you the honor of dying in a battle
against an Anti-Foreigner Faction member.

269
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,900
Aren't you glad? You can maintain
that bushido you love so much.

270
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,500
I'll be sure to tell that to your superiors.

271
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,070
No...

272
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,390
I suppose there's no need for that.

273
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,320
They'll be headed to where
you're going soon enough.

274
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,280
There's something going on within
the Shinsengumi right now.

275
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,380
Is that it?

276
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,650
Do you think Hijikata-san was fired from
the Shinsengumi because of that?

277
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,370
Who knows? Well, whatever happens,
it's none of our business.

278
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,640
Let's avoid getting involved any further.

279
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,360
But Hijikata-san asked us
of all people to help him.

280
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,890
Hijikata is very prideful.

281
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,620
For him to put aside his
shame and self-respect,

282
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,960
and ask someone to do something for
him... It must be pretty serious...

283
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,160
Umm...

284
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,150
Excuse me, Mr. Sakata, but...

285
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,760
A rare limited-edition figurine
is going on sale tomorrow.

286
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,540
It's limited to one per customer.

287
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:38,990
But I want to buy three: one to preserve,
one to look at, and one to use.

288
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,870
So I order you to come with me...

289
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,820
You should get some shame
and self-respect!

290
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,030
"To use"? What are you
planning to use it for?!

291
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,890
I feel stupid for worrying about you!!

292
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,760
[Shinsengumi]

293
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,970
Vice-Chief ...

294
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,000
We finally found you.

295
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,570
Bad news, Vice-Chief!

296
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,430
Come back to the squad immediately.

297
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,180
What happened?

298
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,500
Yamazaki-san... Yamazaki-san...

299
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,170
Someone killed him.

300
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,620
Y-Yamazaki-san?!

301
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,010
We found him on the ground, covered
in blood just outside the headquarters.

302
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,820
By that time...

303
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,520
We still haven't found the killer.

304
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,660
Anyway...

305
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,390
Come back with us to the headquarters.

306
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,240
Huh?

307
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,570
But I was fired...

308
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,760
Now's not the time to be saying that.

309
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
Come on, quickly...

310
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Vice-Chief...

311
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,230
Come join Yamazaki...

312
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,300
Damn! They got away!

313
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,250
After them!!

314
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,360
Ow,ow,ow,ow,ow,ow. Mr. Sakata,

315
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,940
the shoulder portion of my denim
jacket is grinding into me!!

316
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,480
My arms feel like they're going to
rip off just like Guts from Berserk!!

317
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,720
[Note: Guts is the main character of Berserk,
a popular manga from Hakusensha.]

318
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
Shut up!! You be quiet!!

319
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,350
What was the meaning of that?!

320
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,450
Why is the Shinsengumi after Hijikata?!

321
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,690
Mr. Sakata!

322
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,800
Whoa, Miss Kagura. That was amazing!

323
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,240
[Note: Dr. Slump is a manga by Akira
Toriyama, author of Dragon Ball.]

324
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,280
This is like the return of Miss
Arale from Dr. Slump...

325
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,240
Shut up!! Someone shut this guy up!!

326
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,860
This is Third Squad. This is Third
Squad. Come in. Over.

327
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,820
Did you find Hijikata?

328
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,450
We found him, but we were no match
for his incredibly cute and strong ally.

329
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,490
Over, uh-huh.

330
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,310
"Uh-huh"?

331
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,420
Do whatever it takes to kill him.

332
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,970
Even if we kill Kondo, it'll be
meaningless if Hijikata's still around.

333
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,370
Get rid of all the dangerous elements
before we assassinate Kondo.

334
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,540
Once Kondo and Hijikata are both gone,

335
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,630
the entire Shinsengumi will become
faithful to the Ito faction.

336
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,360
They're planning to assassinate
Kondo-san and Hijikata-san?!

337
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,630
Don't let any other squad members
aside from us find out.

338
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,930
Make it look as if Anti-Foreigner
Faction members did it.

339
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,870
If Ito-san's plan is exposed at this stage,
the Shinsengumi will be split in two.

340
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,640
Kondo's assassination
looks to be a success.

341
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,490
Right now, he's on a train
heading to an expedition

342
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,660
to recruit squad members,
just as Ito-san planned.

343
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,340
All of the squad members
with him are allied with us.

344
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,680
He's by himself...

345
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,430
Kondo is

346
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,270
going to hell.

347
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,940
[Note: Also known as Musashi Province. Today, it
comprises of Tokyo, Saitama and part of Kanagawa.]

348
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,210
It's been a while since I've
gone back to Bushu.

349
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,940
That's where Toshi, Sogo and I grew up.

350
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,480
It was a rough place where
there were always fights.

351
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,440
Come to think of it, it's no different
from what we're doing now.

352
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,100
Sometimes I get anxious.

353
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,270
I could have been a better
guy back then.

354
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,360
I could have advanced a little.

355
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,840
You're a wonderful samurai.

356
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,690
I've never met a person
more honest than you.

357
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,910
I suppose I could call you immaculate.

358
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,200
You're like a white cloth.

359
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,670
You accept anything and
are colored by all colors.

360
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,600
The Shinsengumi

361
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,380
is a flag made of a white cloth onto which
everyone may project his colors.

362
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,290
In comparison, my color is black.

363
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,700
I'm not colored by anything,
and I turn everything black.

364
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,480
Only black remains, no matter where I go.

365
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,710
Everywhere I go becomes my color.

366
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,790
Kondo-san, I'm sorry.

367
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,480
Your flag has become pitch black.

368
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,300
As expected, Sensei.

369
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,550
You say interesting things.

370
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,920
We've become pitch black?

371
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,810
I see. That would be true
if I were a white cloth.

372
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,920
But I'm...

373
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,050
a loincloth that's full of frizzy hair. A white flag?

374
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm not that naïve.

375
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,570
I don't know about those around
you, but they're different.

376
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,660
They can't be called a color.

377
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,530
If anything, they're grime.

378
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,310
They're stains that you can't remove,
no matter how much you wash.

379
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,230
They're persistent and can't
be removed by washing.

380
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,320
I ended up becoming attached
to them. It's a real bother.

381
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:50,210
But the stains began to gather, and as
time passed, they became visible.

382
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,740
Before I knew it, they'd become
a splendid flag.

383
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,850
They're uneducated and have no ideals.

384
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,960
They act according to emotion
more than logic.

385
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,130
I don't often know what they're thinking.

386
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,790
They're mysterious guys.

387
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,560
Sensei, you...

388
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,210
can't control them.

389
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,390
They can't be colored or
affected by anything.

390
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,990
Okita-kun, what are you doing?

391
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,560
You're supposed to be keeping watch.

392
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,430
What are you doing?

393
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,860
I'm asking you what you're
doing, you piece of shit.

394
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,250
Okita-kun...

395
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,900
How dare you talk like that to Ito Sensei?!

396
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,460
Let go.

397
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,700
I said, let go of him!!

398
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,080

400
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,440
Hijikata-san!! Get a hold
of yourself, Hijikata-san!!

401
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,160
It's none of my concern...
It's of no concern...

402
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,510
At this rate, you may lose all the
people and things you hold dear!!
