Come on! Get up! Breakfast is ready!

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,900
Leave me alone. I don't want breakfast.

Don't be silly! Breakfast gives your brain energy for the whole day!

00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,680
W-Wait...really, gimme a break. I have a hangover.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,870
You shouldn't drink so much at your age. Pull yourself together!

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,540
What's with all the noise so early in the morning?

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,630
Good grief! You've got too much sleep in your eyes, girl. Go wash your face.

12

Shut up. I don't take orders from anyone.

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,770
Then you leave me no choice. Come on, turn this way.

There, all better. Girls have to keep themselves clean.

You're such hopeless kids.

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,260
How much rice? A large serving? Medium?

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,400
Okay, medium.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,270
What's the matter with you?! You're too thin!

20

Boys are healthy when they're just a bit chubby!

21
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,720
Then don't ask me in the first place. Quit nagging me.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,580
Don't talk back!

23

You're always trying to trip me up!

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,190
Good morning.

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,770
Huh? Something smells good.

Oh, 'morning.

You have to look after living creatures until they die, you know!

30

Oh, I'm sorry.

31

Never mind. Eat quickly.

32

Uh...okay...

33

How much rice? Medium? Large?

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,560
No, thank you. I already ate.

35

What're you talking about?

36
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,990
You wear glasses! Your eyes are bad because you don't eat enough!

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,520
No, I don't think glasses have anything to do with it.

38

Don't talk back! You're always trying to trip me up!

39

Don't leave anything in your bowls!

40
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,570
I'll go put out the garbage.

No, no. I have no family. She's yours, right? I appreciate it.

Who the heck is Hachiro?

59

More importantly, why is Hachiro's mother acting like our mother?

60
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,190
Out in the country where I come from, a mother is everyone's mother

61

and a child is everyone's child.

I came here from the country to see my son.

Is that a button? That thing above your eyebrows.

77

Is that a self-destruct button? If I push it, will you disappear?

This is my son Hachiro.

If it's a job, we'll take it.

But lady, you do have money, right?

83
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,170
I was keeping this for Hachiro to eat, but I guess I have no choice.

84

Hey lady, is this how you show your sincerity?

85
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,470
I see...so that's how it is, huh? Corrupt, that's what this Edo megalopolis is.

86
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,610
I get it. Suit yourself. But let me say one thing.

You'll never get true love from me!!

His name's Hachiro Kuroita.

Here in Kabukicho, names don't mean a thing.

95
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,610
There are a lot of guys living here who've discarded their name and their past.

96
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,910
Just a minute, madam.

97
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,660
Are you suggesting that my son is doing something fishy?

98
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,580
No, no. I only said there's a lot of people like that in this town.

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,590
No way! Hachiro isn't like that!

100
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,560
From the time he was little, that boy was smart, earnest and a devoted son.

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,330
I have always been so proud of him!

102
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,950
Five years ago, he came out to Edo by himself because his father suddenly died

103
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,690
and he wanted to help our poor family.

104
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,980
That boy...

105
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,070
...would never...

106
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,690
...become a treasure hunter.

107
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,180
How is that smart?!

108
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,000
No! I'm sure what my boy really meant was that

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,950
he was going to hunt for the treasure called "happiness"!

110
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,470
Anyway, that boy...

111
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,240
is working an honest job, I'm sure of it!

112
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,470
He's working diligently, as hard as he can, with everything he's got, in a corner of this greedy town!

113
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,600
Please, I'm begging you!

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,280
Take me to him!

115
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,050
I just want to see him, and ask him, "Are you doing okay?"

You're not thinking...?

Even if we found out anything more, Hachiro-san might not like it.

Maybe it's better if his mother didn't know anything.

138

That's not for us to decide. At any rate, we'll discuss it after we find her son.

Plastic surgery doesn't change the facial bone structure much, right?

Surgically altered beauties all have the same sort of look.

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,910
This isn't plastic surgery! You just added hair!

159
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,280
Let's just give up! Let's quit!

160
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,380
Let's quit this job!

161
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,560
Wassup. This is Hachiro.

162
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,530
Okay, got it.

163
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,690
I'm on my way to meet you now.

164
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
He... He does exist!

165
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,430
Is this for real? There he is!

166
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,310
Wh-What'll we do? What should we do?!

167
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,300
Calm down!

168
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,940
For now, call the old hag! Call her over here!

169
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,010
Mom!

170
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,810
Huh? What's she doing? Huh...

171
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,550
She's staring down those gals.

172
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,160
Old lady!

173
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I'll take care of it. You follow Hachiro!

174
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,120
Right!

175
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,120
What's with you, old hag? You're like seriously pissing me off.

176
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,360
You're like staring at me. And you're too close to me.

177
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,500
You make me like totally sick.

178
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Ambulance!

179
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,070
Somebody! Call an ambulance right now!

180
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,070
What're you screaming that for? What's the big idea?!

181
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,120
These girls have turned brown and they're complaining of nausea!

182
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,980
You're the one who's sick, old lady! You're seriously pissing me off!

183
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,230
Hey, Mom, hurry over here.

184
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,080
Sorry. She's from the country, so give her a break.

185
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,610
Stop that, Gin-san. Look at those girls' faces!

186
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,640
That's the same complexion my husband had before he died!

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,090
Oh yeah, that. They were born in a manure pool.

188
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,930
What's that supposed to mean, you?!

189
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,870
Just that. I'm busy, so go back to your manure pool.

190
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,040
Hold up. Hold up. What's going on?

191
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,100
Osaki-chan, is there trouble?

192
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,900
Kankichi-san!

193
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,970
This lame mother and son are giving us a hard time.

194
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,980
C'mon, who are these two? Country hicks?

195
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,520
I don't know what mountain you two came down from,

196
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,120
but if you press your luck around here, I'll kill you. I mean it.

197
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,150
Gin-san.

198
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,090
There...that man...

199
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,260
He's got short legs.

200
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,830
It's the fashion!

201
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,070
I'm sorry. She's from the country, so give her a break.

202
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,070
We're busy, so we'll be going now.

203
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,910
Hey, stop doing that.

204
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,160
That's a fashion trick to take your eyes off his short legs.

205
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,940
You're the rudest of all!

206
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,470
Hey, hold it!

207
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,140
If you keep screwing around like that, I don't care if it's an old lady or what...

208
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,380
I'll show you no mercy.

209
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,450
Hey, I said I was busy. Didn't you hear me, boys?

210
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,890
I don't give a darn about you wearing your toed socks or skirts loose,

211
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,120
but don't raise your hand to an old lady!

212
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,890
Wear your toed socks loose,

213
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,160
but do the right thing!

214
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,450
Pull up your pants, dummies!

215
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,770
Pull up your toed socks!

216
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,770
Learn from Sho Bro! Learn from his role on "Death Match"!

217
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:08,800
[Note: Sho Bro is short for Aikawa Sho, a famous Japanese actor known for playing Yakuza Boss-type roles.]

218
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,800
That's enough!

219
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,550
Kankichi. What're you doing out here?

220
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,710
Ky...

221
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,920
Kyoshiro-san!

222
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,860
Who're you?

223
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,240
Ha-Hachiro?!

224
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,130
You nimwits!

225
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,650
You may be peons, but you're employees of our club

226
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,860
and you've smeared dirt on Kyoshiro-san's reputation!

227
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,020
You're fired! Don't ever step foot in Kabukicho again!

228
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,610
Huh? What? What's going on?

229
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,190
It's Kyoshiro-san and Hachiro-san!

230
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,070
So that's Kabukicho's top host, Kyoshiro Honjo?

231
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,290
He's cool, but don't you think he looks a little scary?

232
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,120
Host? Huh? What's a host?

233
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,090
That's what's great about him.

234
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,180
What is that guy? What's a host? Hey.

235
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,350
Uh, you know. The guy version of a hostess.

236
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,430
Only the few chosen handsome ones...

237
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,970
Host? Huh? What's a host?

238
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,490
Only the few chosen handsome ones...

239
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,870
Huh? Host?

240
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,010
He's...a host? A host?!

241
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,510
Her...

242
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,710
...son is a...

243
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,880
Host?!

244
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,490
I'm terribly sorry for the trouble my boys caused.

245
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,240
Were you injured?

246
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,220
No, I'm fine. This is nothing.

247
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,830
I would really like to make this up to you.

248
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,730
Won't you come to our club?

249
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,470
Club?

250
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,070
[Takamagahara]

251
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,740
Yes. This is our club: Takamagahara.

252
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,400
Okay, then why don't you bring us some Dom-Peri?

253
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,620
Yes, but Miss, I think juice would be more...

254
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,430
Mind not making me angry?

255
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,700
Don't call me Miss. Call me Your Highness, Queen.

256
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,630
I'm terribly sorry! Queen of Kabukicho!

257
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,370
It's laughable that a Kabukicho host doesn't even know how to treat a lady.

258
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,800
An older woman enjoys being treated like a younger woman,

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,950
but a very young woman should be treated like an adult.

260
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,780
That's common sense.

261
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,410
If I say bring Dom-Peri,

262
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,800
bringing a cup of milk without saying anything more would be the smart thing to do,

263
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,650
wouldn't you say?

264
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,700
Forgive me, Your Highness!

265
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,890
Bring a cup of milk!

266
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,510
What's bringing an actual cup of milk going to do?!

267
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,360
Do you think I'm the type of woman who would be satisfied with just milk?

268
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,140
I'm already an adult. I can already handle Koronamin C.

269
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,140
[Note: A play on the energy drink Oronamin C.]

270
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,230
I would have expected nothing less.

271
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,000
You can already drink Koronamin C.

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,650
My last boyfriend said kids shouldn't drink Koronamin C.

273
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,070
He said even adults could only handle one bottle per day.

274
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,380
I wonder what he's doing these days...?

275
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Oh, I already finished two bottles...

276
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,080
So this is what a host club is like.

277
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,100
I feel really uncomfortable...

278
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,390
I know, it feels like this is no place for a man to be.

279
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,040
Well, whatever, we're here for the free drinks anyway.

280
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,860
You'd better not drink anything. I'll let you have anything up to a Koronamin C.

281
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,970
How dare you!

282
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,120
You touched me! This boy just touched me!

283
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,070
No, I didn't. I only poured your drink.

284
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,670
No, you touched me. You touched my breasts with your elbow.

285
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,010
And you... You've been glancing at me with that lecherous stare!

286
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,590
No, I haven't been looking.

287
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,800
Yes you were! At my body! That's harassment-

288
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,390
sexual harassment!

289
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,450
Hey, old lady, shut up! Your face is sexual harassment.

290
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,930
I've had enough. Gin-san, what is this place?!

291
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,680
Didn't we come here to find Hachiro?! Are you saying he's at a place like this?!

292
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,530
Now, now, calm down.

293
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,950
You guys can go. We'll drink by ourselves.

294
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,440
Gin-san.

295
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,310
Seems she still hasn't realized it yet.

296
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,910
That's obvious.

297
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,620
He's changed so much-even if he really is her son...

298
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,170
Hachiro is a common name.

299
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:11,270
I understand why it'd be so hard to speak out given how much he's changed...

300
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,560
But then why did he go out of his way to invite us here in the first place?

301
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,180
Human beings aren't about what's logical.

302
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,060
Even if your mother is annoying,

303
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,240
if you see her being attacked right in front of you, isn't it a son's instinct to help her?

304
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,100
Attacked? I'd say you were the ones doing the attacking.

305
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,650
Excuse me.

306
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,020
Is everyone enjoying themselves?

307
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,280
Kyoshiro-san.

308
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,890
It doesn't feel right to be served drinks by guys.

309
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,990
I'm sorry. This is a host club, so this is the best we can do.

310
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,450
Would you like something to eat?

311
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,270
Okay, then I'll have this cavia...

312
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,450
We don't need anything like that. I brought something from home.

313
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,690
Boiled beans! Eat as many as your age, okay?

314
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,980
You brought that in here?!

315
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't do that! It reeks of poverty!

316
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,050
These beans will cure that angry disposition!

317
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,140
You with the flashy clothes, try some, too!

318
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,660
Huh? Uh...all right.

319
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,410
Kyoshiro-san, there's something I'd like to ask you.

320
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,110
Huh? What is it?

321
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,510
You're also the owner of this club, aren't you, Kyoshiro-san?

322
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,410
Yes...

323
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,610
That guy with the humongous afro...

324
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,280
When did he start working at this club?

325
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,910
You mean Hachiro?

326
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,840
He's a close friend of mine who's been with me since we started this club.

327
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,300
I used to work at another club, but two years ago,

328
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,670
the two of us decided to start our own club.

329
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,380
He also used to be a host, but now he works behind the scenes.

330
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,010
He had a slight mishap with plastic surgery.

331
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,880
A mishap with plastic surgery? What sort of mishap?

332
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,040
Did the operating room blow up or something?

333
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,350
Um...is what happened this afternoon part of Hachiro-san's job, as well?

334
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,110
Well...yes... He does some bodyguard duties...

335
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,510
This is a dangerous town, so he sometimes does that sort of thing...

336
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,540
To make it...

337
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,760
to the top in this town, you need more than just appearances.

338
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,220
I've become known as the top host in Kabukicho,

339
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,800
but I've lost more than I've gained.

340
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,820
It's embarrassing to say this, but...

341
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,470
We're all people who cannot look our parents in the eyes.

342
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,220
[Note: Aniki refers to Big Brother or Boss]

343
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,220
Aniki!

344
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,530
Found him. This guy is Hachiro.

345
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,980
That so? Then we'll bring him back with us.

346
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,580
I don't want to trouble the club or its guests.

347
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,690
Hachiro!

348
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,630
Hey, who are those guys?

349
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,920
I'm terribly sorry for the commotion.

350
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,390
Don't pay any mind to us, everyone. Please continue what you were doing.

351
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,070
Too bad, they're all running away.

352
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,040
Sorry about that, Kyoshiro-han. Please don't report us for obstructing business.

353
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,450
Katsuo-san, you again?

354
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,620
Please let Hachiro go. Stop this harassment.

355
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,540
That's not what we're doing at all.

356
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm not here about such a small matter, Kyoshiro-han.

357
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,250
I'm tired of having to come out here to deal with incidents like the other day.

358
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,450
My dachshund is about to give birth. I want to be there when she does.

359
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,760
I really don't have time to get involved in a childish fight.

360
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,270
A childish fight?

361
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,170
Yeah...

362
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,720
Your bodyguard beat up a kid on the street.

363
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,370
Hosts nowadays sure are impolite!

364
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,660
That was one of the young ones.

365
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,610
He did something stupid, so we taught him a lesson. It has nothing to do with you.

366
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,390
But it does.

367
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,990
Right, Kanshichi-kun?

368
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,300
No. It's Kankichi.

369
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,090
Kanpachi-kun here is a relative of our big boss.

370
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,590
So we need to settle this our way.

371
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,940
The Big Boss's?

372
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,730
I don't know. Might be a very distant relative.

373
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,630
I hear he's a relative of a relative of a relative of a relative.

374
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,610
Stop making false accusations.

375
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,300
It's not a false accusation.

376
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,910
Right, Kankuro-san?

377
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,710
Y-Yes. I'm a relative of a relative of a relative.

378
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,270
You're missing one relative!

379
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,610
He's mistaken.

380
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,920
He's a relative of a relative of a relative of a relative of a relative of my big boss.

381
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,220
Boss, that's one relative too many.

382
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,820
Never mind.

383
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,200
What I'm trying to say is that

384
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,400
all human beings are relatives born from the maternal ocean.

385
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Gin-san, who are these people?

386
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,080
That's probably Katsuo the Black Piece of the Gutter Rat Gang.

387
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,500
He's a junior boss of one of the four kings of Kabukicho, Jirocho Doromizu.

388
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,010
What's the deal behind the club's dispute with such a troublesome fellow?

389
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,010
Money. It's money. I heard those liars mention it earlier.

390
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,600
The Gutter Rat Gang's been demanding money to take over the protection gig.

391
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,520
After Kyoshiro-san turned them down, they've been harassing the club.

392
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,260
Man, from one thing to the next, that son is a handful. Isn't he, Mom?

393
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,830
Huh? Where's the old lady?

394
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,150
Now that you mention it, she's gone.

395
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,840
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

396
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,420
He's covered with blood!

397
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,080
Who's the old lady?

398
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,120
Just a minute! Just a minute!

399
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,840
Hey, umm! Just a minute! Just a minute!

400
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,840
What're you talking about?

401
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,980
Rice crackers and peanuts go well with drinks, but you mustn't eat too much.

402
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,490
No one bleeds this much from eating too many peanuts!

403
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,080
I told you to eat six parts rice crackers to four parts peanuts!

404
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,330
That's enough, old lady. Don't try to make fools of us.

405
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,820
Everyone knows the ratio of rice crackers to peanuts...

406
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,210
is seven to three!

407
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,610
Everything in this world works out if divided by seven to three!

408
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,830
7:3. It's the Golden Ratio that forms the basis for the entire Universe. You idiot!

409
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,930
You're only saying 7:3 because you want to eat more rice crackers!

410
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,570
Read the "Monkey vs. Crab" for the rest of your life. You idiot!

411
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,570
Stupid!

412
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,300
This ratio is the Golden Ratio that enhances both the rice crackers and peanuts.

413
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,280
You ugly idiot!

414
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,490
You're just infatuated with the words "Golden Ratio."

415
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,400
Why don't you forget about reason and live tomorrow like you were dead? You idiot!

416
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,690
Fine, old lady. Tonight, we'll debate rice crackers and peanuts till dawn.

417
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,060
Let's settle it once and for all!

418
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,560
Boss, what did we come here for?

419
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,280
How would I know, stupid?!

420
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,270
Hey, you guys. Don't just stand there...

421
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,640
Hurry up and bring us drinks!

422

What's wrong with this place?

You're a host club, yet you don't know how to serve your customers?
