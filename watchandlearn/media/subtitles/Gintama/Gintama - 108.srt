00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,000
Who...are you?

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,140
Where's Utsuzo?

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,610
He's not here.

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,010
He left this world a long time ago.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,010
What?!

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,050
Was it you?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,540
I'm asking you if you're the
one who killed Utsuzo.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,430
The foolish son won't come
out even though Boss dies.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,240
The gang will need someone
to take his place, right?

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,190
That's right. You can't have the
unreliable heir take over.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,710
You need someone with sharp
skills and a sharp mind.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,200
A real yakuza.

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,100
Find him!

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,400
Drag the river if you have to, but find him!

16
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,610
[Utsuzo, who had supposedly locked himself
inside the storehouse, is no longer alive.]

17
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,080
[Kyojiro Nakamura, the Mashiroi Gang's junior boss, was next in line. What secret from the past did this man people called Guardian Dog know?]

18
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,820
Who could have imagined that
Kyojiro would be in charge...

19
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,400
of Boss Mashiroi's funeral ceremony.

20
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,150
The one they call Guardian Dog.

21
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,500
The Boss had only one son, I believe.

22
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,210
I hear they butted heads a lot over
him wanting to live an honest life.

23
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,560
They say he ran away from home
and no one knows where he is.

24
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,710
Rumor has it that Kyojiro killed him.

25
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,010
Who knows what really happened.

26
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,530
Before the Boss took him in...

27
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,790
he lived like a stray dog.

28
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,540
Hey, he might bite you in the throat

29
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,680
if he hears you spreading
rumors like that.

30
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,850
How frightening.

31
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:47,270
["Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid"]

32
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,990
We're asking you where Gin-san went!

33
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,490
I don't know what to tell you...

34
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,170
He hasn't returned since that night.
If you know anything, please tell us!

35
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,800
I don't know anything...

36
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,460
Dammit, you! If you're monkeying around
with us, I'll rip out your hair!

37
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,680
Kagura-chan, think a little before you
speak. These are scary people.

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,330
You're a spunky young lady.

39
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,200
But I don't know anything.

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,070
And even if I did, I probably
wouldn't tell you anything.

41
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,470
We're not getting anywhere with
you. Call Nakamura-san!

42
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,520
Right! We don't want
to deal with small fries!

43
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,900
Do you people understand
what's going on here?

44
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,170
Brother doesn't have the time
to be bothered by you.

45
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,310
Go on home.

46
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,760
That's enough.

47
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,100
Come this way. I'll hear
what you have to say.

48
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,040
So you're saying that when he learned
the Boss died, he left right away?

49
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,240
That's right. His client died.

50
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,860
It's what anyone would do.

51
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,740
Something's odd...

52
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,460
What do you mean?

53
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,740
It's not odd that Gin-san
didn't come back,

54
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,800
but I can't imagine Gin-san giving up
on the job for a reason like that.

55
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,720
The Boss's words were full of sincerity

56
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,660
when he said he wanted to confront
his son face-to-face.

57
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,020
That's why Gin-san accepted this
job. I'm sure that's how it was.

58
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,080
He commands a great deal
of faith...that man does.

59
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,460
Well, most of his life is
about slacking, but...

60
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,230
That's right! Most of his body is made
up of sugar and useless syrup,

61
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,160
but Gin-chan would never
give up halfway on a job!

62
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,460
Tell me something.

63
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,490
What is that man to you?

64
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,850
He's like family.

65
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,840
Family, huh?

66
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,610
Nakamura-san...you know
something, don't you?

67
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,170
Let me tell you one thing...

68
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,290
Nothing good happens when decent
people stick their noses

69
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,580
into yakuza business with
a half-hearted resolve.

70
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,660
That's a warning to you.

71
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,960
[Shutenkaku]

72
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,440
You all know why I called this meeting.

73
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,860
I wanted to discuss the
Mashiroi Gang situation.

74
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,430
About a successor...?

75
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,370
Wasn't there a spirited guy there...

76
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,770
What was his name now?

77
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,940
Kyojiro Nakamura, the Mashiroi
Gang's junior boss.

78
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,720
They call him Guardian Dog Kyojiro.

79
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,490
Guardian Dog? Are you kidding?
He's more like a mad dog.

80
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,850
He's sharp and he's got balls. But...

81
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,650
It's just a rumor, but...

82
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,030
However, we do have to
decide on a successor.

83
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,540
But we have to set an example
for the other gangs.

84
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,030
Okay, it's unanimous. Is that okay?

85
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,150
Brother!

86
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,910
Brother.

87
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,750
There's a letter for you.

88
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,300
It's from the organization bosses.

89
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,510
It's been decided.

90
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,390
What?

91
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,110
The date for the inauguration
ceremony's been set.

92
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,100
Then...

93
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,100
Yes, they've officially decided
that I am the successor.

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,980
But I'm worried...

95
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,840
About what?

96
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,470
That rumor's been going around.
Will everything be okay?

97
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,350
It's the truth, so there's nothing
we can do about it.

98
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,160
Let people talk.

99
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,590
But Brother...

100
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,020
That's enough! Leave
me alone for a while.

101
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,810
There he is!

102
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,840
Over there!

103
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,870
To survive, I did anything
I had to...except kill.

104
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,880
Anything to survive that day...

105
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,000
Everyone despised, detested
and feared me...

106
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,370
Boss! This is the brat who's
been raiding our turf!

107
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,730
Around here, he's known
as Guardian Dog Kyojiro,

108
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,070
a brat so well known that even adults
make way to let him pass.

109
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,640
He's a street urchin with no
parents and no home.

110
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,980
No one's going to complain-hey,

111
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,950
they might even thank us-if we wrapped
him up and dumped him in the river.

112
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,620
Guardian Dog.

113
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,570
He certainly does look
like a Guardian Dog

114
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,140
with those scowl lines between
his eyebrows.

115
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,260
You can't form lines like those
without going through a lot.

116
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,760
You've suffered a lot, haven't you, kid?

117
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,800
That settles it. I'm taking this dog.

118
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,410
I want to see him lose those scowl lines!

119
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,320
There was no enmity or insult.

120
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,760
The first adult who ever smiled at
me was a bigger villain that I was.

121
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,050
Utsuzo, come here.

122
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,210
Come...

123
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,480
From today on, this is
your friend, Kyojiro.

124
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,500
Kyojiro?

125
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,400
Kyojiro, this is my son, Utsuzo.
He's a yakuza's kid,

126
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,280
but he's a weakling. Look
after him for me.

127
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,220
From that day on, the stray dog...

128
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,730
became a Guardian Dog.

129
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,250
For someone like me,

130
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,800
unwanted and hated by everyone,

131
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,070
to be needed by someone
made me happy.

132
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,210
I didn't mind being a guard
dog. That's how I felt.

133
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,450
What?! Utsuzo was attacked
by the Zannenbi Gang?!

134
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,370
Utsuzo!

Kyojiro!

139
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,090
Boss was more worried

140
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,940
about my injuries than about his
own son...his tears felt warm.

141
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,980
The person who taught me-

142
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,710
someone with no family-what
it meant to be family was...

143
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,730
you, Dad.

144
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,360
[Inauguration Ceremony]

145
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,850
Dad, I made up my mind that day.

146
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,630
Your blood may not run
through my veins.

147
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,800
But I will shed my blood at the same time

148
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,210
and for the same things that you do.

149
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,310
...Yes, that's what I've decided.

150
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,340
That's what I decided, but...

151
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,050
Let's not all be so formal. Drink up.

152
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,530
Only those who work can
enjoy the taste of sake.

153
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,940
Of course the work you do
is probably only crime.

154
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,760
Yo! Is this a birthday party?
Happy birthday.

155
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,550
You're...?!

156
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,760
I thought we were friends?

157
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,100
You could've at least invited
me to your party.

158
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,240
I intend to repay you in full for the present
you gave me the other day.

159
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,770
I've been in this business a long time
and met a lot of strong guys.

160
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,030
But I've never met a guy who returned after
getting slashed and shot up like you.

161
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,680
I'm glad you're not a yakuza.

162
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,960
You put on quite a show here.

163
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,710
Those guys are the bosses
of our organization.

164
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,670
You'll never get out of here alive.

165
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,100
Is that so?

166
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,180
Was it because of the Boss?

167
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,230
You intend to take on the
entire organization

168
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,290
just for the sake of a yakuza
you only met once?

169
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,210
Yakuza or not, it doesn't matter.

170
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,290
Lawless fellows like you and me

171
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,450
have nowhere to go once we've
lost our honor and humanity.

172
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,530
You're exactly right.

173
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,130
I may've sunk low, but I'm still a yakuza.

174
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,620
I can't survive in this business if
I've lost my honor and humanity.

175
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,420
They're not my guys. It would appear...

176
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,250
the inauguration ceremony
was just a pretense.

177
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,200
Rumors of my actions have gotten around
inside and outside my own gang.

178
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
The association never had any intention
of allowing me to succeed the Boss.

179
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,230
They were after my life.

180
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,620
Kill me.

181
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,430
It'll be payback for blowing
a hole in your belly.

182
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,390
I'll let you take my life.

183
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,870
Having a guy like you take my
life rather than those guys

184
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,810
would give me something to boast
about in the other world.

185
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,970
You came here knowing what
would happen, didn't you?

186
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,190
You came here to die, didn't you?

187
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,990
Honor and humanity?

188
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,450
I'd forgotten those words
a long time ago.

189
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,260
I have nothing left to protect.

190
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,780
Nothing...

191
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,730
What? I dare you to say that again!

192
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,480
Calm down, Boss!

193
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,250
I'll repeat it as many times as you want!

194
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,610
I don't want to live with you
and your men, Father!

195
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,960
If it's a successor you want, there's
someone much more suitable!

196
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,010
I'll live the way I want to live!

197
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,190
Wait! Utsuzo!

198
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,420
Father, you have Kyojiro-san!
He's got guts, brains and strength!

199
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
He's a much more decent son than me!

200
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,020
Stupid fool!

201
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,350
Boss!

202
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,650
Young Boss!

203
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,110
Young Boss!

204
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,790
Young Boss! Come on out!

205
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,860
Young Boss!

206
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,670
Young Boss!

207
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,350
This is so stupid...

208
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,340
Having him succeed me...

209
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,210
Maybe I thought that was the way
to show my love for my son.

210
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,170
Laugh at me, Kyojiro.

211
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,440
My arms may be good at hitting
and threatening people,

212
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,050
but they don't even know
how to hug their own son.

213
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,960
Young Boss...

214
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,320
Listen up...

215
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,900
Don't let the Boss near the storehouse.

216
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,350
Boss will die soon.

217
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,640
Until then, take turns living
in the storehouse

218
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,300
and don't let him know that the
Young Boss is not there.

219
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,540
Understand?

220
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,320
Brother...where is...the Young Boss?

221
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,170
Young boss...

222
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,670
...I killed him.

223
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,580
This is...how it should be...

224
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,590
Boss died without knowing
anything. My duty is...

225
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,100
Fulfilled.

226
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,400
I have nothing left...to protect.

227
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,650
Wh-What...?! Are you...

228
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,130
doing?!

229
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,770
I already repaid you for the
hole you put in my gut!

230
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,290
Like I told you, I only came to fulfill my
obligation to honor and humanity.

231
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,810
I promised the old man, you know.

232
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,090
That I'd bring his foolish son to him.

233
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,300
So draw your sword! Fight!

234
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,600
You understand, right,

235
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,230
that I'm the guy who
tried to take your life!

236
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,300
That kind of thing wasn't going to kill me.

237
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,680
I was just going along with
your lousy playacting.

238
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,490
You...

239
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,270
I saw right through you.
You're a lousy actor!

240
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,850
Was it you?

241
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,450
I'm asking you if you're the
one who killed Utsuzo.

242
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,180
You would kill me and shoulder all the
blame to keep the secret hidden.

243
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,720
And what's more,

244
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,790
you were going to die and take
everything to your grave?

245
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,010
Stop trying to make yourself look good!

246
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,730
If you really think of the old
man as your father...

247
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,320
If you're really doing this for his sake...

248
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,440
Live. Bring even a single lousy flower
and go visit him at his grave!

249
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,180
I won't allow any more of the
old man's sons die!

250
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,430
I won't let you die!

251
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,140
I'll drag you to that old man's
grave if I have to!

252
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,810
Out of my way!

253
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,540
Scumbags!

254
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,980
Kyojiro!

255
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,790
Kyojiro!

256
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,210
Hang on! Hey!

257
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,250
Dammit! Wait I'll get a doctor!

258
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,620
Don't bother. It hit me in the worst spot.

259
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,670
Don't be so weak!

260
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,010
You're a yakuza, aren't you?!

261
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,040
Don't whimper just because
there's a hole in your gut!

262
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,950
This is...how it's supposed to be.

263
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,440
I...can't face the Boss.

264
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,520
I couldn't protect what
was precious to him.

265
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,990
It's divine punishment.

266
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:13,090
He helped me so much, but I couldn't
do a single thing for him in return.

267
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:20,120
I was a useless Guardian Dog.
Once a stray, always a stray.

268
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,220
When I die, throw my
body in a back alley.

269
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,730
It's a death befitting a stray dog.

270
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,680
You're not a stray dog.

271
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,050
The rest of the world might scorn
you, but I know the truth.

272
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,320
Even if you had to take all the blame,

273
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,380
you protected it until the very end.

274
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,160
You're not a stray dog.

275
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,680
You're a noble Guardian Dog.

276
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,510
Guardian Dog.

277
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,720
He certainly does look

278
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,690
like a Guardian Dog with those scowl
lines between his eyebrows.

279
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,040
You can't form lines like those
without going through a lot.

280
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,270
You've suffered a lot, haven't you, kid?

281
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,170
That settles it.

282
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:25,360
I'm taking this dog. I want to see
him lose those scowl lines!

283

[Preview]

284

A spy's most dangerous assignment
is the undercover investigation.

285
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,600
I will do anything in my power to approach
the Unstoppable Kotaro

Katsura and round up the
Anti-Foreigner Faction.

The next episode... "Life is a Test."

288
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,310
...You mean, there's a test for that?!
