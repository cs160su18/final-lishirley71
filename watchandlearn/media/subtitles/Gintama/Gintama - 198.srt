2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,260
I can no longer see...

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,950
Doman, it appears that I've
lost sight of myself again.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,870
I no longer have a need to watch over all!

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,090
I only want one thing...

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,880
I only want to see her smile...

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,330
That's all.

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,020
Come get me, Doman!

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,430
I shall show you the true power of the head
of the Ketsuno clan, Seimei Ketsuno!

10
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,000
["Never Losing That Smile"]

11
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,630
What incredible power!

12
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,700
Seimei has gathered the power
that was used to protect Edo!

13
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,470
Team Shirino's shikigami
was instantly eradicated!

14
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,020
Soan has lost his will
to fight and run away!

15
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,980
Only Doman remains!

16
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,810
Doman!

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,980
Seimei...

18
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,860
Seimei!

19
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,250
Rin, Pyo, To, Sha, Kai,
Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen!

20
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,530
Mystic counter!

21
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,570
Mantra of Victory!

22
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,790
Mystic seal!

23
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,230
Spell return!

24
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,220
A furious exchange of blows!

25
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,670
The arena is falling apart!

26
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,610
It's like we're watching Dragonball!

27
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,440
Seimei, I will not lose!

28
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,810
I will never lose!

29
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,220
It's futile, Doman.

30
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,870
Your power alone will not
be enough to defeat me!

31
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,290
namaH sarvatathaagatebhyaH
sarvamukhebhyaH, sarvathaa traT...

32
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,710
But Doman is already chanting
another spell!

33
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,690
You have a bad habit of getting so excited that
you lose sight of everything else, Doman.

34
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,120
I'm going to wake you up!

35
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,760
Silence!

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,850
Acala Vidyaraja!

37
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,910
Wow!

38
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,640
Doman is surrounded by
a swirl of flaming wards!

39
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,390
To cast so many wards simultaneously!

40
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,280
Such an amazing display of power!

41
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,590
Seimei...

42
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,720
I shall incinerate you with an
infinite number of flames!

43
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,350
Doman.

44
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,840
Don't make up numbers.

45
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,970
Rounding 103 wards wouldn't
give you an infinite number.

46
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,820
I should mention that I'm using 1,562.

47
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,570
Nowhere near infinity.

48
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,870
What an incredible number!

49
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,320
Seimei has surpassed Doman
by controlling an infinite...!

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,890
Correction, by controlling 1,562 wards!

51
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,250
It's almost like a giant wall of fire!

52
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,120
Seimei... You...

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,590
Doman, this is the difference
between our heart's wish!

54
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,880
Overwhelming!

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,420
Now that Seimei has unleashed
his true power,

56
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,030
Doman is unable to fight back!

57
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,190
Doman has been swallowed
in a giant flame to burn!

58
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,810
Is the match over?!

59
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,630
Doman...

60
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,270
Doman...

61
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,960
Doman, what are you doing?

62
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,600
You're so hopeless.

63
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
Staying up late again.

64
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,140
But I can't fall asleep.

65
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,540
Very well.

66
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,000
I shall tell you another old tale.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,280
Yay! What are you going
to tell me about today?

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
Kintaro slaying Gedomaru?

69
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,350
Or Momotaro?

70
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,050
No, I have an older story to tell you.

71
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,190
Long, long ago, an evil
god lived in the capital.

72
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:43,520
The brutal god, Antenmaru, shrouded
the capital in dark clouds

73
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,260
and tortured the people
with an eternal rain.

74
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:55,400
However, Antenmaru was sealed by the
mysterious power of two travelers.

75
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:02,640
The skies cleared above the capital and the emperor
showed his appreciation for the brothers

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,690
by granting the name Mikado, as protectors
of the capital, and made them his servants.

77
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,500
The Mikado brothers were very close,

78
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,770
and they were able to drive away
all forms of wickedness.

79
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:21,250
Their strong bond kept the capital safe.

80
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:28,870
But something happened to fracture their bond,
where demons had been unable to strike.

81
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:38,120
The younger Mikado brother was in love with
the emperor's sister, the lovely princess.

82
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,950
However, the princess lived in a different
world from the Mikado brothers.

83
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,430
The younger brother's love was
a sad one that could never be.

84
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,400
The younger brother kept his feelings
for the princess secret

85
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,640
as he could only watch
over her from afar.

86
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,210
That was when a shocking piece
of news reached his ears.

87
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,310
The princess had been kidnapped.

88
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,530
The kidnapper was...

89
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,130
His older brother.

90
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,170
Yes, the older brother was also
in love with the princess.

91
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:22,050
Sadly, they had fallen in love with each other
without the younger brother knowing

92
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,140
and eloped, abandoning their
position and prestige!

93
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,670
The emperor was absolutely furious

94
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,900
and declared that the older
brother be tried as a traitor.

95
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,170
And the younger brother was
chosen to track him down.

96
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,690
The younger brother set off on
his search with a heavy heart...

97
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,240
But his older brother was living
happily with the princess...

98
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,950
And when he saw their baby, his heart
was overcome with darkness.

99
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,490
The next thing he knew, the two of them
were on the ground before him.

100
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,420
The two people he loved most.

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:12,580
He spared the baby because he could not bear
for his heart to be blackened any further.

102
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,000
Once he returned to the capital, he was named
to a high position in the government.

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,940
But despite his prestige, despite his beautiful
wife, his heart remained clouded.

104
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,350
Rain continued to fall on the
capital, as it did in his heart.

105
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,450
And the younger brother finally realized.

106
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,210
That he was causing the rain...

107
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,490
That he had become a demon...

108
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,470
The darkness had spread from
his heart to the rest of his body,

109
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,400
transforming him into the evil god he
and his brother had once sealed,

110
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,970
Antenmaru!

111
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,410
Antenmaru had been biding his
time after they sealed him,

112
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,680
before possessing the younger brother through
his jealousy, hatred, and negative feelings,

113
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,980
all while plotting revenge.

114
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,820
However, it was too late
by the time he realized.

115
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,990
An arrow was fired into his hideous face.

116
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:26,500
There stood the son of his brother,
whose life he had spared.

117
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,990
And thus, the clouds which had
shrouded the capital cleared.

118
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,090
However, a new dark cloud was born.

119
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,500
The son of the older brother
slew the revived Antenmaru

120
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,690
and entered the Emperor's service,
founding the Ketsuno clan.

121
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,560
[Ketsuno]

122
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,630
And the children of the younger brother
who were chased from the capital

123
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,520
and had their name taken,
the Shirino clan.

124
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,520
[Shirino]

125
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,070
The holy gate, Mikado, which
had once guarded the capital,

126
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,270
was split in half like a dirty ass.

127
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,490
And thus began the long struggle
between Ketsuno and Shirino.

128
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,990
A spiral of growing hate...

129
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,680
How am I supposed to fall asleep
after hearing all that melodrama?!

130
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,000
Now listen, Doman.

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,050
No way!

132
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,150
You're going to tell me to
fight Seimei-kun again!

133
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,170
So it's true that you've become
friendly with the Ketsuno boy.

134
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,170
I don't care about the past!

135
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,820
Don't force your family feud onto us!

136
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,730
Seimei-kun's a really nice guy!

137
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,280
He taught me how to curse
my enemies today!

138
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,510
Once the two of us take over, the Ketsuno clan
and Shirino clan will get along together!

139
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,670
We made a promise!

140
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,570
You fool!

141
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,630
Can you not understand the grudge our ancestors hold
for having their position and prestige taken away?!

142
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,200
Get along together?

143
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,630
That will never happen!

144
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,820
If you have time to learn how to curse
your enemies from an enemy,

145
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,390
curse that boy to death.

146
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,100
If you don't end your
relationship with him,

147
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,990
our relationship as father
and son ends here.

148
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,620
What's that?!

149
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,070
The mystical mark on Doman-san...!

150
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
It's too bad.

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,170
I thought we could become best friends.

152
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,500
Hey, you hear?

153
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,710
Our young master was beaten
up by the Ketsuno kid again.

154
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,200
No chance there.

155
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,030
That kid's said to be the greatest prodigy
the Ketsuno clan has ever seen.

156
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,190
Adults can't even beat him,
and he's still young.

157
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,530
Man, what a terrifying kid.

158
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,650
Completely different from
our craven young master.

159
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,820
I have to worry about our future when
our next head is so pathetic.

160
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,490
Honestly, I envy the Ketsuno clan.

161
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,870
You fool!

162
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,030
You have the nerve to crawl
back to this house!

163
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,840
You have shamed our clan!

164
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,650
I told you not to return
until you defeated him!

165
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,400
Hate him!

166
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,450
Envy him!

167
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,700
Despise him!

168
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,170
We are armed with a millennia of malice!

169
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,290
Change that hatred into power!

170
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:29,470
Take everything back, even if it requires
you to become a demon!

171
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
Are you okay?

172
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,910
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,730
My brother doesn't know
how to hold back.

174
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,680
Oh no...

175
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,420
You're bleeding from your butt.

176
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,580
You can use mine.

177
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,910
Help one another when in need, right?

178
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,910
["Rorie"]
[Note: This is a play on "Laurier",
a woman's sanitary napkin brand.]

179
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,790
What is this?!

180
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,450
The writing on Doman's
face is spreading!

181
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,360
That's?!

182
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,570
Doman.

183
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,030
Surrender your body to me!

184
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,180
The ones who banished your family from
the light to the dark should be hated!

185
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,230
Should be destroyed!

186
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,080
Why do you hesitate? Why do you wait?

187
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,240
Surrender your body, just as it happened
a thousand years ago!

188
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,880
I'm sorry...

189
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,260
Today's that day...

190
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,950
Recall!

191
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,340
The magma of hatred
sleeping deep within!

192
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,990
Hey, Christel.

193
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,440
We're out of paper.

194
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,810
Okay, then I'll leave some out here.

195
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,880
That's all you ever have!

196
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,970
Never forgive the ones who
took everything from you!

197
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,850
If you can never have what you want,

198
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,370
destroy it all!

199
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,410
Soak into darkness!

200
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,970
Doman...

201
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,220
Did you channel yourself
into a shikigami?

202
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,600
No.

203
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,110
That is not a mere shikigami.

204
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,260
Lord Seimei, that man...

205
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,310
Has allowed his hatred to drive him
into summoning something terrible.

206
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,960
Don't tell me that's...?!

207
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,800
The most evil of gods, sealed by
the Ketsuno and Shirino clans

208
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,790
a thousand years ago
after a desperate fight.

209
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,390
Antenmaru.

210
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,350
Antenmaru, you say?!

211
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,900
The demon who almost destroyed
the capital a thousand years ago...

212
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,780
The strongest of the wrathful gods which
was sealed by our predecessors,

213
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,740
the Mikado, after many battles...

214
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,740
Why is it here?!

215
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,290
It was revived.

216
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,750
That man was driven by negative
feelings to seek power

217
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,130
and dabbled in the forbidden arts.

218
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:50,300
He's awakened the slumbering Antenmaru
and given his own body.

219
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,270
Turn his own body over to a demon...

220
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,510
How could he do this?

221
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,360
You intend to repeat the tragedy from
a thousand years ago, Doman?!

222
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,910
Lord Doman! Get a hold of yourself!

223
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,340
What's going on?!

224
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,500
No! He can no longer differentiate
between friend and foe!

225
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,030
Everyone run!

226
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,010
Wake up! Doman!

227
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,030
My spells don't work!

228
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,070
Lord Seimei!

229
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,610
Shinpachi! We don't have
time to worry about rules!

230
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,140
Darkness...

231
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,030
Overwhelming darkness capable of even
swallowing Lord Seimei's spells...

232
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,530
It consumes Doman's negative
feelings to grow stronger.

233
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,880
It can no longer be stopped...

234
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,070
It won't stop until it has shrouded
everything in darkness!

235
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,050
Lord Seimei!

236
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,840
Stay back!

237
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,330
Gedomaru! Kuzunoha!

238
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,470
Take that man and his
friends and escape!

239
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,280
Lord Seimei!

240
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,260
Gedomaru?!

241
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,100
It's too early to give up.

242
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,610
This man has yet to play his role.

243
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,910
What are you saying?!

244
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,700
Continue treating him.

245
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,590
His right ball is more or less healed.

246
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,350
Lord Seimei wasn't able to
stand against that thing!

247
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,220
What could this man with
no balls possibly do?!

248
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,450
It's true that he has no balls...

249
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,370
But this man...

250
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:58,590
...has a soul that can never be crushed.

251
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,210
What are you doing?!

252
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,610
Don't push yourself!

253
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,270
Your left ball is still crushed!

254
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,830
It's just as she said, I'm good to go...

255
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,880
Help keep my balance...

256
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:23,430
Speaking of which,
it's time for me to use this baby.

257
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,330
Got a rendezvous with a demon.

258
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,870
Spruce it up a bit.

259
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,410
Something flashy enough
to stick up its dirty ass!

260
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,350
What are you doing?!

261
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,220
There isn't time to worry about
which side you're on!

262
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,450
At this rate, the Ketsuno clan, Shirino
clan, and all of Edo will be wiped out!

263
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,730
Help him out!

264
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,940
You may have had your differences,
but you were all trying to protect Edo!

265
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,050
Didn't I tell you to escape?!

266
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,350
Sister lover!

267
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,010
Hold on!

268
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,110
We're coming to help!

269
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,760
This is the fate of those born
to Ketsuno and Shirino.

270
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:13,500
We may struggle, but we cannot
escape a millennia of karma.

271
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,260
Our ancestors destroyed one
another over a woman.

272
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,460
Our ancestors took from yours,
and threw you into the darkness...

273
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,820
And I have repeated that mistake.

274
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,000
However, Doman...

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,350
I can not allow a woman to
die because of our fight!

276
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,240
And Doman...

277
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,570
I won't let you die!

278
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:46,080
I am the only one who needs to die.

279
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,580
Doman, I knew that you
had fallen for Christel.

280
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,880
That you were suffering from the mess
created by your feelings for her,

281
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,870
animosity toward me, pressure
from your clan, and whatnot.

282
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,290
I thought I could ease your suffering...

283
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:11,330
A time would come where the three of us could
laugh together, that's what I thought...

284
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:18,150
But in the end, I only hurt
Christel and you...

285
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,930
Fate is beyond our control, Doman.

286
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,610
I may know a thousand different spells,

287
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,780
but I don't know a single way
to make up with a friend.

288
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,570
I was the one who pushed
you into that state.

289
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,880
It is my duty to take it all in.

290
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,520
Throw me all your hatred, sadness...

291
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,830
I'll accept all of your darkness.

292
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:59,670
My life would be a cheap price to pay to
end this stupid thousand-year-long fight...

293
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,090
Let's end this, Doman.

294
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:09,980
You must not lose yourself like your
ancestor and attempt to destroy all!

295
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,900
Come back to us, Doman!

296
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,410
Remember!

297
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,130
Was the woman you loved meant to
stand in the rain under a dark sky?

298
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,040
Was the Christel you loved...?

299
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,630
The Christel we loved...?

300
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,340
Seimei-san!

301
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,270
Descendant of Mikado.

302
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,030
It is too late.

303
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,860
Your voices cannot reach him,
now that I have swallowed him.

304
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,330
I laugh that a weakling consumed by darkness
would ever think to control my power.

305
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:53,450
However, his negative
feelings served useful.

306
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,300
I'll gladly be taking them.

307
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:02,620
And thus, Ketsuno and Shirino, the two despicable
Mikado bloodlines, have been destroyed.

308
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:08,320
However, my thousand-year-long
curse will not end!

309
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,660
I will not allow a single
drop of Mikado blood,

310
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,490
responsible for sealing me,
to exist in this land!

311
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,400
What?!

312
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,650
Who are you...?!

313
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Just a fan.
