[Ebina-san lived in the pond. He kept his promise forever.]

00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,080
[The evil land shark Ibaraki family plots to turn the pond into a golf course.]

00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,080
["If You're a Man, Try the Swordfish!"]

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,290
Hooked one!

6
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,980
Oh! It's definitely a big one.

7
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,290
You're not getting away.

8
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,450
What's this?

9
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,550
Since the Amanto came, the Earth's ecosystem has gotten so...weird.

10
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,300
Never mind that. Put it in the bucket.

11
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,700
What?! You're going to eat this?!

12
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,220
Of course I am.

13
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,540
Anko's tasty and Natto's tasty, right?

14
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,910
The more grotesque it looks, the better it tastes when you eat it.

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,860
Even an ugly a woman always has one or two good points.

16
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,770
Gin-chan, Gin-chan!

17
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,460
I caught a huge one. Look, look!

18
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,930
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

19
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,480
Huh? Maybe it doesn't hurt?

20
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,560
No, it does hurt! Ow-ow-ow!

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,500
Say, can we eat it, too?

22
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,090
My dinner!

23
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,230
Forget what you saw just now, okay?

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:46,140
[Kappa, A.K.A. water imp, a mythical water creature]

25
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,270
Gin-san, wasn't that a kappa?

26
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,230
No such thing.

27
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,140
It was just, you know, a regular bald old dude who lives in the pond.

28
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,660
Just the fact that he lives in the pond makes him not a "regular old dude."

29
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,790
And besides, he was green.

30
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,650
That's because...You know...He's got an alcohol addiction.

31
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,080
Nobody'd drink sake if alcohol did that to them!!

32
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,090
You bastards broke my glasses, dammit!

33
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,790
Call your parents! I'm making them pay for this!

34
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,240
It's alive!

35
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,140
Come back here, you guys!

36
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,870
You're not getting away! Tell me your names and addresses!

37
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,820
Look, if you had apologized at the start, I wouldn't be so angry.

38
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,400
If you do something wrong, the right thing to do is to apologize.

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,420
Am I wrong? Why did you run?

40
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,660
Well, because you're a kappa.

41
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,260
A kappa? What's that? Don't try to trick me by talking nonsense!

42
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,680
You're the one who's making the least sense!

43
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,440
What is it about me that doesn't make sense? Tell me, young girl!

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,300
And don't call me "you." Call me Ebina-san.

45
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,240
We're sorry, Ebina-san.

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,630
I'll break my glasses, too, so please forgive us.

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,770
Good. That was a fine apology, son.

48
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,750
Have a biscuit as a reward.

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,330
No thanks, you beast!

50
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,790
Well, it's a good thing it was only my glasses that broke.

51
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,950
If it had been my dish that broke, this old man would have lost it.

52
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,300
I'd have beaten you all to a pulp.

53
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,940
Understand this: nobody lays a finger on this dish.

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,190
The dish broke!

55
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,440
Oh man! The dish broke!

56
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,150
I don't know what's so awful about it, though.

57
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,410
Oh, I'm so sorry.

58
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,820
I was practicing my golf swing when it just slipped out of my hands!

59
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,540
This is why I told you to leave this place.

60
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,790
This isn't your home. This is my property.

61
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,360
Because I bought this entire area...

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,740
Shut up!

63
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,480
I've been living here since back when you were still in your father's jewels!

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,700
Why should I have to leave?!

65
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,470
Stop staring at me! It's embarrassing!

66
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,630
No cameras please. Really.

67
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,750
He's gotten a bit shy after his dish cracked.

68
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,970
What's with that dish, anyway?

69
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,500
I plan to build a huge golf course on this land.

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,710
And this pond is in the way!

71
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,960
I'll find you another pond where you can live, so would you please just leave?

72
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,680
That's not the issue!

73
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,200
This pond doesn't belong only to me.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,230
It's also her...

75
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,270
I don't really understand you, pal.

76
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,770
But if you're going to cause me any more trouble, you'd better be prepared for what's coming.

77
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,200
You never know when the next golf ball is gonna come flying at you.

78
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,260
There, it's fixed, old man.

79
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,900
Huh?! Did you hear a cracking noise?

80
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,190
It's just your imagination.

81
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,320
Old man, if you're going to move, we'll help.

82
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,730
It's none of your business, fool!

83
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,650
Look over there.

84
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,670
See that odd-looking island?

85
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,730
That's the spaceship I rode here on a long time ago.

86
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,970
Ebina-san, you're an Amanto?

87
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,760
Our species can't live without clean water.

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,730
Long ago, our planet lost all its water in a catastrophic natural disaster.

89
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,390
We set out to find a new home.

90
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,590
I found my way to this water planet, Earth.

91
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,010
I was shocked to find such a lovely planet.

92
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,900
At the time, there were hardly any Amanto,

93
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,450
so I felt as though I had this jewel all to myself.

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,160
But earthlings only saw me as a monster.

95
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,590
I was persecuted and forced to return to this pond to live in solitude.

96
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,580
But you know, you only feel alive when you're connected to other people.

97
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,910
I found a safe place to live...But it was like being dead.

98
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,430
Until I met her, that is...

99
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,130
She appeared one day along the pond bank.

100
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,410
She didn't do anything; she just stared out at the water.

101
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,540
At first, I hid from her, but after a while it just seemed silly.

102
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,180
You there, why do you always just sit there?

103
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,830
The girl looked at me, and was a bit surprised, but...

104
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:28,290
I'm lonely and bored in my bedroom, so I thought, "why not be alone out here?"

105
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,320
But there are two of us now.

106
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,600
The girl had a sickness in her lungs.

107
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,320
A contagious disease.

108
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,730
She snuck out of the room where she was kept isolated because no one wanted to be near her.

109
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,080
She didn't care who I was; she just wanted someone to talk to.

110
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,810
And so did I.

111
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,320
Ever since then, the only time I really felt alive was when I was talking with her.

112
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,620
We talked about silly things, but it was fun.

113
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,330
You're lucky, mister.

114
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,560
How so?

115
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,070
You can swim free in such lovely water.

116
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:15,460
I've been frail since childhood, so I've never been able to swim.

117
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,310
Just once, I wish I could swim freely...

118
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,610
In that clear world...

119
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,420
Strengthen your body.

120
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,340
That's impossible. I've been like this all my life.

121
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,380
Silly girl! Life is long.

122
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,390
I'll protect this place until you're strong and healthy.

123
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,300
I'll keep it just as beautiful as it is now.

124
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,140
So, hurry up and get well.

125
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,310
All right. It's a promise, mister.

126
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,670
You bet.

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,040
A promise? But that was decades ago.

128
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
Perhaps. But...

129
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,200
The ship he came on looks like it's been there a long time.

130
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,500
One thing's for sure, that girl is long...

131
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,510
This borders on the insane. I can't go along with this.

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,730
Okay! Everything ready? Get to it.

133
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,140
Right.

134
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,300
I've just about had it with that rotten kappa.

135
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,900
I'm going to bury the entire lake in dirt.

136
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,370
But are you sure it's okay? What about the kappa's curse?

137
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,530
You idiot!

138
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,760
There's no kappa! That's just an Amanto.

139
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,650
Man, why do we have to do this in the dead of night?

140
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,780
What's going on? It stopped...

141
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,110
I'm Saburo, the kappa. Got a cucumber, mister?

142
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,720
What's going on with Nojima?

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,340
Hey, what's going on?

144
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,450
Did the bulldozer snag your jewels or something?!

145
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,030
It is I, Kappa Jiro!

146
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,930
What's with all that screaming?

147
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,630
Did your jewels get caught in the bulldozer or something?

148
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,400
Onishi! Take a look at...

149
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,080
Onishi...?

150
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,360
Wh-Who're you?

151
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,860
I have come from Lake Toya in Ezo.

152
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,550
I am the eldest of the three kappa brothers, Kappa Taro.

153
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,920
Leave this property right now, or the kappa's curse will...

154
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,960
No...not that!

155
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,200
Kappa, what do you want? Cucumbers, right?

156
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,970
Tell me what you want! I don't have much hair, but I have plenty of money!

157
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,580
What we like? Let's see...

158
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,840
Sweets, and guys who take things to extremes, I guess.

159
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,930

What's going on? Tell me!

315
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,660
Huh? I don't know.

316
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,370
I don't know, either! Moron!

317
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,160
Go to hell!

318

I've come too far to turn back now!!

319
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,290
The senpuki...

320
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,930
is mine!

321
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,600
Wh-What?! Who is that guy?!

322
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,340
Was there such a monster in the Earth Defense Army?!

323
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,550
After him! Don't let him get away!

324
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,200
We must get the senpuki at any cost!

325
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,010
What is this place? There's nothing but junk.

326
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,690

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,930
Are these...

330
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,080
gold coins?

331
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,130
Surprised, are you?

332
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,710
This was built by the brilliant mechanical engineering prodigy, Juttoku.

333
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,940
It's the robotic gold-coin counterfeiting machine no. 3.

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,420
We call it senpuki, for short!

337
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,150
Thank you for showing us the way here.

338
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,420
Now hand over the senpuki! You'll do it if you value your comrade's life!

339

Never mind me! Quickly destroy it!

What?

I mean, not like this, but the part that whirs around...

I'm asking you where that is!

349
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,570
Curse you... Damned Earth Defense Army! You won't get away with this!

350
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,600
Now that it's come to this, I'll use my greatest secret weapon to put an end to you.

351
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,350
This thing...

352
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,680
I knew I should've bought an air conditioner.

353
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,140
Air conditioners are the way of the future.

Thank you.

You are a hero who saved Edo.

361
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:16,600
I don't have much, but, but I do have an air conditioner at home.

362
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,460
I don't want an air conditioner.

363
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,140
Like I said from the beginning, I...

364

Well, you know.

365
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,450
It took blood and guts to get this senpuki, you see.

366
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,630
Look at this brilliant luster.

367
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,480
Doesn't that look a little filthy?

368
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,700
That's because your eyes are a little filthy, Shinpachi-kun.

369
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,880
Now this time, use it with care so you don't break it.

370
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,420
No, you were the one who broke it.

371

What? What?

372
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,800
What? That's odd. It won't turn on.

373

You made up that story.

There's no Earth Defense Army.
Your story was too long!

What did you use the money you brought with you for? Pachinko?!

378

Ow-ow.

379

Just a minute! It really is the truth!
