00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,990
The trip has been full of hardships.

159
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,920
Well, we'll explore all of
that a week from today.

160
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,280
All of Edo will assist in helping
implement the smoking ban.

161
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,830
But finally he heads off into the universe.

162
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,290
To smoke some cigarettes!

163
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,650
However, when he arrives
on Planet Hamek,

164
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,170
he finds it was turned into a
scorched field by Breeza.

165
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,150
Da...Dad!

166
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,590
Dad!

167
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,700
The young boy Delde's tears...

168
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:54,480
Hijikata channels his anger into power
and he heads toward the final battle.

169
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,760
Hey! Why am I suddenly having flashbacks
of the previous episode?

170
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,900
This isn't Dragon BLEEP!

171
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,220
It's taking too long! I'm in a hurry!
Let's get to the main episode now!

172
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,410
I never suspected that
you were against me.

173
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,310
But I admire your rashness.

174
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:29,080
But when you see my power, I wonder
if you'll still have the same attitude.

175
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,880
Well, I'll show you.

176
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,200
My full power!

177
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,330
How about that? You look like
you're scared speechless.

178
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,940
Get ready for it.

179
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,440
Here I come.

180
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,110
Hey, give me a cigarette.

181
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,080
I know you have some.

182
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,840
You destroyed Planet Hamek,
didn't you? Where are they?

183
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,730
I, Breeza-sama, was knocked down
by a monkey like you.

184
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,260
It can't be...you're a legendary
Super Earthling.

185
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,260
[Note: Parody of Super Saiyan from Dragon Ball.]

186
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,220
Shut up, already. Just
give me a cigarette.

187
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,410
I'm grumpy now thanks
to nicotine withdraw.

188
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,980
You're the Super Earthling
who woke up irritated.

189
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,750
Don't tell me you're the
son of that Earthling

190
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,940
who was the only one to
challenge me back then?

191
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,090
Huh, who's this? I don't
look nothing like him.

192
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,750
You're totally wrong.

193
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,660
Can it be that you're searching
for the same thing I was?

194
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,560
Huh?

195
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,630
Whatever. I praise you for defeating me,

196
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,200
the emperor of the universe,
so I will give you this.

197
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,700
Here, take it.

198
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,170
That's not what I asked for!

199
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,150
I said, give me some cigarettes!

200
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,570
What's this ball? It's so disgusting!

201
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,380
It's an Ooey-gooey ball.

202
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,380
[Note: Parody of Dragon Ball from Dragon Ball.]

203
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,380
When you collect all seven of those balls,

204
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,040
the Ooey-gooey dragon will appear

205
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,550
and make everything you want
turn Ooey-gooey.

206
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,770
It's a really mysterious ball.

207
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,870
Why Ooey-gooey? I think
you're lying to me!

208
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,010
If there's anything you
want but can't find,

209
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:28,390
you should collect six more balls
and have your wishes granted.

210
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,340
Hey! Why are you making that kind
of face made by the super villain

211
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,420
right before he dies in the big scene
at the end of the episode?

212
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,680
Anyway, why do I have to do all
of this just to get a cigarette?!

213
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,620
Give me a break.

214
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,700
It'll be a lot faster if I just
go to another planet

215
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,780
and buy a pack of cigarettes
at a vending machine.

216
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,900
That's right. I should've done
that earlier. I'll go do that.

217
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,880
Grillin! Open your eyes, Grillin!

218
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,880
[Note: Parody of Krillin & Goku from Dragon Ball.]

219
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,440
Damn it! If only I had
all the Ooey-gooey balls!

220
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,190
Grillin!

221
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,460
...Hey, what are you doing?

222
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,700
I'm trying to revive Grillin.

223
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,650
Who the heck is Grillin?!

224
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,430
You came to smoke some
cigarettes, right?

225
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,890
And who's that sitting right next to you?!

226
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,630
Yo! I'm Kobayashi! I'm so excited!

227
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,630
[Note: Parody of Goku and
Yamcha from Dragon Ball.]

228
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,130
Kobayashi?! I'm not excited
about that name at all!

229
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,170
[Note: Refers to Bulma from Dragon Ball.
She dated Yamcha in the series.]

230
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,170
You're Bulma's ex-boyfriend,
aren't you?

231
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,610
Shut up!

232
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,250
You know, Grillin might
have some cigarettes!

233
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,160
I'll definitely smoke next time, damn it!

234
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,580
[Note: Parody of Cell from Dragon Ball.]

235
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,580
I'm Celo!

236
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,840
That's enough! You're so persistent.

237
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,060
I know it's going to take a long time.

238
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,420
I get bored easy. Hey, just give me
some balls. You have some, right?

239
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,330
Why? Why does he have
so much power?

240
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,000
Shut up!

241
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,630
Hurry up and give me some balls so I can
revive Grillin and smoke a cigarette.

242
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,480
I can't believe I lost after taking
cells from the Super Earthling...

243
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,370
[Note: Parody of the scouter device from Dragon Ball.]

244
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,370
Who is this guy? What's with the
scouter rip-off? It pisses me off!

245
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,950
You defeated me, the perfect form, after
I took in every cell and powered up.

246
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,200
Your attack deserves to be rewarded.

247
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,320
As you wish, I'll give you my balls.

248
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,960
Take these.

249
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,670
You hid these in there?!
They're disgusting and dirty!

250
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:34,640
Use these balls to summon the dragon
and make a wish for me.

251
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,990
My wish is

252
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,560
"To graduate from being a virgin..."

253
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,350
Why are you making it sound like
I'm helping you grant your wish?!

254
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,650
And why did you make
such a useless wish?!

255
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,590
Anyway, now that I've collected
all seven balls.

256
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,830
Hurry up and revive Grillin
so I can smoke a cigarette!

257
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,110
What's this? Can I eat this?

258
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,620
There's no way you can eat that disgusting
thing! What about Grillin?

259
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,700
Oh, that's right!

260
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,530
Hurry up and summon the dragon
so it can revive Grillin!

261
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,500
Come out Ooey-gooey Dragon!
Please make my wish come true!

262
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,280
...Huh?

263
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,980
Nothing happened. There're seven
balls all together. What's going on?

264
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,220
Oh? Taking a closer look, this one
isn't an Ooey-gooey ball at all!

265
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,210
What?

266
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,980
The other six balls are real Ooey-gooey
balls. But this one is...

267
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,920
...a Sticky-icky ball!

268
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,450
It's pretty much the same!

269
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,550
What's the difference between
that and an Ooey-gooey ball?!

270
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,510
Yo. It's a Sticky-icky ball!

271
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,750
That's just a technicality!

272
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,970
See?! Something is coming out!

273
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,490
They're all Ooey-gooey balls, after all.

274
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,180
Great job in collecting all
the Slimy-grimy balls.

275
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,430
It's not Ooey-gooey, nor Sticky-icky!

276
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,420
That's the least of our problems.
Hey, hurry up and save Grillin.

277
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,440
I see. It's not Ooey-gooey.
Then I don't care.

278
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,700
Why?! How much loyalty do
you have for Ooey-gooey?!

279
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,930
How badly do you want to
make Grillin Ooey-gooey?!

280
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,550
Just ask him! It doesn't matter
if he's Slimy-grimy!

281
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,760
He's your friend, right?

282
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,810
If it's Slimy-grimy, I prefer
something else.

283
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,400
What do you mean, something else?

284
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,990
Give me some gal's panties!

285
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,990
[Note: A famous line from Dragon Ball when they
first met Shen Long, the dragon.]

286
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,190
Hey!

287
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,560
A gal's Slimy-grimy panties?!

288
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,730
That's such a gross wish!

289
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,400
Don't request a pair of dirty panties
and give up your friend!

290
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,020
Never mind! Forget it!

291
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,550
Hurry up. Or the Slimy-grimy will dry up.

292
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,730
Wait! Hold on a second!

293
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,620
If I have a Slimy-grimy cigarette,
I can't smoke it.

294
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,750
What should I wish for?

295
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,750
I'm about to dry up!

296
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,620
I know!

297
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,260
I'll get the last one.

298
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,930
You're...

299
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,160
Why are you here again?

300
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,570
I've changed my mind...
I want the last cigarette.

301
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,010
I know that's an important memento
from your dad. But...

302
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,820
...you don't need a memento anymore
if you have your dad back.

303
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,030
Don't tell me... Da...

304
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,230
Yeah. It's your dad.

305
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,540
Whose dad is he?!

306
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,850
What's with this Ooey-gooey?!

307
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,050
No, it's not Ooey-gooey, it's Slimy-grimy!

308
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,670
There's a limit to disgracing the dead!

309
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,830
No, it's true. Even if it's
Slimy-grimy, he's real...

310
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,270
It's you again.

311
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,910
Were you able to smoke
a cigarette, after all?

312
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,840
Where will you go next?

313
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,600
I've decided...

314
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,920
...to quit smoking.

315
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,340
After Hijikata returned to earth,

316
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,030
he wasn't able to give
up smoking, after all.

317
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:01,940
In order to get the legendary cigarette,
Hijikata works hard at training.

318
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,380
And a new powerful enemy appears before him.

319
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,830
Next episode will be Ooey-gooey
ball, episode 120.

320
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,760
Cut it out! This can't be right!

321
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,720
[Note: Parody of next week
remark from Dragon Ball.]

322
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,720
Everyone! Please watch it!

323
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,850
I said, shut up!

324
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:25,270
[Preview]

325
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,280
Oh, good for you, Hasegawa-san.

326
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,220
I heard you'll head up the conveyor belt sushi
restaurant all by yourself, after all.

327
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,520
The next episode... "Once you've chosen
a dish, you can't give it back."

328
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,780
Have some sushi!

329
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,890
[Actually, there'll be two episodes next week. The other episode... "Japanese Restaurants Abroad Taste Pretty Much like School Cafeteria Lunches"]

330
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,020
[The plan is to sneak into an Amanto restaurant,
but for some reason, Prince Hata was working there.]

331
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,010
[See you next time.]
