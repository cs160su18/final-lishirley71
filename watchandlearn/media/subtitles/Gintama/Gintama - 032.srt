How do you read this?

11
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,310
It's Sagaru. Sagaru Yamazaki.

12
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,630
Yes. My name is Sagaru Yamazaki.

Oh. I see.

Of course, I have not lost my job. In fact, it's my job that brings me here.

Actually, due to certain circumstances, I've snuck into this place to do an undercover investigation.

Umm, what's the Shinsengumi? Can I call you Shin-chan?

37

Hold on! I told you that this is an undercover investigation.

If one of the branches is moved, the others will start to move too.

57
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:57,240
But if that tree has withered...Then its branches may just fall off.

58
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,910

We may be little branches...but if the branches break, then the tree really will wither.

62

So I won't break.

63

Even if winter comes and the leaves fall off.

64
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,070
Even if the wind blows and all the other branches fall down, I'll be the last branch of all!

Wait. We'll bring back Gin-chan.

You'll bring him back? Do you even know where he is?

74
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,170

It's like this! You put this here and assemble it!

Anyway, what are we making? What does this factory produce?

84
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,530
It's obvious. Justaways dolls, of course!

I'm asking you what a "Justaway" is!

86
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,070
A Justaway is a Justaway. Nothing else. Nothing more, nothing less.

87
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,840
But it's just a piece of junk! How am I supposed to care about making one!

Wow! He's incredibly fast!

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,110
As expected of Sakata-san. He rolls out Justaways so fast you can't even see 'em!

92
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,560
At this rate, he'll make vice-president inside a year!

93
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,550
Everyone, try not to lose to him!

94
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,430
All right!

95
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,150

No, I still haven't found anything out. Yes...

97
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,300
Really?! All right. I'll head back right away.

98
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,450
I'm checking out of here. Apparently, Chief Kondo has gone missing.

99
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,450
Jimmy, you can't abandon your Justaways just for that.

100
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,800
Nobody does well in the beginning. You'll get used to things.

101

There are some dark rumors about the plant Boss.

104

To the public, he's a humanitarian taking care of down-and-out samurai who can't find jobs.

until he can carry out his plan to overthrow the government.

107
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,390
This factory is actually building weapons to supply the rebels.

108
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,810
And now he's preparing a weapon of mass destruction.

109
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,340
There aren't any good rumors about him.

110
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,070
Well, in the end, this is the only thing I found...

111
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,410
But as they say, "where's there's smoke, there's fire"...

112
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,400
Are you saying that he's an erowrist?! I mean terrorist?

113
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,010
Stop making up excuses!

114
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,780
That man is my benefactor. It takes balls to hire down-and-outers like me!

115
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,520
I don't think it takes balls.

116
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,190
More like a maniacal scheme running off slave labor.

117
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,180
Anyway, what happened to you?

118
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:07,040
I was just a worthless degenerate before I got this job.

119
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,740
Boss...

120
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,120
Is that so? I'm a little disappointed.

121
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,670
I mean, not about you being a degenerate. That's obvious.

122
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,520
But Chief Kondo and Vice-chief Okita obviously respect you.

123
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,770
Sakata-san, work's about to start.

124

Oh no.

125
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,780
I'll be off...

126
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,870
Sakata-san, could you look at my Justaway?

127
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,130
What do you think of it?

128
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,520
Well, I think you should lift this up just a bit, Gorilla-san.

129
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,020
Have you lost your frikiking mind?!

130
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,020
Gorilla-san!

131
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,500
Hello? I found the idiot. Yes. I'm taking him back right away.

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,140
Gorilla-san, get a hold of yourself!

133
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,100
Jimmy, what was that for?!

134
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,700
Gorilla-san is another amnesia victim!

135
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,110
His brain's like a cheap game console! Bump it and it freezes!

136
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,000
Amnesia?! Is that true, Chief?!

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,240
You're an idiot, but why have you got such a complicated condition?!

138
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,570
You're such an idiot!

139
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,690
That's going overboard, Jimmy. Idiots, in their own idiotic way, have their own idiotic problems!

140
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,590
Shut up. I'm tired. You two are such a pain.

141
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,460
Anyway, we're going home, Chief!

142
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,430
Stop! I still have to fix my Justaway!!

143
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,290
I want people to be proud of me! I want to be special!!

144
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,030
It doesn't matter what it is, but I promised pops I was going to become number one.

145
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,580
Then don't worry. You're the world's biggest idiot.

146
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,010
Come on. Quickly!

147
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,560
No! No!

An explosion!

149
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,110
Boss, did a Justaway accidentally go off?

150
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,290
Who is responsible for this?!

151
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,790
No way!

152
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,200
The Justaway exploded!!

153
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,420
No way! We were making bombs?!

154
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,380
This is terrible... Did pops really do this?

155
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,470
He griped a lot about losing his job because of the government and swore vengeance, but...

156
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,770
Of course it's him! These are all top grade ingredients!

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,600
What about it can't you believe?

158
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,370
It's not the Justaway's fault! That man was bad.

159
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,760
The Justaways have done no wrong.

160
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,950
Are you still carrying those? Get rid of them right away!!

161
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,400
You bastards! How dare you ruin my plans!

162
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,730
I'm going to slaughter you spies!

163
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,800
Ack! Pops is headed this way!

164
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,090
Jimmy, this way.

165
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,580
You're not getting away from me!!

166
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,810
Hey! I thought you couldn't fight him! But you didn't hesitate there!

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,850
Did I say that, Gorilla-san?

168
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,990
It's no good. I can't remember. I have amnesia.

169
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,070
What a convenient form of amnesia!

170
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,320
Don't move.

171
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
Too bad.

172
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,660
Though I may not look it, I used to chase crooks as a police officer.

173
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,870
They called me Banzo the Viper.

174
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,610
You got me pretty good. I never thought that you were government spies.

175
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,610
Just a little longer and I would have taught them all a lesson.

176
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,200
But now that this has happened,

177
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,480
I still have the power to turn this rotten world upside down.

178
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,580
All right, step back. It's dangerous. You'll end up like him.

179
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,060
He doesn't look hurt, but trust me he's suffering inside.

180
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,680
Hell of a mess that turned out to be.

181
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,820
You're pretty messy too.

182
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,560
You think that jerk Yamazaki died in that?

183
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,030
I'll bet you're going to die, too, aren't you?

184
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,220
Vice-chief!

185
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,230
We just got word that the Chief is inside with Yamazaki.

186
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,750
What?

187
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,010
Come on. If it was just Yamazaki, I was going to say forget it.

188
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,440
But I can't do that if Kondo-san is with him.

189
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,280
Hijikata-san...

190
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,790
I forgot my flute at home. I'm going to go and fetch it.

191
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,340
Okay. Don't come back.

192
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,950
Jeez. How pathetic. That's enough. I'll go by myself. You all wait here.

193
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,660
Hey!! Look over there!

194
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,700
Something's coming out.

195
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,030
What's that?

196
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,790
A cannon?! A big-ass cannon came out!

197
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,680
T-That's the weapon they were secretly building?

198
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,460
Sogo, I forgot my protractor at home. I'm going to go and fetch it.

199
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,900
Hijikata-san, it's all right. I have a protractor right here.

200
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,540
October 6. Today, my father hit me for the first time.

201
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,230
It was a hard punch.

202
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,020
It was a punch from a man who shouldered

203
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,690
our family and many important responsibilities on his back.

204
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,750
My pitiful little fist couldn't have hit like that.

205
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,560
It was the punch of a loser who quit his job

206
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,880
and never held anything but a game console controller for two years and three months.

207
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,670
I don't care what you do with your life.

208
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,990
You've got to live with yourself.

209
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,590
Just understand this: If you wallow in crap, you're going to stink.

210
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,110
As he left for work after saying these words, his shoulders looked broader to me than ever before.

211
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,940
Could I become strong like my father?

212
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,510
I went outside for the first time in two years.

213
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,940
My legs naturally followed my father.

214
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,570
Banzo the Viper. That was my father's other name.

215
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,080
Mamushi, a police officer who made criminals tremble.

216
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,420
I wanted to see his face. I wanted to learn what it was to know him.

217
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,620
But all I saw...was a beaten man with a cheap sake bottle in his hands.

218
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,390
He'd lost his job to downsizing the month before.

219
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,670
No!!

220
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,390
You can't imagine how that felt!

221
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,360
How it felt to read my son's diary!!

222
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,020
If I'd kept my job just a little longer, he would have straightened out his life!

223
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,990
Instead, my son went from being a recluse to becoming a yakuza!

224
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,920
He's gone from the north pole to the south pole.

225
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,970
That's a great thing to talk about over drinks.

226
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,930
Am I supposed to take that and keep smiling?

227
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:17,000
I devoted thirty years of my life to my country,

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,420
but my family and the government dumped me like I was garbage!

229
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,670
There's something wrong! There's something wrong with this world!

230
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,850
So I'm going to change it!!

231
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm going to destroy this corrupt country and

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,750
cause a revolution with this Viper Z that took me ten years to make!

233
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:37,120
It's a corrupt country, but you mustn't forget that people live here.

234
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,970
Before you start a revolution in this country, why don't you start one within yourself?

235
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,050
That's a lot cheaper.

236
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,650
Shut up! You can't understand how I feel!

237
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,640
Ready the cannon.

238
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,030
No, not that way.

239
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,140
Why are you surprised?! I'm the one who should be surprised!

240
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,270
Vice-chief!! Isn't that...

241
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,640
Chief! Yamazaki! Huh?! Why is that guy there, too?

242
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,990
I know that... They're your friends.

243
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,290
Shoot if you want to stop me. But they'll be blown to bits, too.

244
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,620
Sogo!

245
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,840
Long ago, Kondo may or may not have said that if he was caught by an enemy

246
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,690
to shoot without hesitation.

247
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,970
You fired at them because of a perfunctory reason like that?!

248
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,900
They fired! They fired at us!

249
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,460
Who are those people?! I thought you said they were your friends?!

250
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,320
They're not my friends!

251
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,640
Chief, I'm going to quit the Shinsengumi. Huh? Where's the Chief?

252
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,790
Hey. Over here. Is everyone safe? Are you all right?

253
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,540
Chief, are you all right?!

254
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,190
It's as if I've just awakened from a long dream.

255
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,570
Chief, could it be that your memories have returned?

256
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,790
Uh, your head...!

257
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,680
Yes. It's as if the fog has cleared from my mind.

258
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,420
It's refreshing. Yamazaki, it seems I caused you a lot of trouble.

259
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,500
Not really. But, your head...

260
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,640
Anyway, right now, it's time for us to get out of here. Let's go.

261
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,650
Chief! Wait!

262
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,610
He's still...

263
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,650
It's all right. Go, Jimmy, Gorilla-san.

264
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,340
Clear out before they catch you.

265
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,220
Such a pain! Normally, I'd just leave you, but you've done no wrong!

266
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,020
Buy me a beer when you get your memory back.

267
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,420
Gorilla-san...

268
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,930
Hey! What are you doing?

269
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,830
Now! Fire!!

270
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,940
Boss!!

271
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,840
Fire! Use the... Viper Z!

272
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,480
Crap!!

273
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,790
Chief!!

274
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,000
Hey, is everyone still alive?

275
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,210
This thing is insane.

276
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,500
It seems like it has enough power to really be able to wipe out the country.

277
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,380
Chief!

278
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,870
Chief, get a hold of yourself!

279
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,150
Chief! Chief!

280
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,720
Chief!

281
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:28,280
Did you see the power of the Viper Z?! With this, Edo will be scorched in an instant.

282
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,900
Go ahead! Just try to stop me!

283
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,350
You weak samurai who have adjusted to the times cannot stop me!

284
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,570
Come on! If you don't hurry, I'll force my next shot.

285
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,630
Everyone's Edo will become a scorched field!

286
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,700
What's wrong? Are you frozen in fear? How pathetic.

287
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,160
If you want to shoot, be our guest.

288
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,100
We don't care if you fry or boil Edo.

289
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,580
You just better not shoot these people.

290
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,470
Wh-Who are you?! This isn't a place for kids!

291
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,190
Go home. Do you want to turn into ashes?!

292
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,190
W-Why?

293
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,900
Why are you here? Why did you come all the way here?

294
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,970
Didn't I tell you to forget all about me?

295
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,430
I said we should live however we wanted to.

296
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,660
You didn't have to tell us that. We're already living the way we want to.

297
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,540
We came here because we wanted to.

298
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,160
We came here to be with you.

299
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,880
Why? I don't get it.

300
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,950
The Gin-san right now seems a lot more serious than that worthless Gin-san...

301
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,680
They called me a worthless man.

302
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,150
I mean, not about you being a degenerate.

303
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,870
Why am I...

304
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,180
Why are they all...

305
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,910
here?

306
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,250
You kids stay out of this. Do you want to die?

307
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,350
What?! You're a kid, too!

308
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,960
What's with you guys anyway?

309
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,980
I don't like it, but it's our job. We have to protect ordinary citizens.

310
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,020
What about it, Mr. Viper? If you want to fire, fire on us all.

311
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,640
I don't care if it's the Chin Cannon

312
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,960
That's right. Shoot at us, Mr. Laid-off cop!!

313
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,990
Baldy! Downsized baldy!

314
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,770
Since when was I bald?!

315
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,850
All right! I'll wipe you away before I wipe away Edo!

316
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,380
Before you wipe us out...

317
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,410
We'll... Wipe you out!

318
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,080
Go!

319
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,340
Quickly, fire!

320
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,110
We still need... Time to charge!

321
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,270
The Justaway!! Don't let them get any closer!

322
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,480
Is it ready yet?!

323
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,090
Shinpachi, you brought my wooden sword with you, didn't you?

324
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,500
Huh? Oh... Yes.

325
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,250
Boss.

326
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,390
Sorry but I'm handing in my resignation.

327
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,830
G-Gin-chan!!

328
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,830
G-Gin-san!!

329
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,780
Sorry, but...

330
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,330
I'm better at...

331
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,560
being a free agent.

332
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,300
Die... Sakata!!

333
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,610
Thank you for helping me out.

334
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,120
Let's go home.

335
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,020
That's how I like to see him. Right, Chief?

336
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,590
Who are you?

337
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:22,110
[Preview]

338
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,530
Gin-san is back!

339
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,430
My memory has come back, but the Odd Jobs has been demolished!

340
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,370
Huh?

341
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,000
Unkei and Kaikei, the delivery carpenters?

342
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,300
I never asked for them! I want someone else!

343
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,820
The next episode: "Mistaking Someone's Name Is Rude!"

344
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:30,210
[It will require a lot of power to fix the Odd Jobs.]

345
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:35,050
[So hammer with us. Come on.]

346
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,400
A round of applause for Gin-chan and the gang for giving it their all again today!
