Teach me! Ginpachi Sensei

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,270
Pen name Gin World asks:

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,630
How many members are there
in the Shinsengumi?

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,130
In Episode 20, about the
mosquito-like Amanto,

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,070
they said 18 members
were "more than half."

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,630
Since the Shinsengumi
has up to Squad 10

9
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,670
that means there are only
2-3 people per squad.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,660
Is the Shinsengumi comprised
of 35-36 men?

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,880
Okay, here's your answer.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,870
The Shinsengumi regularly recruits members
and has grown into a giant organization.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,160
In the Crisis Arc, Kondo tried
to return to his hometown

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,360
because he wanted to recruit members.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,650
Currently, there are roughly
10 men per squad.

16
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,480
By the way, you must never go back
and pause previous episodes

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,480
to count the number of people.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,190
In anime, 10 or more are
counted as "many."

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,630
And so, transfer-student Saito, go
and stand outside in the hallway!

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,630
[Note: Saito is the new editor for GinTama manga.]

21

[Earlier, when we received a large amount of mail supporting us, a bigwig said, "Something's going on, right?"]

22

[Three years and still zero trust. Anime
"GinTama" continues its popular run!!]

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,270
Do you understand, Kyojiro?
This is you...

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,960
The Guardian dog always stands
in front of his master,

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,100
unmoving, protecting his
master from all harm.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,570
Look at this face...isn't it magnificent?

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,970
I think you can grow up
into a man as noble,

28
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,820
majestic and strong as
this Guardian dog.

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,900
But that really depends
on you. Work hard...

30
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,180
Whoa! It's huge!

31
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,830
You know, I think it's finally happening!

32
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,390
I don't know what sort of job this is,

33
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,780
but I think we can look forward to
major compensation this time!

34
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,890
We'll be feasting tonight!

35
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,940
After all, we've never been
picked up like this!

36
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,950
Quiet, you two. You're embarrassing us.

37
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,330
Thank you.

38
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,150
Think it's a top Bakufu official?

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,370
We've become quite famous.

40
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,250
Let's do our best.

41
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,690
["Kids Don't Understand How Their Parents Feel"]

42
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,280
Gin-san...I feel like I could be shot
full of holes at any moment.

43
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,250
This goes way beyond
giving us the evil eye.

44
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,110
Think they're trying to fire laser
beams at us with their eyes?

45
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,290
Listen, they're probably going to tell us
to deliver some white powder for them.

46
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,380
I'm sure it's flour, so just quietly
do as they say, okay?

47
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,070
Understood.

48
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,220
Stop that Gin-san. Don't
give up hope so soon.

49
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,510
You guys the Odd jobs?

50
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,600
Thanks for coming.

51
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,790
I'm your client, Kaguzo Mashiroi,
boss of the Mashiroi Gang.

52
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,790
[Note: In Japanese: Mashiroi Kaguzo can mean
"I'm gonna sniff some white (powder)."]

53
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,380
Uh-oh, he's about to sniff
some white powder.

54
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,170
The reason I called you here
today is...look over there...

55
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,890
See that storehouse?

56
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,800
Inside, is the...

57
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,900
Uh-oh, here he comes...

58
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,760
the white powder.

59
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,950
the Mashiroi...

60
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,950
[Note: In Japanese: Mashiroi is a
homonym that can mean "white."]

61
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,710
The Mashiroi Gang's successor...my
only son, Utsuzo Mashiroi,

62
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,080
[Note: In Japanese: Utsuzo means "depressed and stored away" and "to shoot up." So Utsuzo Mashiroi can mean "I'm gonna shoot up some white (powder)."]

63
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,080
who's locked himself in there.

64
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,890
Huh?

65
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,710
Five years ago Utsuzo locked himself
in there and never came out.

66
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,310
He detested becoming a yakuza
and went to earn an honest living

67
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,830
as an apprentice at a textile wholesaler.

68
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,080
But then he abruptly returned
from his apprenticeship,

69
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,800
moved all his personal effects into the storehouse
and hasn't stepped foot outside since.

70
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,090
I haven't even seen him
the past five years.

71
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,300
C'mon, are you sure he's not
already dead in there?

72
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,290
Stop it, Gin-san.

73
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,540
No, I haven't seen or spoken
to him for five years,

74
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,220
but a note with his meal requests and things he wants
appears between the gap in the door every day.

75
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,050
You're right. There's one now.

76
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,560
Boss!

77
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,890
Guys! Animage, JUMP
and a Hepsi NEX!

78
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,890
[Note: Parody of Pepsi NEX. Animage is an
anime magazine from Tokuma Shoten.]

79
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,810
Got it!

80
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,590
A yakuza's son shutting himself off...

81
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,520
If word got out-my reputation is everything-I
could never remain a yakuza.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,270
I've been so concerned about how it would
look even though I know it's silly,

83
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,900
that I haven't even confronted
my son face-to-face.

84
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,420
By the time I realized it,
five years had passed.

85
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,400
I'm responsible for driving
Utsuzo into going this far.

86
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,310
I'm willing to do anything
to get my son back.

87
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,720
...But as pitiful as this sounds,
I don't know what I should do.

88
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,270
What should a parent do
in a situation like this?

89
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,180
Just stand there and watch.

90
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,640
If you feel that way, that's enough.

91
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,940
Leave the rest to us.

92
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,950
Yakuza aren't comfortable
with delicate work, right?

93
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,980
...You people...

94
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,510
Essentially, you want us to drag your
son out of the storehouse, right?

95
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,050
Hey, Kagura.

96
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,050
Come on out! Get a job, you stupid son!

97
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,280
Hey! Even yakuza could've done that!

98
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,990
Do you know what "delicate" means?

99
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,040
Young Boss!

100
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,970
Dammit! What the hell are you doing?!

101
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,040
Just a minute. We understand,
we understand.

102
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,870
We'll be more delicate! Just don't kill us!

103
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,640
What is all this?

104
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,850
Are these guys comedians doing
a life-or-death routine?!

105
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,080
I feel like a fawn that's stumbled
into the polar bear cage.

106
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,590
What hasn't changed is our lives
are still hanging by a thread here.

107
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,780
Please be delicate.

108
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,980
We have you completely surrounded.

109
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,270
Cease your resistance and
come out peacefully!

110
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,810
If you don't do as we say,

111
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,840
we will repeat our demands every
two hours, morning and night!

112
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,550
Do yourself a favor by giving yourself
up before you get raccoon eyes!

113
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,650
Otherwise we'll throw you
into a bear cage, dammit!

114
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,790
That's not very convincing!

115
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,440
Don't play games, dammit!

116
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,160
Don't think you can get away with
threatening a yakuza's son!

117
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,310
Huh? It's a note! A note just came out!

118
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,560
He must've had a change of heart!

119
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,350
Boss!

120
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:30,060
[Note: Refers to NHK's "On Air Battle." Amateur comedians perform for 100 judges who drop golf balls in a bucket if they like the comedian. Kilobattle (KB) is the unit used to measure the weight of the bucket. 545 KB is a perfect score and 93KB is a zero score.]

121
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,860
Two-kilobattle...?

122
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,770
Isn't that score a bit low?

123
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,060
What the hell is this?!

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,870
Can't you tell? It's a charcoal brazier.

125
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,560
I could tell that by looking.
What I was asking was...

126
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,720
No, no. Say no more. This
is my strategy. I call it...

127
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,670
You call it...

128
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,690
Huh? That looks like fun.

129
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,900
When he opens the door a crack
to peek out, we drag him out!

130
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,440
That's the plan!

131
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,240
Let me explain.

132
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,570
The "Huh? That looks like fun.

133
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,640
When he opens the door
a crack to peek out,

134
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,430
we drag him out!" plan works like this...

135
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,970
First, we grill meat or something
on this charcoal brazier.

136
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,880
Then we throw a lively party to attract
the Young Boss's attention.

137
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,000
You're just retelling the
story of Amanoiwato!

138
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,000
[Note: Parody of the Amaterasu myth. She shut herself
in a cave and the gods threw a party to lure her out.]

139
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,010
Just to let you know, forcing
the doors open is my job!

140
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,190
Who cares?! Enough of this silliness!

141
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,640
Man, you yakuza have no patience.

142
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,230
Did you really think we Odd Jobs would come
up with such a simple-minded plan?

143
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,910
All of your plans up to now
have been simple-minded.

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,440
There's more to this plan. In other
words, it has two stages!

145
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,370
Two stages, you say?!

146
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,330
Let me explain!

147
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,170
If he doesn't show interest in our party,

148
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,230
we'll leave the food on the brazier
and use it to smoke the kid out!

149
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,970
Stop it!

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,720
You're playing games with us!

151
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,940
Don't think you can make fools
of yakuza and get away with it!

152
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,840
We're sorry. We won't do it
anymore! Really, we won't!

153
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,480
Oh, it's another note.

154
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,940
Boss!

155
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,280
Smoky...

156
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,560
Definitely.

157
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,170
Oh, okay, okay! We'll use our last resort.

158
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,640
What is it? Do you have a plan?

159
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,290
I do! There's one way to
definitely get him out!

160
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,840
Hey, Kagura!

161
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,850
That plan, huh?

162
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,970
Come on out! Get a job, you stupid son!

163
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,140
That was the first thing you
tried! The first, not the last!

164
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,150
Young Boss!

165
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,950
Dammit! What the hell are you doing?!

166
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,730
Another note! He's still all right!

167
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,040
Really?!

168
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,170
[Farewell.]

169
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,740
This is his dying message!

170
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,180
What the hell have you
done?! You idiots!

171
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,870
What're you going to do about this?!

172
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,780
Hey, that's enough.

173
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,520
This isn't blood. It's tomato juice.

174
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
Seems the Young Boss
is eating his vegetables.

175
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,270
I'm relieved.

176
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,380
Brother!

177
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:58,950
Who's that?

178
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,250
That's our junior boss,
Kyojiro Nakamura.

179
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,420
Utsuzo thought of him like a brother back
when he was still out and about.

180
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,230
He knows Utsuzo better than I do.

181
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,270
Boss, it's appalling to see all these
adults made fools of by a kid.

182
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,900
I've...decided to deal with
my son face-to-face.

183
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,510
It's too late for that.

184
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,430
You should just leave Utsuzo alone.

185
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,660
When the time is right, he'll
come out on his own.

186
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,540
Don't hurt Utsuzo any more
than you already have.

187
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,190
I won't let you forget what you did to him.

188
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,500
B-Boss!

189
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,910
Boss, hold on!

190
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,610
Hanzo! Get a gurney, now!

191
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,680
R-Right!

192
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,490
Hey! Pull yourself together, Boss!

193
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,370
Boss!

194
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,250
Gin-san!

195
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,980
The two of you go with
them to the hospital.

196
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,970
What about you, Gin-chan?

197
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,010
Me? I...

198
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,490
I see... No, you men
stay with him tonight.

199
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,740
Yeah...I'll take care of things
here. Don't worry about it.

200
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,590
I'll bring Young Boss his meal.

201
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,630
Huh? The kids are a nuisance?

202
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,110
You mean the kids the boss
hired? Ignore them.

203
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,310
How cruel is that?

204
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,540
His father collapsed, but
he won't even budge.

205
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,800
Your client collapsed.

206
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,010
There's no reason for you
to remain here, is there?

207
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,660
I just want to see his face-

208
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,780
the face of the obstinate son who won't
budge even as his father is about to die.

209
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,670
...You suspected, didn't you?

210
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,060
...What the Boss did was that bad...

211
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,530
Here.

212
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,220
Hey, is this okay? Isn't
this for the idiot son?

213
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,030
Never mind. Only those who work
can enjoy the taste of sake.

214
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,190
I've known the Young Boss
since he was a little kid.

215
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,660
He was meek, gentle, and despised the
yakuza way of life even back then.

216
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,740
He didn't have what it takes
to live in this world.

217
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,340
He chose to make an honest living
against the Boss's wishes.

218
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,580
He seemed happy at his job...

219
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,090
But that didn't last long.

220
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,580
It was the Boss.

221
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,460
Utsuzo was his heir.

222
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,880
Boss tried to bring him back to the
yakuza world by showing up

223
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,070
at the Young Boss's workplace and
harassing the store over and over.

224
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,300
Once people found out they were related,
Utsuzo was immediately fired.

225
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,810
It's all the Boss's fault that the
Young Boss is the way he is.

226
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,330
He's making a big fuss now
over getting the Young Boss

227
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,760
out after ignoring him all this time because
he knows his death is imminent.

228
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,210
He's desperately trying to make his
son succeed him before he dies.

229
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,740
Don't you think that's self-serving?

230
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,040
I don't know all the messy details, but...

231
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:40,450
Does a parent who wants to see his
child before he dies need a reason?

232
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,830
Does a child need a reason
to see his parent?

233
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,150
Utsuzo...is Utsuzo here...?

234
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,810
Do a father and son need a reason?

235
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,600
They want to see each other's faces-isn't
that reason enough?

236
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,070
You're...a good man.

237
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,210
Hearing that from a guy doesn't
make me happy at all.

238
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,470
Sorry. Regardless of whether
he has his heart in a shell,

239
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,890
I'm dragging him shell
and all to his father.

240
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,850
Come on out. We're going to punch
your dying father in the face.

241
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,330
It opened?

242
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,460
Man, I give you credit for making
him open that door.

243
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,000
Is it time to change shifts?

244
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,520
Isn't it a little early?

245
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,920
A woman?

246
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,960
Who are you? Where's Utsuzo?

247
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,800
He's not here.

248
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,280
He left this world a long time ago.

249
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,450
Who...are you?

250
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,150
Where's Utsuzo?

251
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,560
He's not here.

252
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,090
He left this world a long time ago.

253
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:03,580
Man, your skills are top-notch... Looks
like I got caught by the wrong guy.

254
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,790
Damn you. What's going on here?!

255
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,130
I already told you. It's too late to
drag out the stupid son now.

256
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,930
Those guys are all idiots.

257
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,930
They haven't seen the guy or heard
his voice for five years-

258
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,800
how's he supposed to be still alive?

259
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,760
It's the Boss's fault.

260
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,930
Just when I thought his son went straight
and wasn't in my way anymore,

261
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,720
he goes and drags him back.

262
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,850
If the son's around I'll
never get my chance.

263
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,630
There was nothing I could do about it,

264
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,760
so I made sure he would never
come out of his shell.

265
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,380
No matter how much anyone called
out to him or yelled at him,

266
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,680
the Young Boss was never
going to come out.

267
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,830
I mean, all that's left inside
his shell are bones.

268
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,670
The Young Boss will forever
remain in his shell in here,

269
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,950
even if the Boss dies.

270
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,360
Too bad for the Boss, but he'll see
his precious son in the other world.

271
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,580
Was it you?

272
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,150
I'm asking you if you're the
one who killed Utsuzo.

273
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,390
Back then I looked after the Young Boss.

274
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,110
Even after he shut himself away, the
Young Boss would see only me.

275
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,750
It was a cinch to set things up.

276
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,640
It'd have been trouble if there was a fuss.

277
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,780
The foolish son won't come
out even though Boss dies.

278
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,550
The gang will need someone
to take his place, right?

279
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,570
That's right. You can't have the
unreliable heir take over.

280
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,030
You need someone with sharp
skills and a sharp mind.

281
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,570
A real yakuza.

282
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,320
You're no yakuza...

283
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,540
You're nothing but a scoundrel.

284
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,530
You...

285
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,420
Seems the poison is finally taking effect.

286
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,140
I was starting to think poison
doesn't work on a fool.

287
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,410
I guess the reason the sake tasted bad

288
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,410
wasn't only because it
was poured by a man.

289
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,660
Finish him.

290
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,400
Right!

291
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,980
Kill him!

292
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,920
Come back here!

293
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,220
Now you've done it...

294
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,750
Die!

295
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,870
Find him!

296
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,970
Drag the river if you have to, but find him!

297
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,090
Right!

298
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,850
Brother.

299
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,500
We just got a call from the hospital.

300
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,240
The Boss...

301
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,670
just died.

302
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,880
I see.

303
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,570
You did it. Everything is finally yours.

304
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,750
It's the start of the new Mashiroi...no,
the start of the Nakamura Gang.

305
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,430
We're leaving.

306
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,570
Huh?

307
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,580
That's enough diving
for sea sludge, guys.

308
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,690
Let's go home. He won't
survive those wounds.

309
