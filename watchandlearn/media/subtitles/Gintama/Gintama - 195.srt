A woman's heart is as changeable
as the autumn sky?

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,940
Pachinko's luck is as changeable
as the autumn sky is more like it.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,170
I was doing so well a moment ago.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,890
Ms. Ketsuno, Ana, has been off with
her weather forecasts lately.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,280
Maybe she should give up on the weather
and do forecasts for gambling luck.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,370
Excuse me...

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,740
Did you forget your umbrella?

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,000
Would you like to share mine?

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,050
But I'd feel bad.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,800
Please use this.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,460
Hey!

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,680
Hold on!

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,940
Wait up, lady.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,270
Hey, what are you doing?

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,220
It doesn't matter if I catch a cold.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,540
It matters. Leave a bad
taste in my mouth.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,750
It doesn't matter.

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,530
Since this is my fault.

20
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,070
What's your fault?

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,710
The weather's to blame, not you.

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,460
Hell, you might as well blame
the weather forecaster...

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,790
That's right.

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,300
It's my fault for giving an
inaccurate forecast.

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,420
K-K-Ke...

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,720
It'll be sunny today!

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,690
Ketsuno... Ana?!

["Not Losing to the Rain"]

29
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:08,720
The incredibly popular morning personality
with her dead-on forecasts,

30
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,390
weather lady Ketsuno has been
feeling under the weather.

31
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,880
After rattling off inaccurate
forecasts lately,

32
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,500
Ms. Christel Ketsuno has received
a multitude of complaints,

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,500
and she has finally stepped down
from her position on Wake Up TV.

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,830
What do you think?

35
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,820
I knew that there was something
wrong with her methods.

36
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,640
It's nonsense to rely on fortune telling in this
age of science to forecast the weather.

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,090
But I believe that her popularity was
not only because of her personality,

38
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,130
but because of the factor of uncertainty which comes
with using fortune telling to forecast the weather.

39
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,160
In fact, her black horoscopes were
known for their accuracy.

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,130
Rumor has it that since the dawn of the Bakufu, her
family has served and protected them as On...

41
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,250
You idiots!

42
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,950
I told you to turn off the TV
when we have guests!

43
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,640
You're the one who always
keeps it on, Gin-chan!

44
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,060
Gin-chan? Who's that?

45
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,360
He was killed in action long ago.

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,460
I told you to forget about him already!

47
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,000
Bring us some tea, fool!

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,380
Boo.

49
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,150
Sorry about all the chaos.

50
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,380
I actually have another twenty
or so employees.

51
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,990
They're all out working today so I've only
got dead weight to work with here.

52
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,870
We're moving to Roppongi Hills soon.

53
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,280
That's why the place is in disarray.

54
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,910
Oh, so we're upper class now.

55
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,960
That's amazing, Gin-san.

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,990
Didn't I say that Gin-san is dead?!

57
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,680
Call me President!

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,620
President, I say!

59
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,260
Hello, Sebastianita.

60
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,980
Where's the tea? The wine?

61
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,880
Didn't we have a 40s vintage bottle?

62
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,860
Here, President.

63
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,070
You're very welcome.

64
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,590
Hey, what is this?

65
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,350
Nilo.

66
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,220
Of all choices, why Nilo?!

67
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,980
This isn't like having some
classmates over!

68
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,750
Nilo is a delicious and healthy beverage that
both children and adults should drink.

69
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,320
That's only 'cause you like Nilo!

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,990
What, are you a spy for Nilo?!

71
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,920
Thank you very much.

72
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,780
Nilo is always delicious.

73
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,240
Right?

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,380
Isn't Nilo the best thing ever?

75
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,190
I apologize.

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,500
I had some 40s vintage Nilo ready,
but she messed it up...

77
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,670
Mild.

78
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,270
What the hell would 40s
vintage Nilo be like?

79
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,440
He's getting way too excited.

80
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,680
You can't blame him.

81
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Gin-san is a huge fan of Ms. Ketsuno.

82
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,760
He always had his eyes glued to the
screen for her weather forecast.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,170
I don't know how he managed to pick
her up, but what is he going to do?

84
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,260
Is she going to ask us to change the
weather so her forecasts are right?

85
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,670
That's impossible, even for us.

86
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,650
Ketsuno-san.

87
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:50,750
I'm sorry to say that it won't be possible
for us to change the weather for you.

88
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,510
But there is one thing we can do.

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,400
Your gloomy face...

90
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,710
We can clear it up for you.

91
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,700
President.

92
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,740
Sorry to point out, but there's no blinds.

93
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,090
Ketsuno-san, feel free
to tell us your worries.

94
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm sure we can put that
smile back on your face.

95
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,870
May I have another?

96
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,480
President.

97
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,300
Sorry to point out, but she isn't listening.

98
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,570
The Nilo has put a smile
back on her face.

99
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,390
I appreciate the thought.

100
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,410
There are still people cheering
me on after I've fallen apart.

101
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,790
Just knowing that is enough for me.

102
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,940
Why did you suddenly lose your
ability to forecast the weather?

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,310
I mean, the fact that you could predict the weather
through fortune telling was amazing enough...

104
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,900
But did something happen?

105
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,580
It's not an issue that can be
solved by talking about it.

106
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,820
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,770
So something did happen.

108
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,730
Please tell us.

109
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,120
I don't want to put you in danger.

110
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,220
Danger? What do you mean?

111
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,610
We definitely can't back
down after hearing that.

112
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,740
Ms. Ketsuno.

113
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,460
I don't care if your weather forecasts
are accurate or not.

114
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,210
I just wanted to see your smile.

115
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,400
Your smile gives me the strength
to make it through the day.

116
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,430
That was the only reason
I turned to your channel.

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,200
Day after day...

118
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,040
It's our turn now.

119
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,690
Will you let us help?

120
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,380
Is it really okay?

121
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,280
For me to take advantage
of your kindness?

122
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,380
You don't need to worry.

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,360
We're a lot tougher than we look.

124
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,180
A little danger won't be any problem...

125
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,390
Tsk! They've found me!

126
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,080
God of the eastern sea, Amei!

127
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,050
God of the western sea, Shukuryo!

128
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,100
God of the southern sea, Kyojo!

129
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,650
God of the northern sea, Gukyo!

130
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,300
Gods of the seas, repel the
fiends and halt this crisis!

131
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,440
Evil be gone!

132
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,580
Kyukyunyoritsuyou!

133
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,180
Um...

134
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,210
This is more or less what
you can expect.

135
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,130
Are you sure you're up for this?

136
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,770
Y-Yeah...

137
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,070
S-S-So this is what we can expect, huh?

138
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,300
Right, gotcha.

139
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,350
So we're dealing with this pattern.

140
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,520
Pattern B2.

141
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,410
I-I-It'll be fine, yeah?

142
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,060
Perfectly okay, yeah?

143
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,550
Uh-huh, pattern A3 might have been
a problem, but we can handle this.

144
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,500
We can handle this, yeah?

145
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,750
Hell no!

146
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,520
What is this?!

147
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,740
What was that monster?!

148
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,350
Why is the weather lady
fighting monsters?!

149
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,710
This has nothing to do with the weather!

150
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,000
You know that my weather forecasts are
done through fortune telling, right?

151
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,110
But in reality, I wasn't doing anything
soft like fortune telling.

152
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,460
The weather lady is my morning facade.

153
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,990
But I also have a different
identity at night.

154
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,390
Christel Ketsuno, the onmyoji.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,160
This would be the other side of me.

156
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,270
O-Onmyoji?!

157
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,080
The morning weather lady
is an onmyoji at night?!

158
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,650
Yes.

159
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,560
Since ancient times, onmyoji, through
the teachings of the Mahabhuta,

160
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,740
are experts of fortune telling through
divination, sorcery, and rituals.

161
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,160
In addition to revealing prophecy,

162
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,770
they were skilled sorcerers with the ability
conquer evil and stem disaster.

163
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:17,060
Ever since the Tokugawa shogunate
was established, my family,

164
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,500
the Ketsuno clan, has been employed by
the Bakufu as onmyoji to protect Edo.

165
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,370
Why?

166
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,640
Why is someone so amazing
working as a weather lady?

167
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,290
Why are you being attacked
by monsters?!

168
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,890
This monster is a shikigami, a sort
of familiar used by onmyoji.

169
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:45,790
In other words, an onmyoji sent this shikigami
to prevent you from assisting me.

170
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:54,920
And my ability to read the heavens has
also been repressed by an onmyoji.

171
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,970
Do you understand?

172
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:05,110
There is an onmyoji in Edo who doesn't
like the fact that I'm a weather lady.

173
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,530
And so, I will only be here a little longer,

174
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,090
but I'll do the best I can until then.

175
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,190
So please bear with me!

176
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,740
Thank you, Ms. Ketsuno.

177
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,100
Do the best you can this final week.

178
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,460
Could you give us today's weather
then, Ms. Ketsuno?

179
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,270
Today will be a sunny autumn day!

180
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,020
We've gotten into a crazy
mess, Gin-chan.

181
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,090
I never would have dreamed that
Ms. Ketsuno was an onmyoji...

182
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,950
And she's up against another onmyoji.

183
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,450
It's not for the Shogun or the Bakufu.

184
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,950
I...

185
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,380
I wish to use this power for the smiles
of the people in this town.

186
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,320
All right, let's get going.

187
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,710
Huh? Hold on a second.

188
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,130
Where are we?

189
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,910
The Ketsuno clan are established
family of elitists.

190
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,850
Yet one of their members chose
to become a weather lady,

191
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,150
a waste of her considerable power.

192
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,890
How do you think those stuffy
knuckleheads would feel?

193
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,810
You mean...?!

194
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,420
Let's go have a talk.

195
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,710
With those assholes

196
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,530
and their hemorrhoids!

197
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,960
Wait, Gin-san!

198
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,590
This is the Ketsuno clan residence?

199
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,190
You're going to encroach on the territory
of an elite clan of onmyoji?!

200
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,530
If you do that...

201
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,380
Who are you bugs?

202
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,020
You stepped in, knowing that this
was the Ketsuno clan's turf?!

203
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,440
I have no business with you tools.

204
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,180
Bring out the hemorrhoids.

205
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,570
Or you want me to squeeze
some white puss out of you?

206
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,470
Get the hell out of here
before we crush you!

207
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,870
Gin-san! This is bad!

208
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,290
We'll get killed for sure!

209
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,410
Let's leave for now!

210
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,340
Let's come back after we've
come up with a better plan!

211
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,040
Why are you getting so scared?

212
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,700
There's no need to worry.

213
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,730
Fight shikigami with shikigami.

214
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,220
I've got my own here.

215
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,340
That's...?

216
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,320
That can't be...?!

217
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,970
Ms. Ketsuno gave this
to me as a precaution.

218
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,880
It apparently contains one of the
shikigami under her control.

219
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,050
Really?!

220
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,500
Hey, fools.

221
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,840
You'd better scram now, since I won't
be showing any pity afterwards!

222
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,020
Come forth, Shikigami!

223
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,940
An intercom?

224
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,080
Aren't they usually supposed
to appear right away?

225
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,600
Hey, what are you doing?

226
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,670
Ah, sorry about that.

227
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,320
Could you... Could you
give us a moment?

228
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,580
Gin-chan, try pressing it again.

229
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,230
Come forth, Shikigami!

230
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,400
Yeah, this is definitely an intercom.

231
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,000
This is an intercom.

232
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,890
Hello?

233
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,160
There! Somebody picked up!

234
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,910
A shikigami?

235
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,730
Come forth, Shiki-

236
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,470
Ah, we already have a newspaper
subscription.

237
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,940
Uh, wait, no...

238
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,680
This isn't a sales pitch.
I'm asking for a shikigami...

239
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,300
Excuse me, but...

240
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,200
You are a shikigami, correct?

241
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,010
An, Nakasaki-kun?

242
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,900
Sorry, the shikigami is out right now.

243
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,680
Nakasaki?

244
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,690
Huh, you aren't the shikigami?

245
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,650
Returning a video to Sutaya, I think.

246
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:51,450
[Note: "Sutaya" is a play on "Tsutaya,"
a large video store chain.]

247
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,610
I'll tell her to call back when she returns.

248
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,450
Sutaya?

249
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,710
Huh? Who was that?

250
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,340
How many people are in this thing?

251
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,400
They have a Sutaya?

252
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,430
Sounded like the mom.

253
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,730
We can't do anything if the
shikigami isn't there.

254
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,760
Maybe the mom will do.

255
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,860
A shikigami's mom should
also be a shikigami, right?

256
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,700
Hey, what are you doing?

257
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,910
Move on already.

258
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,960
Ah, sorry about that.

259
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,830
One more time! Just one more time!

260
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,190
One last time then.

261
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,390
Hurry it up.

262
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,890
Hello?

263
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,690
Uh, sorry to bother you again.

264
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,780
I'm Sakata and I had an appointment
with the shikigami.

265
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,320
Ah, yes. Please wait one moment.

266
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,700
All right! I think she's here this time.

267
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,980
Hey, Father!

268
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,030
Father, take this call!

269
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,980
It's another one of those funny people!

270
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,710
Go tell him off!

271
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,110
Damn, you're loud...

272
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,420
Is it Nakasaki?

273
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,870
Him again? Cripes.

274
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,720
Hello? Whaddya want?

275
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,850
Ah, excuse me.

276
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,020
It's Sakata, not Nakasaki.

277
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,310
And I was wondering if the shikigami,
not the father, is around?

278
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,540
So you're the one who's been constantly
bugging our shikigami?

279
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,380
Will you cut it out?!

280
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,540
Uh, please listen to what I'm saying.

281
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,540
Sit tight. I'm coming to smack you silly!

282
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,980
Yes, please do.

283
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,960
The father will do.

284
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,350
Come on out already!

285
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,210
Hey!

286
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,650
Where are you going with that thing?!

287
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,500
Shut your trap!

288
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,770
I'm gonna deal with that Nakasaki
once and for all!

289
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,460
Stop it!

290
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,550
You'll get in trouble with the cops!

291
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,570
You wanna become a killer?!

292
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,870
You're the one who told
me to deal with him!

293
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,960
Now let me go!

294
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,220
I said to stop!

295
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,040
Calm down!

296
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,230
Hey, this sounds dangerous!

297
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,060
Are they okay?!

298
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,840
H-Hey...

299
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,100
Setsuko?

300
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,980
What's wrong?

301
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,420
Hey, Se-

302
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,970
Huh? What's happening?

303
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,330
Setsuko!

304
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,840
Hey! What happened?!

305
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,950
What's going on there?!

306
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,500
What's with all the drama?!

307
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,320
She's been stabbed!

308
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,600
They were grappling while he had a knife in
his hands and she ended up getting stabbed!

309
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,030
What?!

310
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,720
Hey! What are you doing?!

311
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,850
I don't know! I didn't do anything wrong!

312
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,030
Stop wasting time and summon
her so we can treat her!

313
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,180
Huh?! That's your concern?!

314
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,760
Uh, but they might be treating
her on the other side!

315
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,730
Shouldn't we avoid moving
her around too much?!

316
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,140
Just hurry it up!

317
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,100
Uh, please!

318
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,580
Someone answer!

319
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,770
Hello, this is the shikigami.

320
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,490
All right! The shikigami finally answered!

321
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,670
Hey, there's some real
trouble going down!

322
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,500
Though the trouble's on your side!

323
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,400
Come out immediately!

324
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,020
Come out with your mother immediately!

325
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,250
Understood.

326
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,130
Phew, we're safe now.

327
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,830
I apologize for the wait.

328
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,850
The shikigami, Gedomaru,

329
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,110
is here at your service.

330
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,730
Sh-She's in mourning!

331
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,870
Hey! We managed to summon
the shikigami,

332
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,960
but the timing was horrible!

333
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,640
The funeral?!

334
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,420
We called her out in the
middle of the funeral?!

335
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,750
And is that a picture of her mother?!

336
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,890
Did her mother end up dying?!

337
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,360
I have heard everything
from Lady Christel.

338
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,520
I am now Master Gintoki's servant
through blood pact.

339
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,450
Feel free to order me around
as you please.

340
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,980
Uh, sorry.

341
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,650
I find it really hard to order you around.

342
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,090
When your mind is clearly elsewhere.

343
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,440
You're clearly thinking
about your mother.

344
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,600
Please don't feel bad about what
happened to my mother.

345
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,470
I don't hold it against you.

346
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,710
Don't feel bad?!

347
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,170
Why is she making it sound
like this was my fault?!

348
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,040
It's fine.

349
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,070
You may be responsible
for my mother's death.

350
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,930
But I will fulfill my duty as a shikigami
and obey my master.

351
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,670
Don't make me sound
like the bad guy here!

352
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,780
I wasn't responsible for her death!

353
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,220
I didn't do anything wrong!

354
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,030
It's fine.

355
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,940
I don't mix personal and
business matters.

356
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
No, that's not the issue here!

357
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,120
I'll really be fine.

358
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,510
Now, feel free to order me
around as you please.

359
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,690
Mother...

360
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,530
I'll join you in a minute...

361
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,800
How am I supposed to
order you around?!

362
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,780
Huh? What is the problem?

363
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,620
Uh...

364
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,500
And yeah...

365
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,300
Won't it be hard to fight while
holding that portrait?

366
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,950
And I mean, it's really difficult for
me to give you commands...

367
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,180
You know...?

368
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,530
And it's pretty difficult for us to fight her.

369
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,750
Even if we're enemies, we aren't
completely heartless...

370
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,610
Why don't you set it down for now?

371
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,070
It should be okay to set it down
while you're fighting.

372
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,920
I could never place Mother
on the ground.

373
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,050
Then we'll hold it for you.

374
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,410
Uh, we'll place it in a proper location.

375
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,540
I apologize for the trouble.

376
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,020
Please take good care of Mother.

377
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,070
Don't worry about it.

378
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,320
It's rare to find such a daughter so devoted to
her parents, especially one who's an enemy.

379
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,940
If only my daughter were the same...

380
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,210
Your belly's

381
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,610
wide open!

382
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,190
Huh?!

383
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,070
Y-You bitch!

384
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,770
You tricked us?!

385
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,110
What a dirty trick...

386
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,910
Dirty?

387
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,210
Who do you think you're talking to?

388
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,190
I am the demon. Master of playing dirty.

389
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,830
Gedomaru.

390
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,080
Exorcism complete.

391
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,720
She's so cool!

392
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,290
She killed them in an instant!

393
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,000
An innocent little girl!

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,800
Against those huge shikigami!

395
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,470
And she killed them using
super dirty tricks!

396
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,060
Stop standing around and let's get going.

397
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,240
She stepped on it!

398
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,340
She stepped on the picture
of her mother!

399
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,720
Mother?

400
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,730
She died a thousand years ago.

401
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,790
It was all an act.

402
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,850
Act?!

403
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,150
Including the whole intercom bit?!

404
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,080
You were playing three
roles by yourself?!

405
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,940
This is a shock.

406
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,890
I thought you were going along
with my act to fool the enemy,

407
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,920
but you thought it was real?

408
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,910
Master Gintoki, I have a warning for you.

409
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:39,700
Shikigami are divided into loyal servants

410
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,030
and evil spirits, who are forced to
do the bidding of their master.

411
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,860
I would be the latter.

412
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,060
Caught by the Ketsuno clan when I was tearing
up Mt. Oe during the Heian period

413
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,430
and forced to serve them ever since.

414
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,740
I am just another demon.

415
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,470
If my master shows any signs of weakness,
I may simply turn on him.

416
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,280
It would be best if you don't forget

417
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,300
that I am always watching you.

418
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,860
U-Uh...

419
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,950
Anyone,

420
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,450
wanna be her master instead?

421
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,410
Hey! Wait!

422
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,470
I'm scared!

423
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,080
She's really scaring me!

424
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,470
Gedomaru.

425
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,220
You are a servant of the Ketsuno clan,

426
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,710
yet you have destroyed our shikigami
and trespassed on our territory.

427
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,990
You may be Lady Christel's shikigami,
but these actions cannot be forgiven!

428
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,510
Th-That's?!

429
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,030
The Ketsuno clan?!

430
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:46,340
I no longer belong to Lady Christel.
I am this man's servant.

431
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,880
It is not my place to question
what my master does.

432
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,840
Huh?!

433
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,500
Could you be from the Shirino clan?!

434
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,340
Na maḥ sa maṃ ta va jrā nāṃ caṃ ḍa ma
hā ro ṣa ṇa spho ṭa ya huuṃ traṭ hāṃ māṃ.

435
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,850
Flames of Acala Vidyaraja!

436
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,380
Incinerate all evil!

437
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,100
Gedomaru! Do some-

438
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,150
Why are you hiding behind me?!

439
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,540
Did we get them?

440
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,760
That is enough.

441
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,150
These people are friends of Christel.

442
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,710
A friend of Christel is a friend of mine.

443
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,520
I will not permit any further
mistreatment of our guests.

444
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,410
Or my name isn't Seimei.

rescued Gin-san and the gang?]
