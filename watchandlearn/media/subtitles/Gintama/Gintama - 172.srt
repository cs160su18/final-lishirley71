2
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,420
Prisoner 3-2034.

3
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,420
Kohei Tanaka.

4
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,020
A vicious serial killer who murdered
35 Bakufu employees.

5
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,460
Also known as Kohei the Manslayer, a leader in the
Akatsuki faction of the radical Anti-Foreigner Faction.

6
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,150
Surrounded by over forty Bakufu officials,
with a dozen cuts on his body,

7
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,780
he didn't bat an eye as
he killed seven officials.

8
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,170
After being captured, he has
yet to respond to torture,

9
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,070
and we haven't been able to
get him to open his mouth.

10
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,080
No, that would be the
wrong way to put it.

11
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,160
His mouth is definitely open.

12
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,180
In fact, it's been open the whole time.

13
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,290
He never stops smiling, regardless
of the torture he's going through.

14
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,840
He's always smiling like
he's enjoying it all.

15
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:38,670
["It All Depends On How You Use
The 'Carrot and Stick' Method"]

16
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,680
The suits have given us
a real pain to deal with.

17
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,350
There have been reports of a large-scale terrorist
attack in the works by the Akatsuki faction.

18
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,590
He must know the details.

19
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,320
And we're supposed to
force it out of him?

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,560
Yeah, pretty much.

21
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,440
Can you do it?

22
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,490
I doubt we'll be able to make
him talk through torture.

23
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,160
Look at that masochistic face.

24
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,610
Does he look like someone in a desperate situation
after being captured by the enemy?

25
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,000
He isn't thinking about how
to get out of this situation.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,670
He's enjoying the situation.

27
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,830
He must have been trained
to take torture.

28
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,340
He doesn't reject pain.

29
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,450
He's probably learned
to seek and relish it.

30
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,520
We could cut off an arm or leg,

31
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,200
and he would keep on smiling like that.

32
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,050
So it's impossible to pressure
him through pain.

33
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,180
Still, what do we do, Toshi?

34
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,360
There's more to an interrogation
than going on the attack.

35
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,450
We'll use the "carrot and stick"
technique to make him talk.

36
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,570
Lose the mindset of forcing
information from him.

37
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,870
We're going to get close
to him and snatch it.

38
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,600
So you want to win him over...

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,710
How exactly are we supposed to
get a serial killer to warm up?

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,800
If someone like him had been in my class, I
wouldn't have wanted to be friends with him.

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,140
I would have graduated without
saying a word to him.

42
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,900
It's fine.

43
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,980
When you're about to graduate, the people
you couldn't stand all look like nice people.

44
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,000
Uh, how is it fine?

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,690
What are we graduating from?

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,630
Hijikata-san, this is your chance
to make a friend.

47
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,510
Do you intend to end three years of school
without ever lifting your head off your desk?

48
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,840
Don't talk about me like I'm
some sorry, lonely guy!

49
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,590
You'll never make any friends if you
aren't willing to approach anyone.

50
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,670
Physical exams are a great time
to try, with everybody hyped up.

51
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,250
"Oh? You wear briefs?"

52
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,790
You know, something along those lines.

53
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,570
Who are you accusing
of wearing briefs?!

54
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,290
Go for it!

55
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,860
Be brave, Toshi!

56
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,160
Open his heart!

57
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,380
Open his briefs, Toshi!

58
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,900
Hey! Why are you trying to
push the dirty work on me?!

59
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,340
Yamazaki, you go.

60
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,280
You wear briefs, right?

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,630
Get going.

62
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,930
No, I wear boxers!

63
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,790
Shut up.

64
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,540
You might as well be wearing briefs.

65
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,900
You ooze lameness...

66
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,350
No, wait...

67
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,660
We don't even know if he wears briefs...

68
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,830
Stop wasting time and get going!

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,910
Open!

70
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,740
Open his briefs, Zaki!

71
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,700
Ow-ow-ow...

72
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,120
S-Scary!

73
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,090
This guy's really creepy up close!

74
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,310
Like he's going to jump me at any time!

75
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,950
Zaki, carrot and stick.

76
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,390
Mercilessly pressure him, while offering
gentle words of comfort.

77
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,470
Use the tsundere principle
to catch his heart!

78
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,100
[Note: A character archetype, where a rough person suddenly becomes sweet, under certain circumstance.]

79
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,840
Calm down.

80
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,990
His arms and legs are chained
together so he can't move.

81
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,340
And everybody's watching me through
the two-way mirror behind me.

82
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,800
I'll start with a threat.

83
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,830
He's looking down on the police.

84
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,720
I won't be able to accomplish anything if
I can't get that smug smile off his face!

85
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,230
Fuck it, patchwork baldy!

86
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,220
How long you gonna keep playin' it cool?

87
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,120
Don't mess with the police, mothafucka!

88
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,230
We don't have all day here!

89
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,190
The anime's on its fourth year, with our
stock of original material running out!

90
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,130
We get manga manuscripts
faxed over every week!

91
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,960
We're on the ropes!

92
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,050
Everybody's stressed out to the limit!

93
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,010
We don't got time to waste on
a guest character like you!

94
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,490
So cut to the chase and spill your guts!

95
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,600
What's he talking about?

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,980
[Note: Refers to the recently released "Dragon Quest IX".]

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,980
I wanna play DQ too!

98
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,020
I haven't beaten it yet!

99
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,160
But I'm sucking it up and
working my ass off!

100
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,180
I have to deal with people like you
instead of doing what I want to do!

101
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,960
Hey, isn't he just bitching now?

102
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,650
Damn it!

103
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,510
Why can't I get a job like the one
Kochikame's Akimoto has?!

104
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,510
[Note: Osamu Akimoto is the manga artist of "Kochikame (Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Koen Mae Hashutsujo)," a very popular police manga/anime.]

105
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,610
What is he doing?

106
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,230
He's not even looking at the suspect.

107
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,620
He's just channeling the author
of this manga now.

108
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,480
I watched Binetsu Tairiku!

109
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,480
[Note: Binetsu Tairiku is a parody of the Japanese TV show "Jyonetsu Tairiku."]

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,570
I was all pumped up to
work after watching it,

111
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,300
so I sat down at my desk,
but it was no good!

112
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,570
I can't be like you! I'm worthless!

113
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,230
Yeah, we don't care.

114
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,380
Cut it out.

115
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,170
This isn't a place for Sorachi to repent.

116
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,830
[Note: Hideaki Sorachi= original
manga author for Gintama.]

117
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,140
I'm just... I'm just...

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,840
This is the theme from Binetsu Tairiku...

119
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,230
The Taro song...

120
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,000
You...

121
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,560
You are certainly a failure of a human.

122
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,080
What?

123
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,710
Like you're one to talk.

124
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,090
I'm not referring to your
tardy work habits.

125
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,820
I'm talking about how you gaze at the
top of the mountain in servitude.

126
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,740
The path to the top will only grow
longer if you belittle yourself.

127
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,770
A mountain peak does not exist
to show how small you are.

128
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,190
It's there to provide you with a goal.

129
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,030
If you have to wander down a side path,

130
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,130
you should take your time
to slowly climb up.

131
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,160
The mountain you call Akimoto-san
was the product of thirty years.

132
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:15,320
[Note: Tanaka is using a mountain metaphor to describe the Kochikame manga artist. "Kochikame" has been in Weekly Shonen Jump since 1976. ]

133
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,320
It won't be an easy climb for you.

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,880
You must be prepared
to spend thirty years.

135
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,770
Step by step, as steady as a turtle...

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,770
[Note: Part of the manga title "Kochikame"
is "kame", which is turtle.]

137
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,720
It's possible that you'll
never reach the top.

138
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,650
You may burn out halfway.

139
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:37,210
However, you'll still have a better
view than you do now.

140
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,190
Thank you very much.

141
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,300
If you'll excuse me.

142
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,180
What did you go in there for?!

143
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,970
Why did you fall for his carrot?!

144
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,880
Why did you let him use
the stick on you?!

145
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,380
Why were you the one
who spilled his guts?!

146
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,240
You're supposed to get the
suspect to spill his guts!

147
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,830
Still, I was able to get close to him.

148
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,690
He burned me a DVD of Binetsu Tairiku.

149
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,460
He's the one who won you over!

150
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,680
Hey, Yamazaki.

151
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Lend me that.

152
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,850
Now, I'll always be able
to see the rare scene,

153
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,130
where the interviewers ask kind Mr. Akimoto
what he's most angry about right now,

154
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:17,820
[Note: Refers to the documentary Jyonetsu Tairiku (Passionate Continent - Documentary). Osamu Akimoto was featured in February 2009.]

155
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,820
and he gives his long answer in the interview.

156
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,360
How could you enjoy that?!

157
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,890
It must have been a really long interview
to make Mr. Akimoto say that.

158
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,210
Rewatch the part where he's
interviewing the interviewers!

159
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,210
Yamazaki, you let him
pull a fast one on you.

160
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't believe you let yourself
be lectured by that murderer.

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,480
Pathetic...

162
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,680
He'll be a tough nut to crack.

163
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,730
Okay. I'll go next.

164
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,370
That's enough threatening.

165
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,840
I'll go with carrot.

166
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,590
[Note: Parody of the police TV drama "Hagure Keiji
Jyunjyo-ha (Rogue Detective Naïve Type).]

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,590
Just like the rogue detective.

168
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,130
Detective Gorilla: Empathy Type.

169
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,130
I'll use empathy to sway him over.

170
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,960
It says Detective Gorilla. You're a gorilla.

171
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,440
You've strayed from the human race.

172
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,260
Chief, take care of my daughters
if anything happens to me.

173
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,230
Where's the chief or your daughters?

174
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,190
Detective Kane.

175
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:19,260
[Note: Parody of Kane Kosugi, the son of martial art star Sho Kosugi. He appeared in many physical challenge shows.]

176
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,730
You should learn to act
before you learn action.

177
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,260
Yeah, whatever happened
to Detective Kane?

178
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,860
You're probably sick of the prison slop.

179
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,930
I've brought you something
special today.

180
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,070
Eat as much as you want.

181
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,560
It's Gorilla's special katsudon.

182
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,560
[Note: Katsudon (Fried pork cutlet and egg on rice) is often used in Japanese police TV dramas as a prop to convince hungry suspects.]

183
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,520
The katsudon might be
considered empathetic,

184
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,230
but the way he's feeding
it to him is anything but.

185
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,110
Eat up.

186
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,360
The exact opposite, in fact.

187
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,690
All right now...

188
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,050
Fact is, I have a son your age.

189
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,480
Hey, Detective Gorilla!

190
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,870
How old are you supposed to be?!

191
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,750
That makes your son an old man!

192
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,180
You remind me of my son.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,660
I wonder where he is now...

194
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,520
He said something about studying
action in America...

195
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,590
How did Detective Kane
become your son?!

196
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,000
There was a period when he
went down the wrong path...

197
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,310
He'd be immersed in dangerous
bodybuilding shows every night

198
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:21,310
[Note: Kinniku Banzuke (Muscle ranking) and SASUKE are names of physical challenge shows in Japan.]

199
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,310
like Muscle Ranking and SASUKE...

200
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,160
Yeah, that sure is dangerous, but...

201
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,390
Murofushi, Shoei...

202
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:29,660
[Note: Koji Murofushi is a Japanese gold medalist hammer thrower who appeared in the 2004 Olympics. Shoei is a Japanese actor who competed on Sasuke in early 2000s.]

203
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,210
Those were the nameless muscle
freaks he joined with,

204
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,660
as they snorted muscles,

205
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,780
and raced around in stolen muscles.

206
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,780
[Note: Kondo is using "muscle" in
lieu of "drug" and "motorcycle".]

207
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,370
It was awful...

208
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,350
What the hell are stolen muscles?!

209
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,130
How would that work?!

210
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,500
Eventually, my wife collapsed
because of her muscles.

211
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,340
What?!

212
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
You're not even making any sense now!

213
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,850
Enough! Enough about Detective Kane!

214
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,210
She must have been worried
about our son's muscles...

215
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,520
Stop talking about muscles!

216
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,940
But our son never came to the hospital,
despite his mother's condition.

217
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,220
He had been locked up in the slammer!

218
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,100
Hey!

219
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,200
Why are you giving Kane
a criminal record?!

220
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,400
Illegal possession of muscles.

221
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,430
[Note: Kondo is using Muscle to refer to drugs here. Yukio Iketani is a gymnast and Olympic medalist.]

222
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,430
He'd been secretly growing
Iketani in his closet.

223
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,270
How would that even work?!

224
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,260
He might have avoided arrest if
it had been the younger Iketani,

225
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,130
but the older Iketani assures
you of a sentencing.

226
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,070
[Note: The Iketani brothers. Yukio Iketani and his younger brother, Naoki Iketani are both gymnasts.]

227
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,590
What's the difference?

228
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,140
I was enraged, despondent...

229
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,880
I considered cutting ties with him.

230
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,550
How could I call him my son when
he hadn't come to see his mother

231
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,650
on her deathbed because
of his muscle addiction!

232
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:42,640
But as I sat there in despair
and regret, my wife told me.

233
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,860
Don't run away.

234
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,450
If it's the duty of a parent to praise a child
and rejoice when he does something right,

235
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:02,170
it's also the duty of a parent to curse and
mourn when he does something wrong!

236
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,290
Once my son was released, I beat him
to a pulp... Till he almost died...

237
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,350
However, when he repented his
old ways and stood up,

238
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,080
I embraced him as tight as I
could... Till he almost died...

239
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,690
It's the job of a parent to accept their
child, no matter what they become.

240
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,890
However, no parent would
want to hate their child.

241
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,610
If it's the parent's responsibility
to love and hate their child,

242
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,750
what is the child's responsibility?

243
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,180
I'll make this simple.

244
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,110
Don't make your parents suffer.

245
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,090
Please don't make them go
through what my wife did.

246
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,520
You have committed many sins.

247
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,640
It's too late for you to erase them.

248
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,600
Your parents will have to bear that
burden for the rest of their lives.

249
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,570
But there are still sins that
you can make up for.

250
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,320
It's still possible for you to lessen
the burden on your parents!

251
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,890
I'll spill...

252
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,880
I'll spill everything...

253
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,560
You...

254
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,440
D-Don't tell me he actually
convinced that murderer?!

255
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,250
Did you see that, Toshi?! Sogo?!

256
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,500
It's all about heart!

257
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,970
My heartfelt carrot was able to
soften this hardened criminal!

258
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,580
Touch this killer deep down...

259
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,340
He spilled something else!

260
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,650
[Note: Spoof of Police drama TV series "Taiyo ni hoero! (Howl to the sun!)" from the 70-80's. G-pan(Jeans pants) detective played by Yusaku Matsuda died in the series using this line.]

261
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,400
What the hell is this?!

262
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,650
Why did this turn into a Detective
G-Pan death scene?!

263
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,600
Weren't you a rogue detective?!

264
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,770
Why are they playing the death music from Howl
to the Sun for a scene where he got barfed on?!

265
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,370
Ah, I'm sorry.

266
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,450
I believe this katsudon is spoiled?

267
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,000
H-Hold on...

268
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,030
It hasn't spoiled yet.

269
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,190
Please wait...

270
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,630
Don't throw this away...

271
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,660
It's only three days old!

272
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,010
I was saving it to eat later!

273
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,300
No, the katsudon's definitely spoiled.
So is your head, for that matter.

274
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,980
Forgive me.

275
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,450
After you went through the trouble
to prepare that for me, well...

276
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,670
I'll take responsibility
by eating all of it,

277
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,300
so please leave it here.

278
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,490
What the hell is this?!

279
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,320
Wait... Please wait!

280
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,450
Don't take this from me!

281
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,010
Don't overdo it!

282
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,170
I don't want to become a killer!

283
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,820
Hey, could you drop the
crappy imitation?

284
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,340
Please set your mind at ease.

285
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,020
You've done nothing wrong.

286
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,240
I have faith in you.

287
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,660
If it's the parent's duty to
bear the child's sins,

288
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,330
the "friend" should take the duty of having
faith and fighting by your side.

289
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Gorilla-san!

290
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,850
Weren't you going for G-Pan?!

291
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,990
What happened to the rogue detective?!

292
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,850
Gori-san! Hang in there!

293
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,250
Hey!

294
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,670
He got me...

295
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,490
I was soundly defeated...

296
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,710
After I suspected him and
fed him this pig feed...

297
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,090
He called me friend... He
still believed in me...

298
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,960
Yeah, why a pork cutlet?

299
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,620
Shouldn't that be a cigarette?!

300
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:04,100
[Note: Spoof of Police drama TV series "Taiyo Ni Hoero! (Howl to the sun!)". Each detective was given a nickname for the way they dress and their personality.]

301
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,390
Detective Mayora...

302
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,420
Detective Sadist...

303
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,100
The rest is up to you...

304
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,360
Gori-san!

305
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,300
What's going on?

306
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,250
Our attempt to convince that murderer

307
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,000
is backfiring...

308
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,640
Hijikata-san...

309
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,100
He seems to be much better than
us at using carrot and stick.

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,620
Your concept of carrot and stick

312
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,230
[?-chan, you're too close!]

313
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,240
is basically where someone who's
always beating you from behind

314
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,030
[It's embarrassing when people are watching]

315
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,990
[What~ That's not true~]

316
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,240
[On the other hand]

317
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,490
[Geez, I can't believe you, stupid ?-kun]

318
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
says something kind or righteous,

319
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,990
[Sorry, XX-chan...]

320
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,720
you appreciate it more than if it
came from someone normal.

321
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,000
[I love you, ?-kun]

322
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,760
What you might call the gap principle.

323
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,000
What's with the really dumb visual aids?

324
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
[...is more of a turn-on]

325
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,720
However...

326
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,890
What? We're not done with
these weird visuals?

327
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,600
He's already known to be a vicious killer,

328
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,230
so you could say that we've already
experienced his stick.

329
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,890
By the time we try to give him the stick,

330
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,770
he's already finished.

331
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,020
[Mr. Akimoto is wonderful...!!!]

332
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,860
He just has to spew some
nice-sounding crap,

333
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,650
[Oh... My friend...]

334
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,650
to accomplish the carrot and stick effect.

335
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,070
We will always be behind in the score,

336
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,280
which is why we aren't
getting any results.

337
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,430
If we want to win, we have to achieve
carrot and stick before he does.

338
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,160
Can we do that?

339
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,340
It's impossible to do it alone.

340
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,780
But...

341
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,190
I see!

342
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,150
Don't make yourself too comfortable!

343
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,600
Your torture's about to start!

344
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,060
A top-class sadist who's aiming
for his superior's life!

345
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,440
And...

346
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,720
Are you okay?!

347
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,820
Are you hurt?!

348
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,820
The follow-up master who cleans up after
superiors and subordinates alike!

349
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,650
If the two of us work together,

350
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,090
we can form the best carrot and stick!

351
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,750
Now...

352
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,790
It's over.

353
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,410
Uh, sorry...

354
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,100
What are you doing?

355
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,110
Wh-What?!

356
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,000
Carrot and stick isn't working!

357
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,200
Impossible!

358
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,560
That should have been a clean hit!

359
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,650
Are you okay?

360
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,690
Why don't you have a
seat so we can talk?

361
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:40,020
I was feeling lonely because
everybody had gone.

362
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,620
A murderer feeling lonely...?!

363
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,680
This guy has brought out
a real carrot bomb!

364
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,430
We can't hold him off!

365
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,760
Hijikata-san!

366
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,290
We've had this completely
wrong from the beginning!

367
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,010
Think back!

368
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,080
This guy is a masochist!

369
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,020
Which means a normal carrot
and stick won't work on him!

370
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,870
I-I see!

371
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,220
A masochist won't feel any
pain from the stick!

372
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,150
So his carrot would be the stick!

373
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,280
We had the order wrong!

374
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,540
Using the stick and then carrot in that
order didn't have any effect on him!

375
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:35,300
We have to hit him with
the carrot, then the stick!

376
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,490
No, wait...

377
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,330
My carrot shouldn't have
lost its effect yet.

378
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,100
Which means we need one more...

379
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,430
One more lash with the stick to
complete our carrot and stick!

380
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,580
But he's so far away...

381
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,410
I'm losing my will to fight...

382
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,030
It's no use...

383
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,920
I can no longer...

384
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,350
fight...

385
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,090
Toshi.

386
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,470
Toshi...

387
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,110
Toshi!

388
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,470
Toshi!

389
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,580
Vice-Chief!

390
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,640
You guys!

391
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,670
I can...

392
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,350
I can feel power surging through me!

393
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,130
I see...

394
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,800
Carrot and stick isn't
limited to the enemy.

395
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,090
Our plight was the stick.

396
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,010
And the comrades who are able
to rise up out of this plight

397
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,350
serve as the greatest carrot!

398
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,640
Go!

399
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,440
Uh, this might be a bad
time to interrupt you all.

400
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,090
Uh, there was a mistake.

401
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,890
That person isn't Kohei Tanaka.

402
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,460
He's not a killer either.

403
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,670
He's Kahei Tanaka, a good citizen
who helped catch a shoplifter.

404
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,730
He crashed into a store window when he
caught the shoplifter, and hurt himself.

405
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,920
so we brought him to the
station to get treatment,

406
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,590
but there was a mix-up since
his name was similar.

407
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,260
I'm really sorry about this.

408
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,230
I'll bring the real Kohei now.

409
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,080
Combine the carrot with the stick...

410
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,310
My katsudon is starting to spoil...

411
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,530
Mr. Akimoto works so hard...

412
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,690
He was just a smiling nice person...

413
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,710
What the hell is this?!

Uh, Eli, was that how you always looked?

416
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,960
Was that how you always were?
