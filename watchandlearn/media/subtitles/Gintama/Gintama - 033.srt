Let's see... This question comes from Anonymous-san of Chiba prefecture.

8
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,370
In "Gin Tama," Hasegawa and Kondo are called "ossan."

9
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:19,240
[Ossan = a middle-aged man in Kansai dialect, but recently has become slang to mean the same thing]

10
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,420
But Gin-san and Hijikata, who are nearly the same age, aren't middle-aged.

11
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,240
So, just when do guys start being called an "ossan"?

12
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,070
Yes, let me answer that.

13
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,960
It's when the pillow you're using starts to smell like your father.

14
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,130
Hey, who's been using my pillow without my permission?! It smells like an "ossan."

15
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,340
That's what you smell like, idiot.

16
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,200

We're trying to fix Odd Jobs, right?

All I hear are the sounds of fingers and the house being destroyed.

36
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,950
Creation and destruction are two sides of the same coin, Shinpachi-kun.

By any chance, did Sakamoto-san ask you to come?

That's right! When we get a call, we go! No matter how far!

I bet you can only make houses out of candy.

139

Oh, but then again, it's candy. That's not so bad...

Don't be shocked, but...

141

Do you know the mighty Terminal building, the symbol of Japan's might, which made Edo an international city?

142

That terminal... Inside there...

143
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,090
You know that cupboard for ladles in the kitchen?

144
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,300
We made those!

145
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,880
Even when you close the door, they don't come crashing down.

146
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,920
That's lame. I made a bookshelf out of milk cartons.

147
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,800
And it's environmentally friendly.

148
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,400
So? You think something like that is going to save the Earth?

149
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,350
Who cares about the Earth, it's more like we don't have money.

150
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,130
Yeah, we've got a tight household budget!

151

What the heck are you guys talking about?

152
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,780
It can't get any worse. Let's have them do it.

153
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,840
Besides, it looks like Sakamoto-san already paid them.

154
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,080
Do you know this saying?

155
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,240
It's something a carpenter named Mokichi once said...

156
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,270
"Craftsmen who talk a lot are never good."

157
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,830
A good craftsman hardly even knows how to use his mouth.

158
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,190
He lets his hands do the talking.

159
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,570
Which kind are you guys?

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,210
What's all that racket?

161
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,040
Is it them... Hm?

162
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,950
That punk burns me up!

We'll show him who the best carpenters in the universe are!

165
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,170
Who the heck are those guys?

166
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,930
A-Amazing.

167
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,630
They fixed everything in just a day...

168
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Take a look. The interior's perfect too.

169
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,620
These are the skills of the best carpenters in the universe!

170
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,660
Awesome! They really are skilled carpenters.

171
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,440
Gin-san, isn't that terrific? We're back in business again.

172
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,780
Something's not right.

173
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,180
I don't remember Odd Jobs being this bleak.

174
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,610
It's not our fault you can't afford furniture!

175
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,380
We haven't touched the original structure.

176
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,100
No, no, no...

177
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,290
It's not that.

178
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,290
Something's missing. Um...

179
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,380
Oh, I know.

180
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,380
I thought it looked dreary...

181
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,470
The chandelier is gone!

182
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,460
Chandelier?

183
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,930
What do you mean, "chandelier"?

184
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,350
Wouldn't a chandelier look funny in a traditional Japanese interior?!

185
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,090
Come to think of it, did we have something like that?

186
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm sure we did. You just never looked at the ceiling. You must've forgotten.

187
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,100
Now that you mention it, I remember there was one.

188
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,330
And, what happened to the stairs to the third floor?

189
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,200
The third floor?

190
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,570
We had that? I never heard about that!

191
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,580
Oh yeah, you guys may not know about it. It used to be above the dresser.

192
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,330
The third floor was for my JUMP collection.

193
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,450
Are you serious?

194
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,450
Also, my room looks weird. It wasn't this small.

195
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:52,520
[Note: Tatami mats are units to measure floor space.]

196
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,240
Don't mess with me. The floor was enough for 30 Tatami mats.

197
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,890
Thirty mats?

198
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,520
That closet was thirty mats?

199
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,990
That's bigger than the whole room!

200
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,160
Kagura, isn't that pushing it a bit much?

201
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,230
Okay, then I'll compromise at twenty mats.

202
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,730
I've never heard such an unreasonable compromise!

203
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:09,110

204
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,120
Also, the toilet. I'm pretty sure there was a shower toilet in there.

205
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,110
Also the bathroom wall was all glass. It had a more erotic feel to it.

206
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,300
Oh, I remember, too. And there was a karaoke machine in the living room.

207
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,140
Hang on there. We never even touched the living room! That should be the way it was.

208
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,690
Have you ever heard this story?

209
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,900
Long ago...

210
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,450
There were two carpenters who vied to be the most popular carpenters in Edo...

211
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,830
One was a millionaire's son, who was skilled and also well off. His name was Gohei.

212
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,440
The other was odd and boasted that as long as he could drive a nail, he'd never want for food-Mokichi.

213
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,850
Mokichi had no interest in worldly success, but Gohei was different.

214
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,970
Every day, Gohei schemed to get rid of Mokichi so that he could be the most popular in Edo.

215
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,250
Before long, Mokichi's reputation began to wane. Gohei was behind this.

216
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,310
He pulled in all his connections and stuck Mokichi with all the worst jobs.

217
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,590
Mokichi had all the impossible and difficult jobs forced on him,

218
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,230
and eventually, Mokichi was no longer able to find work.

219
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,070
Exactly as Gohei had planned.

220
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,820
Mokichi's popularity dwindled rapidly and Gohei's day had come...

221
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,580
Or so it seemed... But suddenly Mokichi's troubles just dissolved.

222
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,750
Several years later, Mokichi's popularity surpassed that of Gohei's and

223
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,760
he was indisputably the top carpenter in Edo.

224
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,100
You probably want to know why.

225
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,720
Gohei wanted to know, too.

226
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,060
You bastard, what kind of dirty trick did you pull?

227
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,920
Weren't you getting forced to do all the impossible jobs?

228
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,290
Mokichi replied...

229
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,100
You're right.

230
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,160
And it was difficult work, but it taught me more than I've ever known about carpentry.

231
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,810
I sure am grateful it happened.

232
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,310
Mokichi's the bomb!

233
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,130
Mokichi probably didn't realize he was being tricked.

234
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,940
He loved carpentry so much that he welcomed the challenge!

235
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,910
Isn't that what it means to be a craftsman?

236
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,520
Dammit!

237
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,120
That punk burns me up!

238
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,370
Brother!! No matter how you look at it,

239
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,020
they're playing us!

240
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,080
Like marionettes on a string!

241
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,890
I know! I know, but I can't stop. He's got my carpenter's blood heated up!

242
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,020
Brother! Me, too! What is this feeling?

243
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,460
Was this how Mokichi felt?

244
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,570
Mokichi!!

245
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,600
Who's Mokichi?

246
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,350
How's that? You son of a bitch!

247
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,720
You've got no complaints now!

248
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,590
Witness the work of the greatest carpenters in the universe!

249
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,130
Wow! That's amazing. They even made a third floor, too.

250
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,350
My room hasn't changed at all! What's the meaning of this?

251
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,850
Wow, you two are pretty good.

252
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,240
All right, then!

253
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,740
We'll be going now.

254
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,890
Hey, what about my room?

255
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,110
Well, there's still the outside.

256
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,840
Outside?

257
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,650
O-Outside? We already did the outside!

258
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,590
Yeah, you didn't say anything about that before!

259
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,590
Hey, what about my room? Don't ignore me!

260
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,590
No, but there's still something missing... The Odd Jobs was more...

261
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,210
More like this...

262
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,050
Hey, that is beyond missing something!

263
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,570
That's totally different.

264
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,990
That's the Parthenon.

265
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,440
That's right. Like the "Parthemom."

266
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,340
You showed us that without even knowing what the Parthenon is?!

267
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,850
That's lame!

268
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,640
It looked like this! This one!

269
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,220
That's the Castle in the Sky!

270
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,050
[Note: "Castle in the Sky" is a popular anime film by Hayao Miyazaki.]

271
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,580
That would be a trademark violation!!

272
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,050
This is pointless. We're leaving!

273
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,020
All right.

274
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,810
Okay, fine. You can leave it as is. Just make it fly.

275
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,490
Make it so it flies when you push a button, you buttheads.

276
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,440
That's the biggest problem!

277
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,990
In what world have you ever seen a house that flies when you push a button?

278
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,470
Generally speaking, in the world of animation, when you push a button, things work out somehow.

279
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,750
That's right. All you do is just push a button for everything.

280
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,580
I'm getting tired of this.

281
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,790
Really, we're leaving...

282
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,280
Hey, did you ever hear this story...?

283
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,240
Dammit!!

284
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
That young punk's so annoying!

285
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,520
We already used up all the money that Sakamoto guy gave us a long time ago!!

286
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,200
But still... What a shock that Mokichi had such a secret in his past!

287
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,660
Yeah, who can say no after hearing that!

288
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,890
Kaikei! That must mean we have the same heart as Mokichi.

289
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,300
You think so, Brother? We're the same as him?

290
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,870
Mokichi!!

291
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,130
Like I was saying, who is Mokichi?

292
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,300
Brother...it's already morning... Just a little bit more...

293
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,490
Brother?

294
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,320
Let's take a break. I'll go get us some coffee.

295
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,210
You can't do good work by pushing yourself too hard.

296
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,550
Speed isn't everything.

297
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,110
But...

298
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,930
I'm sure Mokichi had a coffee or two

299
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,160
as he took pleasure in watching his work being completed.

300
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,130
While working, you reflect upon...

301
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,250
...the joy your work gives you.

302
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,640
Isn't that what being a craftsman is all about?

303
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,800
Brother! I just got goosebumps when I heard that!

304
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,750
Kaikei! We have but one goal!

305
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,020
Mokichi!!

306
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,520
So who is this Mokichi?

307
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,250
Mokichi? He doesn't exist.

308
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,330
I just made him up.

309
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,890
Are you serious?

310
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,800
Those two are so easy to fool.

311
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,140
But...if they ever find out, they'll be really mad.

312
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,900
I think it's best if we keep it to ourselves.

313
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,360
Don't worry about it.

314
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,680
They're stupid enough to seriously buy into that story.

315
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,740
I'm sure they won't figure it out...

316
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,180

What?! Are you serious, Brother?

319

You're saying Mokichi never existed?

That's right.

321

That's why we're leaving, Kaikei!

Humph... Like I would ever come back to this planet again!

326
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,890
But Brother... Was it okay to just leave in the middle of a job?

327
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,480
Who cares? We worked hard for them and they toyed with our emotions.

328

Come on, don't say that... There must be some misunderstanding.

What?

334
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,080
Whether or not Mokichi existed is not the point.

335
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,780
That's totally irrelevant.

...lives inside the souls of craftsmen like you guys...

Mokichi, you're the best!

Who can say no after hearing that?!

347
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,540
Kaikei! I don't understand! Did Mokichi really exist or not?

348
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,690
It doesn't matter, Brother. It's all in our souls.

349
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,860
Whether he actually existed or not, Mokichi lives inside of us!

All right, Kaikei! Let's do this.

Good morning. I'm Atsunosuke Watanabe.

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,630
Today, here in Kabukicho, Edo's business and shopping district,

361
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,300
we will be visiting the home of Gintoki Sakata who runs Odd Jobs.

Oh, this must be his house.

363
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,500
Today's building, the Sakata residence,

364
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,380
was recently renovated by two Amanto architect brothers, Unkei and Kaikei,

365
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,070
The exterior is reminiscent of the Greek Parthenon

366
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,180
and it is combined with a gorgeous palace section. I will now guide you through the Sakata residence.

Let's talk to the master of the house, Sakata-san.

Is this it? Just push the button...

371
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,120
I can feel a vibration...as profound as the exterior of the house.

372

Basically, even if you start a conversation, the DORK (Dumb Old Retarded Kook) will ignore you.

That's because he already has his hands full with his own life.

He'll get depressed sometimes.

You may want to give him encouragement, but you must not talk to him.
