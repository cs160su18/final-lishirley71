00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,570
[What Ito truly sought was the ties with
other people that he had severed...]

3
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,070
[The Shinsengumi Crisis Arc comes to its conclusion!]

4
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,980
I told you that your arms
and legs will rip off.

5
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,720
Who'd want to go and save
their sorry asses?

6
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,990
I can't stop. My body won't listen to me.

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,220
It's being pulled forward...Strings are pulling
me from the front and the back.

8
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,510
It annoys me to no end...

9
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,510
These strings are as strong
as steel, but still...

10
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,010
You can have an arm and a leg or two.

11
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,220
Even if these strings can cut flesh...

12
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,990
I'd like to see them try to sever
an obnoxious bond!

13
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,370
Get down!

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,620
Sensei!

15
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,120
Ito!

16
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,010
Ito!

17
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,790
["It's All About the Beat and Timing"]

18
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,170
Gin-san!

19
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,260
Bansai-sama... In front!

20
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,920
White Knight! What is it you fight for?

21
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,470
What is it you risk your life for?!

22
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,900
The destruction of the samurai's
world is already inevitable.

23
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,860
Even if Shinsuke does not soil his
hands, this country will rot away!

24
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,280
Your struggles alone will not stop it!

25
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,980
There's no longer anything worth
saving of this country!

26
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,600
It's the samurai's duty to graciously give

27
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,530
this rotting country which has been completely
ravaged by the Amanto it's final rites!

28
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,840
This country must slit its belly!

29
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,570
If you want to die, then go ahead
and kill yourself with the coals!

30
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,570
[Note: Coal briquettes are often used for
suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.]

31
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,300
Gintoki Sakata...you are a ghost.

32
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:24,110
You once tried to protect this country
along with Shinsuke and the others.

33
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:31,450
You are obsessed and unable to
let go. You are a living ghost.

34
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,650
There is no longer anything
for you to protect!

35
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,660
Ghosts should go back
where they belong.

36
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,670
I'll play you a requiem!

37
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,910
The strings...!

38
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,240
Hey, bud!

39
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,220
Take off those headphones, dammit!

40
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,890
When did he grab my strings?

41
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,270
What're your waiting for? Fire!

42
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,460
Clean out your ears and listen up!

43
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,180
I've never once fought for the
sake of this cheap country.

44
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,140
I couldn't care less...

45
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,120
if the country or samurai
fell. I have always...

46
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Then, and now...

47
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,850
What I protect...

48
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,400
has never changed!

49
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,900
Bansai-sama!

50
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,050
What're you doing?

51
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,000
Get your heads out of your asses!

52
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,310
Vice-Chief...

53
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,330
...your orders...

54
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,460
This is to all of you! I've taken their leader's head!

55
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,430
The enemy is nothing more
than a flock of lost sheep!

56
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,930
Finish them off all at once!

57
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,820
Tsk, retreat!

58
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,800
Don't let them get away! Kill them all!

59
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,590
Why...why did you do that?

60
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,700
You committed treason.
Why did you protect us?

61
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,500
You're...not Shinsengumi...

62
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,100
but you seem to be tied to them in
a way that words cannot describe.

63
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,030
You're neither friends,
nor are you enemies.

64
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,270
...we're obnoxious bonds.

65
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,120
Hmph, I suppose there
are ties like that...

66
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,060
I didn't know. Or rather, I
didn't try to understand.

67
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,910
Despite hoping to create ties with people,
I severed them on my side.

68
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:01,040
I lost sight of what I really wanted because
I tried to protect a tiny bit of pride.

69
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,070
Even when I finally found the ties
that were important to me,

70
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,870
I destroyed them on my side.

71
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,500
Why...

72
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,830
Why is it always too late when
you finally realize that?

73
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,690
Why is that I want to fight with everyone
but I can't even stand?

74
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,690
Why is that I want to wield my
sword, but I have no arm?

75
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:37,550
Why is it that...I finally truly realized
that...but I'm going to die...?

76
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:46,040
I don't want to die. If I die, I'll be
alone...no ties would reach me...

77
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,700
I don't want to be alone anymore...

78
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,750
We'd like you to...

79
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,550
hand him over to us.

80
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,310
...Please. He's gone through enough.

81
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,230
Odd Jobs... We owe you
for your help this time.

82
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,060
But we cannot heed your request.

83
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,930
How many people do you think
lost their lives because of him?

84
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,440
We must deal with the traitor ourselves.

85
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,500
He saved us! And he...

86
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,960
Kondo-san!

87
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,560
Take him.

88
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,770
Why?!

89
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,930
Kondo-san, why...?

90
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,200
Kondo-san...

91
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,790
That's right...he'd die anyway
even if they left him alone.

92
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,340
That's exactly why...

93
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,740
That's exactly why they must kill him.

94
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,770
Get up...Ito.

95
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,130
What do you say we settle this?

96
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:29,000
They...don't want him to die
a filthy traitor's death.

97
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,470
They want him to end his
life...as a samurai...

98
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,650
...and a fellow comrade.

99
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,970
That's the death he deserves.

100
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
Hijikata!

101
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,590
Ito!

102
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,870
...ank...you...

103
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,270
Thank...you...

104
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,110
I see. Ito died and the
Shinsengumi survived.

105
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,770
So the Bakufu is unexpectedly
alive and well.

106
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,670
No, perhaps Ito was weak...or...

107
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,100
Was it you who was weak, Bansai?

108
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,030
The original intent of this job

109
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,010
was to draw away the Shinsengumi's
attention from the Bakufu bigwigs.

110
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,790
If the Harusame successfully
made their secret voyage

111
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,120
and a secret agreement was reached with the Bakufu
bigwigs, there's no need for a battle.

112
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,450
We would have succeeded
in warding them off.

113
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,820
I thought I told you to handle this with
the intent of crushing the Shinsengumi.

114
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,550
As in all things, it's all about
the beat and the timing.

115
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,420
Without both, nothing will go well.

116
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,330
If I can't get into it, I back out
immediately. That's how I do things.

117
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,610
Bansai.

118
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,560
You can't get attuned my song?

119
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,620
The White Knight said, "What
I protect has never changed."

120
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,410
Shinsuke...any idea what
he was talking about?

121
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,700
It made me feel like asking
him until I find out.

122
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,780
I've fallen in love with
their song. I've lost.

123
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,700
...This is bad...

124
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,900
Really bad. They totally think I'm dead.

125
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,920
I never dreamed they would
hold a funeral so soon.

126
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm totally too late. I blew the timing.

127
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,010
...I've changed my mind.

128
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,600
I want to hear...a bit more of your song.

129
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,180
Live on, I look forward to the day when
you'll let me here the rest of it.

130
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,820
And so that's how it went.

131
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,490
No one expected that I would
miraculously still be alive.

132
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,160
This is bad.

133
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,320
Not only was I spared because
of the enemy's compassion,

134
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,740
but if they found out I spent all this time
in the hospital without contacting them...

135
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,080
And the timing couldn't be worse.

136
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,430
"Sorry, I'm alive, after all."

137
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,980
If I showed up like that, they'd
discipline me...for sure.

138
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm in big trouble. What'll I do?!

139
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,490
Maybe I should die. At this point, things
would be easier if I were dead.

140
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,680
You fool! Leaving this life before
an old man! You....you...you...!

141
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,350
Stop it! Don't make it any worse!

142
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,130
You're making it harder and
harder for me to show myself.

143
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,940
You know I...thought of
you...like a real son...

144
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,870
I didn't know...

145
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,870
...Pops...that you thought
so highly of me...

146
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,120
Pusuke! Don't leave me behind!

147
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,150
Why am I alongside a dog?!

148
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,070
Or rather...this funeral is
totally about the dog!

149
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,660
It's like, "we may as well include
Yamazaki while we're at it!"

150
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,800
Regardless of how unremarkable
I may have been, this is too cruel!

151
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,230
[Note: Parody of Milo, the Nestle chocolate drink.]

152
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,230
Why is there a can of Nilo
there as an offering?!

153
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,770
Hey Priest! Why're you
sipping on my Nilo?!

154
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,740
Not that I really cared for it
or anything, but cut it out!

155
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,760
You're making me angry.

156
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,770
Hey! Turn off that cell phone.

157
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,950
Huh? I'm at the funeral for
Boss Matsudaira's dog.

158
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,900
Tell them it's my funeral.

159
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,850
Oww...

160
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,330
My leg fell asleep.

161
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,390
Put away the JUMP, dammit.

162
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,060
Doesn't a human life mean
anything to you?

163
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,280
How could they! They're like an
undisciplined gang of hoodlums.

164
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,860
The Vice-Chief...isn't the
Vice-Chief back yet?

165
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,820
What's with this? Haven't they
lifted Vice-Chief's punishment?

166
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,240
Without his leadership, the Shinsengumi
wouldn't exist today.

167
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,710
Seems he feels personally
responsible this time.

168
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,540
I heard he personally asked for
the suspension to be extended.

169
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,610
Come to think of it, he acted
strangely back then too.

170
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,080
You think he won't come back
to the Shinsengumi?

171
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,350
After what happened,

172
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,900
we may not be able to return to the
Shinsengumi we were before.

173
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,610
Thank you for waiting.

174
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,860
I visited every temple
and shrine in the city

175
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,860
and had them do every incantation
and prayer they knew.

176
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,290
But in the end, this never left my side.

177
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,870
Seems this thing's curse...is deeply
ingrained in my very being.

178
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,610
No telling when this will
consume me again.

179
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,490
Does that mean you won't return
to the Shinsengumi?

180
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,000
You should think about changing jobs.

181
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,450
[Note: Animate is a chain that sells
everything related to animation.]

182
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,220

183
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,450

You are truly one with your sword.
It's the perfect sword for you.

186
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,480
You are the soul of the Shinsengumi.

187
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,670
We are the sword that protects you.

188
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,040
You say that so casually.

189
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,090
Thanks for you help.

190
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,780
Hijikata-san, where are you going?

191
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,830
Isn't it obvious?

192
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,900
My body has more angry spirits and curses
on it than it can accommodate.

193
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,630
It's full of all the people I've stepped
over and the enmity of my comrades.

194
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,790
What's another curse or two gonna do?

195
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,520
I don't intend to look back
no matter who dies.

196
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,720
I intend to shoulder every one
of them and move forward...

197
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,260
so they won't laugh at me in Hell.

198
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,460
...Nice weather.

199
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,240
Oh.

200
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,330
We forgot to collect our fee.

201
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,680
Forget it.

202
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,810
It's better to collect a little at a
time rather than all at once.

203
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,410
Do you think he'll be okay, though?

204
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,290
Will he be able to continue working?

205
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,500
He'll be fine.

206
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,850
We don't have to worry any more.
