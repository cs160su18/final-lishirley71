History is written by the victors.

3
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,520
But even if the radiant sunlight hides
the lights of the smaller stars,

4
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,180
even if those lights never
reach the people,

5
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,090
there exists a star, who risks
its life to shine brightly.

6
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,670
This is a story about one such star.

7
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,510
Quitting the business to
live in retirement, eh?

8
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,780
Not bad.

9
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,860
But I wouldn't be able to stand
such a backwards place.

11
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,630
What would a reporter
want with me now?

12
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,080
Well, I was hoping to talk a bit.

13
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,080
I shouldn't need to tell you that I'm
researching the Anti-Foreigner War.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,790
I would love to hear

15
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,710
your perspective as a military reporter

16
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:45,690
who was embedded with the Amanto, Bakufu,
and the Anti-Foreigner Faction during the war

17
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,050
and saw many different sights while
surviving many perilous situations.

18
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,910
I saw nothing...

19
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,910
No, you would know, Nagai-san!

20
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,000
As a journalist during the Anti-Foreigner War,
you must have encountered that enigmatic figure...

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Only rumors remain...

22
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,370
Now considered a myth...

23
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,120
You would know about that man...

24
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,090
You're not one to leave even
if I told you to, are you?

["It's better to take care of this year's business within the year, but once the year is about to end, you figure that you might as well put it off till next year for a fresh start. That's how the end of the year goes."]

26
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,650
It began twenty-some years ago.

27
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,440
The Amanto ships arrived in
Edo and began their attack,

28
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,890
using overwhelming military force
to compel the opening of Edo.

29
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,240
A number of unequal
treaties were signed.

30
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,650
The samurai lost their patience with
the Bakufu's soft foreign policy

31
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,830
and sensing the crisis at hand,

32
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,990
they gathered under
the Anti-Foreign ideal.

33
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,440
They fought,

34
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,760
but their actions only led to much death.

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,420
However, the war unexpectedly
reached a stalemate.

36
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,360
The Amanto had an overwhelming
technological advantage,

37
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,530
but the efforts of the Anti-Foreigner Faction
allowed them to at least put up a fight.

38
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:26,610
That was largely because they avoided direct
battles and adopted guerrilla warfare.

39
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,830
But the main reason was

40
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,180
because they were samurai.

41
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,740
Even if their weapons
were clearly inferior,

42
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,670
they fought without any fear.

43
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:48,370
The highly advanced Amanto were unable to
understand the desperation of the samurai.

44
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,770
Samurai...

45
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,430
The Amanto feared their existence.

46
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,940
But that served to prolong the
war as it became a quagmire.

47
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,860
That's right.

48
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,620
A very long period of war existed, during which the
Anti-Foreigner Faction were labeled traitors,

49
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,620
but there was still hope.

50
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,110
This was when a group of young people
began distinguishing themselves.

51
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,500
The unstoppable noble, Kotaro Katsura.

52
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,970
The leader of the Kiheitai,
Shinsuke Takasugi.

53
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,590
A master swordsman,
Tatsuma Sakamoto.

54
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,400
An impressive bunch.

55
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,710
The Faction regained their morale as they
saw these men risk their lives in battle.

56
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,600
Soon, a large number of young men
had assembled around them.

57
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,280
On the surface, correct?

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,890
How much do you know?

59
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,790
Technically, I know nothing.

60
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,580
But I have confirmed that he existed.

61
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,760
An enigma, who wielded
unparalleled influence

62
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,870
for a person who never appeared
in the pages of history.

63
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,350
Blazing across the battlefield in a flash

of white as he cut down sturdy
Amanto with one swing.

65
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,750
Admired by allies as a pillar of support

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,420
while instilling terror in his foes.

67
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,660
He was known as the "White Devil."

68
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,140
The White Devil...?

69
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,320
Yes.

70

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,360
I heard that he wasn't coming
today, so I brought one.

163
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,100
If you'd like, I could stamp yours.

164
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,150
You aren't going anywhere
for summer vacation?

165
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,110
Is your family also poor?

166
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,200
It's not so much money as...

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,270
I have health problems so I have to
visit the hospital on a regular basis.

168
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,680
I can't take any extended trips.

169
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,750
I see.

170
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,920
You have the money, but your body
won't do what you want it to.

171
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,270
Nothing works out in this world.

172
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,550
My body's perfectly fine,
but I have no money.

173
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,490
It's better that way.

174
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,500
With my health problems,
I can't do anything very long.

175
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,090
I don't even get to go to the
temple school as much.

176
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,170
That's why I wanted to see this
through to the end of summer.

177
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,030
It would be sad if I wasn't able to accomplish
anything after being born into this world.

178
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,090
Anything will do.

179
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,530
I just wanted to see
something to the end.

180
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,700
That's pretty ominous.

181
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,990
You sound like you're about to die.

182
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,880
S-Sorry...

183
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,350
I have a bad habit of being
pessimistic about everything.

184
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,320
But I'm glad that you're here.

185
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,060
I would have been lonely all by myself.

186
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,090
Kagura-chan, will you come
again tomorrow?

187
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,730
Of course.

188
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,950
Once I've made up my mind, I'll come
if it's raining cats or dogs or spears.

189
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,550
If you're a man, stop whining and
finish what you set out to do.

190
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,610
You'd better come, even if you
have to drag yourself here.

191
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,100
I can't be motivated if I don't
have any competition.

192
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,470
Y-Yeah.

193
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,810
Thanks, Kagura-chan.

194
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,590
Let's do our best together.

195
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,060
Yeah!

196
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,880
Kabukicho radio exercise #2.

197
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,250
Ready...

198
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,460
Relax your entire body while hopping.

199
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,590
1, 2, 3, 4.

200
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,330
Stick your right hand in the air
while hurling like a drunk.

201
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,150
5, 6, 7, 8.

202
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,550
Can't you tell that I have a hangover?

203
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,360
That's our Gin-chan!

204
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,290
He's like the real thing!

205

[Sakata]

206
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,500
Spread your arms and flex like a gorilla.

207
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,640
That's our boss lady!

208
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,070
Looks just like a gorilla!

209

[Shimura]

210
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,800
Wave your arms and legs while sprinting
like an Anti-Foreigner Faction man.

211
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,220
Wait!

212
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,160
That's our Zura!

213
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,750
Catch him already!

214
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,550
It's Katsura, not Zura!

215
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,830
[Katsura]

216
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,790
Get on all fours like a [beep]
waiting to be punished.

217
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,710
Smack me!

218
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,590
Smack me all you want!

[Sarutobi]

220
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,060
Lie flat on your back on the ground,
like a man without a job.

221
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,330
This isn't exercise!

222
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,410
I'm not doing anything here!

223
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,600
[Hasegawa]

224
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,730
Kagura-chan, I never knew how fun it was to
accomplish something with someone else.

225
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,550
What are you saying all of a sudden?

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,770
I always blamed my inability to do anything
on my illness, my poor health.

227
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,750
If only I had a normal body...

228
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,950
If only I was healthy...

229
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,820
I was being jealous of other people for it.

230
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,560
But that wasn't what I needed.

231
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,370
I'm glad I joined in these radio exercises.

232
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,440
I learned that the hard things can
be fun when you're with others...

233
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,750
It's all because I made a friend like you.

234
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,890
A-Are you stupid?

235
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,470
Why are you so happy?

236
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,900
Your card hasn't been
completely stamped yet!

237
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,010
A field trip isn't over until you've made
it home and greeted your parents!

238
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,420
Radio exercises aren't over until you've gotten
your last stamp and gone home to take a nap!

239
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,060
Don't relax until you've gotten through
the last spurt, goody two-shoes!

240
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,200
Right!

241
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,900
Canceled?!

242
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,440
What do you mean?

243
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,900
I didn't hear anything about that!

244
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,760
What is there to hear?

245
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,760
What kind of fool would
go exercise in this rain?

246
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,100
This fool right here!

247
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,410
A little rain won't be enough to stop me!

248
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,160
The radio exercise itself is canceled.

249
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,930
Kids don't do radio exercises
when it rains,

250
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,920
just as girls don't participate in swimming
class when it's that time of the month.

251
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,740
B-But after I got all these stamped...

252
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,990
I'll stamp it for you later.

253
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,390
Doesn't count if it's raining.

254
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,890
Like an unearned win.

255
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,250
That's not the issue here!

256
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,600
We want to see this through!

257
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,970
Doesn't change the fact
that it's been canceled.

258
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,780
This is a good opportunity for you to rest.

259
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,800
Isn't that kid unhealthy?

260
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,620
Don't push him too hard.

261
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,820
Kabukicho radio exercise #1.

262
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,460
Ready...

263
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,840
He collapsed?!

264
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,180
Why?!

265
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,470
He was fine just the other day...

266
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,470
He was exercising with me!

267
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,760
Our son doesn't have long to live...

268
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,570
That's what the doctor said.

269
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,890
Though we never told him.

270
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,220
He must have realized...

271
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,210
He suddenly said that he wanted
to accomplish something.

272
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,940
The doctor said to have him rest,

273
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,110
but he kept begging us
to let him go exercise.

274
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,000
But I never thought that he would
have gone out in that rain...

275
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,250
He said he'll go even if it's raining
cats or dogs or spears.

276
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,980
That was the promise he
made with his first friend.

277
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,670
I broke our promise...

278
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,680
I said I would come if it was raining
cats or dogs or spears.

279
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,010
I promised...

280
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,770
Sorry... If I hadn't said that...

281
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,290
It's okay.

282
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,160
I would have gone, even
if you hadn't promised.

283
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,300
It would be frustrating for rain to get in the
way of everything we've accomplished.

284
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,660
But I guess it was no good.

285
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,500
It was no fun exercising by myself.

286
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,690
It wasn't any fun without Kagura-chan.

287
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,740
Sorry, you helped me this far.

288
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,630
But it looks like I won't be able to
see this through to the end.

289
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,440
That's not true.

290
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,390
You can't give up yet.

291
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,770
I'll keep exercising and getting
stamps until you come back.

292
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,670
Did you know?

293
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,520
You can get a stamp on a rainy day
because it's like an unearned win.

294
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,280
So...

295
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,290
So come back.

296
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,320
We can exercise together again.

297
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:07,000
It won't stop raining until you come back.

298
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,040
I'll be waiting...

299
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,000
The whole time...

300
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,300
Kabukicho radio exercise #1!

301
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,110
Ready!

302
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,230
Hey, I said ready.

303
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,080
Stand.

304
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,300
Or I won't stamp you.

305
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,430
Gin-chan...

306
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,050
First, lift your arms up
and stretch your back!

307
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,810
Yes!

308
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,540
1, 2, 3, 4!

309
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,430
5, 6, 7, 8!

310
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,100
1, 2, 3, 4!

311

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,940
5, 6, 7, 8!

316
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,620
1, 2, 3...

317
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,320
Okay! Now line up!

318
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,860
No cutting!

319
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,960
Hey, kid. What do you
think you're doing?

320
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Want me to brand you
instead of a stamp?

321
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,990
