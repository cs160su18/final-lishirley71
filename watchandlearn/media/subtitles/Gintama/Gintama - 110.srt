[The man in the cell opposite Katsura who has recently been imprisoned is Suekichi, who has been trying to escape from prison for 15 years.]

3
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,080
[What is going to happen to this man?! This
week is "Katsura Enrichment Week" part II!]

4
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,880
There's Prison Island.

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,150
Throughout the ages, it's been the one prison
where the worst offenders are sent.

6
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,590
It's a steel fortress that encompasses
the entire island.

7
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,150
Once you enter, you will never
see sunlight again.

8
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,530
It's a real netherworld in
the land of the living.

9
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,640
Starting today, that's your home.

10
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,910
So you'd better bid a fond
farewell to the sun.

11
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,770
Don't worry.

12
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,610
I've already finished saying farewell to everyone
from Yaoyorozu to Amaterasu.

13
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,610
[Note: Yaoyorozu are spirits that dwell within objects and part of the Shinto religion. Amaterasu is a Japanese mythological sun goddess.]

14
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,440
All men are prepared for death every
morning they sit down for breakfast.

15
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,470
For me, each day brings absolutely
nothing special.

16
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,210
It's said the world is very large,

17
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,390
but my world has been this
small cell for a long time.

18
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,150
The view behind steel bars
has been my whole world.

19
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,390
I spend every day in this moldy-smelling
cell where my heart has been corrupted.

20
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,310
I don't remember how many times
my heart almost broke.

21
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,740
But finally the time has come for
me to leave those days behind.

22
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,370
That's right.

23
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,860
There's a boundless beautiful world out there
that's not meant to be seen through bars.

24
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,040
To gaze upon that world
is all I've ever wanted.

25
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,610
["People Are All Escapees of
Their Own Inner Prisons"]

26
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,570
Finally... Finally I've made it.

27
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,860
It's taken 15 years to dig
out of here. 15 years...

28
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,300
I've pounded into my mind
the guards' routines

29
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,350
and the times when other
prisoners are asleep.

30
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,290
I took advantage of a little overlap
time to dig through rock and stone,

31
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,870
little by little, every day. And I kept
at it for 15 years... And finally...

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,780
It's the day I escape from Prison
Island, the invulnerable fortress.

33
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,680
Suekichi, you've really outdone yourself.

34
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,170
...It was all your tenacity...

35
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,890
All I need to do is find the right time
to carry it out... I can't be impatient.

36
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,690
The best time is early morning
when the prisoners are asleep.

37
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,360
The best day is when the sea is calm.

38
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,500
I've already secured an
exit route for escape.

39
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,600
So I need to carefully pick the
perfect day and carry it out.

40
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,580
Fortunately, the prison
cell opposite mine,

41
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,800
which I have to watch the
most, is now vacant.

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,650
If I can escape before a
new prisoner arrives...

43
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,140
...there won't be any problems.

44
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,010
Oh, you're awake. Good morning.
Isn't it a nice day?

45
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,590
I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself.

46
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,890
You looked like you were asleep.

47
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,280
I just came in today. Prisoner
number "Ha-206," Katsura.

48
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,880
It's nice meeting you, cell mate.

49
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,790
Why?!

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,580
Until yesterday, it was completely vacant.

51
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,200
But why today, of all days, did they
have to bring in a newcomer?!

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,290
Here's something for you.

53
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,120
It's an Anti-Foreigner Faction towel.

54
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,650
It's very good at wiping away filthy stains.
Especially those from our world.

55
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,390
[Note: Wordplay on Joi (which also means Anti-Foreigner
Faction) and Joy dishwashing liquid.]

56
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,750
Because it's Joi.

57
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,390
Th-This is bad...

58
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,060
My cell is completely visible
to the opposite prison cell.

59
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,880
I've been able to accomplish
my work thus far because

60
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,410
there was no prisoner
on the opposite side.

61
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,640
But now... It can't be...!

62
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,200
And this guy looks so irritating!

63
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,390
Um... This is an Anti-Foreigner
Faction towel.

64
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,240
It's very good at wiping away filthy stains.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,460
Especially those from our world.

66
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,060
Because it's Joi.

67
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,350
He thought I didn't hear him so he
repeated the same corny joke!

68
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,810
I heard it! It's not funny no matter
how many times you say it!

69
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,380
Calm down.

70
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,600
All I need is a chance to crawl through
the tunnel and escape from this island.

71
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,770
Even if this guy is in the cell opposite mine,
there'll be an opening within 24 hours.

72
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,700
At this point, I can't be picky
about the date and time.

73
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,240
As soon as I get the chance...

74
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,960
Luckily, the labor in this place is like the agony
of hell so it wears out all the prisoners.

75
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,030
Most likely, he'll be exhausted and fall asleep
right after he gets back from his first night.

76
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,070
I'll take that chance tonight when he's
so tired he'll fall right to sleep.

77
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,420
Just as I thought...

78
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,370
I can't see well in the dark,
but his snoring...

79
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,770
...means it's unlikely he'll wake
up from any sounds.

80
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,600
I've been spotted?! It can't be!

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,490
But I can feel his gaze on
me. It's boring into me!

82
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,040
No way!

83
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,730
Don't tell me!

84
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,050
What kind of sleeping face is that?!

85
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,840
This is bad! I've heard about people
who sleep with their eyes half open.

86
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,030
But his eyes are wide open!

87
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,370
His eyeballs must've dried up! He's
definitely looking right at me!

88
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,790
His dried-up eyeballs are
looking right at me!

89
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,080
What a strange sleeping face!

90
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,890
That was a shock. It should
be all right, right?

91
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,100
He's not really awake, is he?
He's snoring, anyway...

92
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,020
Huh? But what if he's not asleep?

93
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,840
This should be all right, right? No,
he's awake, isn't he? He is, right?

94
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,480
Something like this is not good.

95
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,240
I should check.

96
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,410
Ka-Katsura-san.

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,890
No need to worry. He's sleeping,
just as I thought.

98
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,580
All right!

99
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,550
I can go now...

100
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,960
So he is awake!

101
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,480
Why is he sleeping in a runner's
crouch?

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,940
He's not sleeping, is he?! He's
in a runner's crouch!

103
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,890
He looks like he's about
to run somewhere!

104
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,810
What should I do? Things are
getting more complicated now.

105
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,230
He's snoring, but... no...wait...no...but...

106
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,210
What's the matter, Suekichi-dono.
You didn't sleep well last night?

107
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,040
That's not good. You won't be able
to handle the hard work here.

108
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,220
Whose fault do you think it was?!

109
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,460
I was completely tricked by him.

110
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,500
I thought there was no way in the world
a guy could be this bad a sleeper.

111
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,860
If I keep up this lifestyle,
I'll lose all my strength.

112
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,230
I have to solve this as soon as possible.

113
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,520
I should preempt him.

114
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,640
Lights out!

115
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,530
I don't need to make him fall asleep.

116
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,440
I just need to create a chance
for me to escape.

117
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,110
Well, I've had problems
falling asleep lately.

118
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,520
Do you have any tricks that
would help me fall asleep?

119
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,870
Let's play UNO. I'm pretty good.

120
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,760
No, I'd better get some
sleep for tomorrow.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,240
I see, but I'm really good at it.

122
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,250
No, thanks, but do you know
anything a bit more basic?

123
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,330
I know! Why don't we count
sheep, Katsura-san?

124
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,300
They say counting sheep with your
eyes closed helps you fall asleep.

125
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,530
Is that so? I think UNO would
be better. I'm pretty good.

126
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,990
Yeah, but it'll just keep me awake.

127
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,210
Then let's close our eyes and
start counting sheep together.

128
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,120
How about that? Here
we go... One sheep.

129
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,510
Two sheep... Three sheep...

130
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,360
Yes!

131
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,970
He won't open his eyes
until tomorrow morning.

132
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,880
And if it works out, he'll fall asleep.

133
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,050
But I shouldn't start moving yet.

134
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,660
I'll see how it goes after
he's counted 20 sheep.

135
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,580
11 sheep...12 sheep...

136
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,080
13 sh...?

137
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,880
What is Matsuko doing?

138
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,200
Hurry up and jump! You're
holding up the line.

139
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,930
What happened, Matsubara?
Did you twist your ankle?

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,910
A ladybug...was here.

141
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,640
Geez... You're really...

142
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,490
Matsuko Matsubara. She was
always smiling like that.

143
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,300
She could jump higher than anyone and
she was always smiling like that.

144
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,840
That's all.

145
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,320
These five people will make up the
starting lineup for the tournament.

146
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,000
This will be the last tournament
for you guys as third-graders.

147
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,000
[Note: In Japan, a third-grader is a senior
in middle school/high school.]

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,380
Do your best!

149
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,530
All right!

150
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,770
I heard Matsubara Senpai was benched
even though it's her last tournament.

151
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,800
She hasn't even been showing
up to practice lately.

152
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,080
She's not even here today.

153
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,290
There's a rumor that she has a boyfriend.

154
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,700
He's Fujimura Senpai, a third-grader.

155
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,900
I think he just hangs around her.

156
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,840
But it works well for Sugiyama Senpai.

157
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,910
There's no way she could
beat Matsubara Senpai.

158
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,600
Hey, you're talking too loud!

159
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,440
Sensei.

160
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Do you have a minute to talk?

161
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,860
[GYM STORAGE]

162
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,860
What's this all about?

163
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,070
Why isn't Matsuko in the starting lineup?

164
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,460
She's our ace, isn't she?

165
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,990
I'm not happy about wearing the uniform of a starting
player just because Matsuko didn't show up.

166
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,330
I'm returning this to you.

167
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,560
...She quit the club.

168
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,900
You're the only one who can take
Matsuko's position in this club.

169
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,220
I'm sure you know that, because
you and her have been

170
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,130
competing against each other
as rivals for three years.

171
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,080
...I wanted to get to this
position by beating her.

172
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,470
Because she's my best friend, I wanted
to win the position by beating her.

173
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,770
...Sugiyama.

174
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,430
I'm sorry...

175
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,940
How could you?

176
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,140
I won't lose to you!

177
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,950
I'll definitely score more points than
you and outperform you...

178
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,460
...and I'll win the tournament!

179
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,960
Sugiyama...

180
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,270
She...

181
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,590
She...

182
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,410
...found out about your health.

183
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,480
More than anyone or anything...

184
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,940
...she wanted to jump higher.

185
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,620
Hey, isn't Sugiyama here yet?

186
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,340
It's thirty minutes to tip-off.
What is she doing?!

187
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,320
Sensei! Sugiyama Senpai's
mother just called!

188
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,840
When Senpai was on her way...

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,050
...she fell and was taken to the hospital.

190
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,620
...Idiot.

191
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,840
You weren't supposed to come, right?

192
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,710
...No, I needed to come...

193
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,940
...to pick up...my team uniform.

194
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,900
Here you go.

195
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,860
I'm so proud that you're my rival.

196
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,740
Matsuko...

197
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,270
I regret that I chose the
same position as you.

198
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,770
Actually...it doesn't really
matter if we're rivals.

199
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,950
I just... I just wanted to...

200
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,090
...play on the same court with you.

201
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,700
That summer...

202
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,520
...after knowing real kindness...

203
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,280
She jumped higher...

204
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,100
...than anyone or anybody ever...

205
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,160
Sh...Sh...

206
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,830
13 sheep!

207
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,810
That was too long!

208
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,460
What's wrong, Suekichi-dono?

209
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,360
You didn't get any sleep
last night, either?

210
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,590
That's not good. You've been
looking like that for a while.

211
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,320
...Damn it.

212
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,210
All I need to do is just go through
the tunnel and escape this island.

213
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,610
Then I'll finally taste freedom.

214
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,110
Why is it so difficult to do
something so simple?

215
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,330
He's the biggest curse of all.

216
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,500
At first, he didn't seem to have any
flaws, but he's actually full of them.

217
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,830
Once he was provoked,
he revealed his fangs.

218
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,920
But he still has flaws, in fact, It's
like he's the Hell of Infinity.

219
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,690
As long as this guy is in the cell opposite
me, it's impossible for me to escape.

220
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,630
I should give up any hopes
of exploiting his flaws.

221
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,610
I should kill him. I won't be able to
get my freedom unless I kill him.

222
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,570
But how...?

223
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,840
Hey, are you the newcomer?

224
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,420
Now we have a pretty boy.

225
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,780
Hey, young master, what did
you do to get thrown in here?

226
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,320
That's...Shachi!

227
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,570
Robbery, murder, kidnapping...

228
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,940
He's the king of crime, the boss of all criminals who's
committed multiple crimes...the killer, Shachi!

229
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,570
Hey, what's with that look?

230
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,800
What are looking at, huh? Huh?
Are you picking a fight with me?

231
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,820
Hey, stop it! Don't get in
any trouble with him!

232
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,750
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I offend you?

233
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,020
I'm sorry. I had something
I was concerned about.

234
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,600
That's right! Be quiet and
don't go aggravating him.

235
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,940
Well...

236
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,330
...your kimono is torn.

237
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,830
Fashion!

238
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,070
That's just the fashion!

239
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,980
It's a fashion statement that
makes him look wild!

240
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,920
And there're scribbles on your face, too.

241
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,340
It looks like someone played a joke
on you while you were asleep.

242
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,950
Are you making fun of him?! It's
supposed to be like this, dude!

243
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:32,930
Huh? You did this on purpose? You
purposely cut it so raggedly?

244
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,300
Stop it! Don't mention it!
Don't talk about that!

245
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,530
...Not really...

246
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,720
Somehow...the sleeves bothered me, so I
just cut them off, and it came out like this.

247
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,190
Shachi! Now he's getting
all shy! He's losing face!

248
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,700
Hey, what are you doing?!
Be quiet and eat!

249
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,310
Tsk. You guys, we'll remember this.

250
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,680
You guys?! What's with "guys"?! They'll
all keep an eye on me, too?!

251
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,490
This is the worst. In order to keep my escape
plan a secret, I've kept quiet until now!

252
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,350
This was going to be over soon! But if
people like them keep an eye on me...

253
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,570
But wait! I should turn this predicament
into an advantage!

254
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,940
I'll plot to offer Katsura to Shachi.

255
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,530
That way, Shachi will owe me
and Katsura will be dead!

256
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,010
Two birds with one stone!

257
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,010
First of all, I need to get close
to Shachi's gang members.

258
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,630
Oh! They look pretty hostile towards me.

259
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,720
...Oh, well. I have to show them
that I'm their comrade.

260
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,110
What?! You want to meet Shachi?

261
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,330
Yeah. I want him to know that I have
no hostilities toward any of you.

262
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,260
That crazy man isn't my friend at all.

263
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,090
That reminds me, you didn't
bother us that time.

264
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,490
Shachi-san, Suekichi wants to see you.

265
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,090
Well, this is perfect.

266
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,280
Just as I thought, this ragged
sleeve style is really effective!

267
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,000
What is it? What do you want?

268
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,000
Leave me alone. Just leave
me alone, already.

269
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,510
Shachi?! He's cutting off the
ragged part of his sleeves!

270
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,590
He's been like that ever since.

271
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,760
He's cutting off all the ragged
parts from his kimono.

272
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,610
Stop it, Shachi! It's so cool!

273
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,010
Stop worrying about it! Those
ragged parts are really cool!

274
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,270
I really don't care if it's cool or uncool!

275
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,220
That's not the reason I wore it like that.

276
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll never wear ragged sleeves again!

277
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,130
You're so annoying! Shachi, you really
are! How sensitive are you?

278
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,800
Let me tell you something...my ragged
bangs and my sleeves are not related.

279
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,260
Don't get me wrong! Ah, I'm going
to cut this, too! I'll do it!

280
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,370
Stop, Shachi! Not the ragged hair!

281
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,530
Hey, what are you wearing?!

282
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,550
Damn it! In this situation, my outfit makes
it look like I'm making fun of him!

283
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,450
I found another one here!
Another ragged one!

284
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,360
Are you hurt, Suekichi-dono?

285
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,610
Huh? Um...

286
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,540
You bastards! You made Suekichi-dono's
sleeves ragged. Shame on you!

287
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,670
No, his sleeves were already like that!

288
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,770
We didn't do that!

289
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,390
Shut up! What are all these
triangular pieces?!

290
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,570
They're enough evidence!

291
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,040
No! That's from Shachi's...!

292
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,390
Shut up!

293
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,820
What's wrong, Suekichi-dono?

294
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,770
You couldn't sleep last night again?

295
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,860
Katsura-san!

296
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,950
It's because we were playing UNO all night
until early this morning in your cell.

297
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,800
So he couldn't sleep with all the noise.

298
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,390
We're sorry, Suekichi-san. We
were so excited playing UNO.

299
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,350
Because Katsura-san is so
good at playing UNO.

300
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,520
No, Shachi, you're too weak.

301
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,340
That's right, Shachi.
You're way too weak!

302
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,250
Why?! Why did it turn out like this?!

303
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,400
Instead of being led to his death, Katsura
has extending his influence!

304
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,410
All right, everyone, it's about
time we went to work.

305
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,420
Yes!

306
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,510
He's acting like the head prisoner!

307
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,860
Take care, Katsura-dono.

308
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,560
Yeah.

309
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,620
How did he manage to
influence the guard?!

310
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,420
Who is he, anyway?!

311
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,840
In just a few days, he's gained
control of this hellish prison.

312
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,630
It could be that I've challenged
an extraordinary man.

313
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,870
Even if I realize the huge size
of the wall in front of me,

314
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,850
somehow I don't despair.

315
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,990
This Prison Island was called Hell,

316
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,210
but it has been gradually
changed by that man.

317
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,640
Backbreaking work has changed
into something worthwhile,

318
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,200
even if it's still really hard.

319
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,210
And criminals' eyes aren't so empty and
lifeless. They've started repenting for their crimes,

320
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,980
making up for their past sins
and correcting their ways

321
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:32,020
Their eyes have started looking
towards the future.

322
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,530
Through interaction with the prisoners...

323
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,700
...the guards have started
realizing the joy of forgiveness

324
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,690
and the value of rehabilitating people
instead of just abandoning them.

325
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,940
And for 15 years...

326
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,960
The man who avoided facing up to his crimes, who
only thought about escaping his hardships...

327
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,040
...and digging a tunnel...

328
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,530
...finally closed it off.

329
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,510
Man, I worked pretty hard today, too.
I've been sleeping well lately!

330
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,790
By the way, even that disgusting
prison food...

331
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,810
...is starting to taste good.

332
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,380
Human beings are creatures
that eat, work and sleep.

333
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,030
If any one of these is satisfied, the other two
will eventually become satisfied as well.

334
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,510
And only when these three have been satisfied
do people truly realize that they're alive.

335
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,850
Katsura-san, I've been looking forward
to the next day so much lately.

336
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,780
We're treated like earthworms,

337
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,070
but I feel like we are remembering what
it means to be human, day-by-day.

338
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,910
For the first time, I feel like I'm alive.

339
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,730
The one who taught us this was...

340
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,980
...you, Katsura-san.

341
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,490
Thank you...for helping us
become...humans again.

342
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,600
Hey, why are you crying at lights-off
time? The guard is coming.

343
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,730
Sorry...

344
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,980
Well, let's get some sleep for tomorrow.

345
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,850
Eating, working and sleeping.
That's what humans do.

346
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,380
Good night, Katsura-san.

347
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,490
Good night!

348
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,030
What's the matter, Suekichi-dono?
You still can't sleep?

349
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,420
You said you were a revolutionist,
but what brought you here?

350
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,760
I'm just curious about what kind
of crime you committed.

351
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:32,430
I didn't commit any crimes. I came
here of my own free will.

352
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,940
What for?

353
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,650
I'm a revolutionist of course.

354
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,710
So, I came to revolutionize Hell.

355
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,290
That's amazing! You make
such a bold statement!

356
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,280
Suekichi-dono, did I change
anything here?

357
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,760
...Well...I don't know, but...

358
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,770
...at least I've changed.

359
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,800
My sleeping problem is gone.

360
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,600
I've decided to dig a new tunnel.

361
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,840
It's a long tunnel and I don't
know when it'll open.

362
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,420
That's right. It'll lead to tomorrow.

363
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,980
I don't need any escape routes anymore.

364
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,490
I'll fight for the sake of tomorrow.

365
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,390
With that guy... With that man...
I'll be able to reach it.

366
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,410
He's finally asleep. He
gave me a hard time.

367
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,800
Thanks for waiting.

368
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,710
He was a tough guy who
didn't have any flaws.

369
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,600
Although I already had an escape route,

370
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,320
[THIS WAY!]

371
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,180
I never imagined I'd have a man with sleeping
problems in the cell opposite mine.

372
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,260
But I can easily handle it.

373
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,200
It looked like he was completely tricked by
me and seems to have let his guard down.

374
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
It's too bad I won't be able to see his

375
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,310
shocked face when he finds
out that I disappeared,

376
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,530
but it can't be helped.

377
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,810
Goodbye! You guys will stay
chained here forever!

378
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,760
I've been spotted?! No way! No, he's looking
at me! Someone is watching me!

379
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,220
All right! Looks like he's finally asleep!
He gave me a hard time.

380
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,890
He was a tough guy who didn't
have any weaknesses.

381
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,240
Although I already had an escape route,

382
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,990
I had some trouble getting
him to let his guard down.

383
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,360
I've been spotted?! No way!

384
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,180
No, he's looking at me!
Someone is watching me!

385
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,070
All right!

386
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,190
It looks like he's finally asleep!
He gave me a hard time...

387
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,700
All right! He looks like he's finally asleep!

388
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,770
All right!

389
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,160
Senpai, there're so many
holes on the island.

390
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,580
Huh?

391
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,240
Just fill them in. Fill them in.

392
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,680
The next episode... "There's Almost a 100% Chance
You'll Forget Your Umbrella and Hate Yourself For It."

393
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,980
[And another episode will be "Definitely Do Not Let Your Girlfriend See The Things You Use For Cross-dressing." For the first time in many years, those ladies will appear.]

394
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:40,060
[Huh? You want to know what happened to Katsura afterwards? Never mind. Never mind. Take a break. Take a break.]
