Yeah.

I tried to stop her... But Gin-san said it's probably best for her to be with her father.

That's right, it's much better than staying with Good-For-Nothing Gin.

Hmph. She had a loud mouth, but I kinda miss her now that she's gone.

Everybody looks really sad. You're all sad because I'm not around, huh?!

Gee, I can't believe it really happened to me.

19

I'm not like you. How old do you think I am?

24

Is it some sort of disease? Did you get infected by someone?

No, it was a good modest size.

Hey, that's enough!

31
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,800
Did you pee on a worm? I heard it swells up if you do.

Oh, no. It wasn't a worm. It was more like a worm-like alien...

35
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,020
You pissed on an alien? Oh, no! That's bad.

36

My friend did that and now he's dead.

37
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:09,500
What?! He died? What does that mean? What'll happen to me? I mean...

I said that's enough!

39

He's only talking about his crotch. What?!

40

Well, it's Chinese Girl Booster Month at work, so everyone wears a Chinese dress to work.

This is not good. I don't want to die young.

It's like you're role-playing!

97
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,790
I guess so. But if you have a stone, it's a completely different story.

98
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,560
A stone is nasty. It really hurts.

99

Well yeah. It was all the way up in there.

But, I'm not dead.

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,100
And the future is, the four-eyed Kunoichi...

157
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,450
[Note: kunoichi = a female ninja. 91 is a parody of ku (9) ichi (1)]

158
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,410
Huh? Kunoichi four-eyes...? Right, let's go with that.

159
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,450
It's time for 91 Mega!

160
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,610
Oops! That was a mistake.

161
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,660
She's totally messed up.

162
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:25,580
Thus, um... Gin-san, please take me as your bride...

163
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,630
No, I mean...

164
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,100
As a member of the Odd Jobs...

165
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,150
We've already got four-eyes Shinpachi so, fuggedit.

166
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,720
This is a team and we all need our own distinct personality.

167
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,380
And the best way to show your personality is through your looks.

168
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,250
You don't want fans to say, "Hey, she's just copying Shinpachi's glasses!"

169
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:48,750
[Cannon, Tank, Char Exclusive is from Gundam. It's used to describe Red, High-speed, and distinguish it from others.]

170
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,580
For example... You should have a Mohawk or a huge weapon,

171
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,750
like a "cannon", "tank" or "Char Exclusive".

172
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,930
Make it so anybody can tell who you are just from your silhouette.

173
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,250
Get something like that, then come back.

174
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,000
He says that like he's the editor of a manga.

175
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,420
You can't complain anymore, right? Are you happy now?

176
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,980
Bully me all you want, but I'm a masochist. So I'm enjoying it too!

177
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,420
I'm an "M" (as in masochist) and you're "S" (as in sadist). We don't need anything else.

178
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,550
Sorry, but I'm kind of an "M" too.

179
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,200
Sa-chan, that's a Ma-da-O.

180
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,130
Hey, listen chickie! You pop up out of nowhere and call yourself the heroine!

181
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,390
This world ain't that easy!

182
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,930
Catherine, you...

183
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:35,420
I don't know who you are, but I've been working here for a long time, and you just showed up!

184
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,730
I'm the heroine in this anime!

185
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,830
Absolutely not!

186
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,340
Shut up, you middle-aged woman! You're just a waste of cat ears!

187
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,230
If I had your ears, I'd be a ninja with glasses and cat ears.

188
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,520
The triple crown of cute anime girl gimmicks!

189
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,060
My whole gimmick is being middle-aged and having cute cat ears. It's all good!

190
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,190
[Note: Usually, a cat-eared (nekomimi) character is a young girl.]

191
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,190
That's not very good at all.

192
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,210
That's enough! Knock it off you two!

193
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,930
How do you think Kagura would feel if she could see you right now?!

194
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,970
By the way,

195
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,130
I've known Gin-san a lot longer than any of you, uh-huh.

196
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,770
"Uh-huh"? Oh? Big sis? Are you trying to become the heroine now, Big sis?

197
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,980
How dare you look down on me, meow!

198
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,480
You don't even have any character, meow!

199
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,750
What's with the "meow"? Is that her new gimmick?

200
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,280
Is that your idea of a cute new speech pattern?

201
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,120
It doesn't matter if you've got strong character.

202
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,010
Your face is too strong, as in ugly, nin-nin.

203
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,610
What?!

204
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,660
You, too.

205
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,410
Don't get carried away, just because you've known Gin-san for a long time, glasses beam!

206
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,230
Don't mix up your lines so much!

207
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,270
But I've been here the longest, uh-huh!

208
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,800
You're using "uh-huh" wrong, Big sis.

209
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,040
What?! The length of time doesn't matter! Quality is more important!

210
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,430
I've already had experience doing a little of this and that with Gin-san!

211
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,050
What? You just said that it doesn't matter how strong a character is, right?

212
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,980
And you said "a little of this and that," but it's all in your imagination, right?!

213
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,310
Strong is better than weak, meow!

214
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,490
But it doesn't apply to the face!

215
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,490
This is getting downright nasty...

216
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,230
What about you guys?!

217
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,740
You don't like Gin-san as much as I do. I'm the one who deserves him, nin-nin.

218
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,700
I do like him... Next to cotton work gloves, he's the best, uh-huh.

219
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
How far down the list is that, meow?!

220
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,700
But most of all I love myself. So I hate losing to anyone, uh-huh.

221
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,910
Um...

222
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,830
Let me tell you something. I don't care about that useless man!

223
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,630
I just want to see you both lose, meow!

224
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,650
You lost the day you were born, nin-nin!

225
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,180
Hey, calm down.

226
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,660
If you keep this up, you'll never settle down.

227
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,550
You should listen to the opinions of us men.

228
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,690
What does "settle down" mean, anyway?

229
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:38,650
Men like us believe a woman has to meet three requirements to become a heroine.

230
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,910
Those are...

231
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,200
[FACE]

232
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,190
A pretty face,

233
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,500
style,

234
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,500
[STYLE]

235
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,530
personality.

236
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,800
[PERSONALITY]

237
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,280
I don't have any of those.

238
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,520
So for starters, we'll see you later!

239
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,950
Screw you.

240
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,410
You two can stay.

241
00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:02,150
Listen. A heroine needs a good face. But it doesn't just mean a pretty face.

242
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,020
A face that beats the crap out of people, but with a smile...

243
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,260
Or, someone who would create a parent-son problem on a kids' anime. Both of those are out of the question.

244
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
What I'm trying to say is...

245
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
It's all about your facial expression!

246
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,000
In different situations, you need to have the response your audience is expecting.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,900
Such as laughing when appropriate...

248
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:39,520
[This is just Shinpachi's imagination. This picture is slightly different from the real person.]

249
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,170
Getting angry when necessary...

250
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,490
I'm angry now, pun pun.

251
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,680
Having a background filled with flowers at any time...

252
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,470
It's one day late, but Happy Birthday!

253
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,510
Being able to tear up on cue.

254
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,000
Well...

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,050
Being able to cry when necessary.

256
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,520
I'm happy...but it's strange...

257
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,460
Therefore, the heroine will be...

258
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,060
Therefore, first of all, you...

259
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,340
Cry.

260
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,790
Then...

261
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,050
Please use this.

262
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,670
You got it wrong again!

263
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,750
It's out of the question.

264
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,200
You try it.

265
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,850
Well, that's easy.

266
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,420
Come on, cry! I won't stop until you're bawling!

267
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,990
Um... Why?

268
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,320
But this feels good...

269
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,940
[Note: Ora = a fighting taunt used when repeatedly punching someone]

270
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,790
Ora ora ora ora!

271
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,940
Hey, hey! Who told you to make someone cry? I said for YOU to cry.

272
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,600
But I think I can...

273
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,470
That's the reason he's a DORK.

274
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,120
Really, every single one of them...

275
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,870
Hey, I didn't do anything yet.

276
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,330
So how do I look, meow?

277
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,520
Missed every single one of them...

278
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,750
I'll kill you, bastard, meow!

279
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,990
Why don't you just give up?

280
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,420
I think we're done with the "face."

281
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,630
A heroine's style is very important.

282
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,160
[Note: Hasegawa takes the same pose as Gendo from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Both characters were voiced by the same voice actor.]

283
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,160
A heroine's gotta be, you know... Bang! Pow! Boom!

284
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,070
It's like fully grown fruit. Plump, but not fat.

285
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:14,220
[Due to circumstances, detailed examples are limited, so we are using images as metaphors. Thank you for your understanding.]

286
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,560
From the moment you see it, it doesn't matter if you remember her face!

287
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,610
Even dirty old geezers move their eyes up and down and side to side.

288
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,550
A heroine has to catch their attention! That's the heroine's big boobs...

289
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,220
I mean figure! I mean style!

290
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,490
An hourglass figure is the best. Yeah, yeah.

291
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,490
That's an old man's opinion.

292
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,000
So that excludes the monster cat ...

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,130
What?!

294
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,000
Now lets compare the two of you...

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,970
Bang.

296
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,730
Pow.

297
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,120
Boooooom!

298
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,510
You both pass.

299
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,380
The last thing is... Um... Huh? Was it "personality"?

300
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,470
Well... Both of you are perfect, so... I just can't pick a winner...

301
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,290
You had better pick one, uh-huh!

302
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,320
You chumps started this, mega bazooka.

303
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,660
Shi-Shinpachi-kun...

304
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,580
Wake up, Shinpachi-kun. You're the one who suggested "personality," so you should judge.

305
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,910
A heroine?

306
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,140
The heroine is...

307
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,640
Otsu-chan. I'd say it's Otsu-chan.

308
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,000
Ora!

309
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,280
Hmph. Come with me to the riverbank. We'll settle this, uh-huh!

310
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,930
Hmph.

311
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,640
Fine with me, nin-nin.

312
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,530
Gi-Gin-san...

313
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,750
What?

314
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,270
Really... How come we don't have any just plain nice girls around us?

315
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,030
You said it.

316
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,660
When it comes right down to it, Kagura-chan was the best of all, huh?

317
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,290
So true...

318
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,570
Hey, you guys are so pathetic.

319
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,620
You sent her packing, and you already miss her?

320
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,600
Hmph. This is how selfish men are and why I don't like them.

321
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,890
Right? Why don't you say something?

322
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,150
Sorry, I don't have an hourglass figure.

323
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,880
All right, don't say anything. Don't say a word.

324
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,110
I'm the only one who can handle you jerks. So I'm the heroine.

325
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,010
Don't you mean the mascot?

What?! You're not going to eat? Don't worry about money. It's on me today.

329
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,890
Don't you guys dare eat one bite! His face tells me he's plotting something.

330
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,820
And it says he's going to do something reckless.

331
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,140
No need for groundless suspicions.

332
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,310
Even if we're hungry, you can't buy us off with food. We're not that cheap.

333
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,980
You're way too sweet, Katsura-san.

334
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,890
Way too sweet! Like this chocolate that's melting.

335
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,150
Excuse me! Can I have a refill?

336
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,890
I should've been more careful. Elizabeth was always with me.

337
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,420
So I should've known she would attract the attention of the authorities.

338
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,550
So, who did it?

339
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,910
Chintaro Toyama, the evil magistrate.

340
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,410
He's a villain who takes bribes to satisfy his desires.

341
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,900
Elizabeth's head will definitely roll if I don't do something.

342
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,760
I beg you, Gintoki. Help me rescue Elizabeth.

What?! You're going to sneak into the magistrate's office, gozaru?

345
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,450
Well, this idiot just won't take no for an answer.

346
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,070
And I thought you're a ninja, so you're good at that kind of stuff. So, please.

347
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,690
Please what, gozaru?

348
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,590
Can you help turn us into ninja?

349
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,590
Are you underestimating the ninja, gozaru?

350
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,190
Do all ninja have to say "gozaru" at the end of each phrase?

351
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,310
Not "gozaru." I'm Katsura.

352

But you can't possibly become a ninja overnight...

Still, could you at least come with us, Sa-san?

356

"-Chan" is fine.

There's no time to lose, Sa-kun.

I said you can call me Sachan, dumb-ass!

359

Sorry, but I have past connections to Bakufu people, so I can't do anything stupid.

See? I've got a call for work...

Hmph. You're awfully firm with me.

Why are you blushing? Why?

364
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,120
You don't have connections with the Bakufu anymore. So you can help...

Hey! What are you doing?! Hurry up and bring my damn tea!

Yes, sir! I'll be right with you, gozaru.

Oh! My glasses...

Hey, over here.

378
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,490
You left your glasses here.

379
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,260
Tough luck, Sachan, you're really careless...

Whatever you do, you must be inconspicuous!

388
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,390
You call this inconspicuous? Look at us! Are we the Go-Rangers?!

389
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,850
Well, anyways, I can't tell your faces apart.

390

Everyone but Gin-san looks the same to me.

Why don't we just wear name tags?!

Oh, Gin-san, your scarf isn't tied right.

393

You're so careless... You can't do anything without me.

By the way, why is my color yellow?

The leader is supposed to wear red. I want red.

398
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,150
Don't fight me on this, Zura. Red is my symbol color. So I'm the leader.

It's not very convincing, but it's fine if I have no other choice.

As the leader, I make the orders.
