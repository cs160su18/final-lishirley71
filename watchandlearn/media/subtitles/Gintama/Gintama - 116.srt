00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,570
This is it. You think we
can use this cave?

6
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,890
It'll at least put a roof over our heads.

7
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,450
There's a skeleton, though.

8
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,850
These are the remains of someone
who drifted to this island like we did.

9
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,940
If we don't come up with a plan to
escape soon, we'll end up like that.

10
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,320
Huh? Shinpachi-san?

11
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,940
K-Kamenashi-san?!

12
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,260
I've been looking for you...

13
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,820
Don't give me that! Where the hell
have you been, you stupid turtle?!

14
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Ow. Hey, let go...

15
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,290
How dare you repay my
kindness with ill will!

16
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,990
You were going to take
us to Ryugu Palace?!

17
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,970
Because of you, we're stuck
on this deserted island!

18
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,260
Shinpachi-kun, calm down.

19
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,780
Huh? Hey... What are you
saying? Deserted island?

20
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,650
This is a deserted island! How could
you do this? There's nothing here!

21
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,980
Huh? This isn't a deserted Island.
This is Ryugu Palace.

22
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,230
Wh-What the hell kind of nonsense
are you taking about?!

23
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,950
Of all the things to say!

24
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,000
If this is Ryugu Palace, then my toilet
is also Ryugu Palace, damn it!

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,330
Calm down, Shinpachi-kun!

26
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,960
If your toilet is Ryugu Palace, is it okay to say
that my microwave is also Ryugu Palace?

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,630
I can say that, right?

28
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,960
I don't care!

29
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,550

30
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,030
Did you find something?

31
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,390
Sis!

32
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,440
We found food! Today, we'll
be dining on turtle stew!

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,370
Oh my.

34
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,960
Wait, wait, wait! I'm serious!
This is Ryugu Palace!

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,650
I swear on kelp! No, I swear on seaweed!

36
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,310
That's pretty much the same thing!

[Ryugu Palace, 3-chome, 2-5-3]

Well, I'm really glad that everyone's safe.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,770
I never expected you guys would
wash up near my house.

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,060
What?! Hey, wait! What?!

43
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,930
R-Ryugu Palace! This is Ryugu Palace?!

44
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,790
Yes. Well, this IS Ryugu Palace,
but this is the very outskirts of it.

45
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,960
Pretty much near Saitama prefecture.

46
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,650
N-No way!

47
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,010
Then how do you explain that?!

48
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,010
There's a dead body in Ryugu Palace!

49
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,090
No matter how I look at it, that was
someone who got lost at sea here!

50
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,150
Oh, this is my wife.

51
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,220
What?! Your wife?! This is your wife?!

52
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,640
She's not dead.

53
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,710
She just gets really tired when she's laying
eggs and tends to grow very thin.

54
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,780
She even stops moving.

55
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,170
Thin? She's a skeleton!

56
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,850
Midori, say hello to everyone.

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,400
Sorry, my wife is a bit shy.

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,660
She's not shy. She's a lot of things
but shy isn't one of them!

Oh well...

62
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,700
One more month until the due date,
huh? I understand your suffering.

63
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,720
I'll help you out. Just lay
some healthy eggs.

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,860
She's beyond help!

65
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,830
Make sure you put your shell
on when you sleep.

66
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,570
What's the meaning of this?

67
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,610
Anyway, it seems that this
isn't a deserted island.

68
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,830
Does that mean we can return
to our normal lives?

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,940
All right! We can leave! I'm
sick of Ryugu Palace!

70
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,670
We had a lot of complications, but I'll
have no complaints if we can leave!

71
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,810
Let's get out of this place right now.

72
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,430
Hey, turtle! Get us off of this island immediately!
We're sick of this place!

73
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,560
Where will you go back to?

74
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,640
Huh?

75
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,110
There's nothing for you
to return to anymore.

76
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,450
Wh-What is that?

77
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,120
Turtles?! An armada of turtles
is headed this way!

78
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,680
Run away!

79
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,730
Hey...

80
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,790
What is that?

81
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,360
Just take a look at the terrible
thing that's happening to Edo.

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,490
Machines that look like turtles suddenly appeared
and dropped mysterious boxes.

83
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,010
The gas emitted from these boxes is turning
everyone in Edo into old fogies.

84
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,390
What's happening?

85
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,980
What exactly are those turtles,
those boxes, and that gas?

86
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,690
Back to the studio.

87
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,860
Hanano announcer, some people claim
that this is some sort of bio-terrorism.

88
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,850
Have you received any information
concerning that?

89
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:32,060
Umm, well... I forgot.

90
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,500
Hanano announcer? That's odd.

91
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,650
The video feed doesn't seem
to be coming in very well.

92
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,550
Out of the way old lady! Well, let's
cut to a commercial break for now.

93
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,240
Edo's being turned into
a city full of old people!

94
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,610
What's the meaning of this?!
What happened to Edo?

95
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,410
That's the Treasure Box G,

96
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,990
a weapon developed in Ryugu
Palace that hastens old age.

97
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,050
Ryugu Palace?! Ryugu Palace
launched that attack on Edo?!

98
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,950
What's the meaning of this? Isn't
this Ryugu Palace, too?!

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,860
Don't tell me you're an enemy, too!

100
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,570
If I was your enemy, I wouldn't have
taken the time to bring you here.

101
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,300
It's dark at the root of seaweed.

102
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:16,160
[Note: A parody of the Japanese proverb "It's dark at the base of a lighthouse," which means "People often know little of what is happening right under their noses."]

103
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,440
You mean, "It's dark at the
base of a lighthouse.

104
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,160
Kamenashi-san, did you bring
us to this island to save us...

105
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,660
from that disaster?

106
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,600
That's half right and half wrong.

107
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,850
I brought you all here because
I believe you are

108
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,010
the only people who can crush
Otohime and her plan.

109
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,900
Look over there!

110
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,430
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry
up! Don't waste time.

111
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,470
You stupid, slow turtles! Do you want
me to whack you onto your backs?

112
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,820
Kamenashi!! Come on out!

113
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,760
You're the captain of the brothel
owner's bodyguards!

114
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,810
We're going to punish you with death for
starting a revolt against Otohime-sama.

115
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,700
We know you're harboring Earthlings!
All Earthlings are to be annihilated!

116
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,490
All you Earthlings...

117
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,860
Surrender immediately!

118
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,090
Tsk! He's on to me. Let's go.

119
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,180
Huh? Hey... Wait!

120
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,960
There he is!

121
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,580
Over there! It's Kamenashi!

122
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,660
Hey! What's going on?!

123
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,360
We came here to have
a fun summer vacation!

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,820
We're on summer vacation!

125
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,080
I'll give it to you straight.

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,510
Otohime, the ruler of Ryugu Palace,
plans to conquer this planet.

127
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,830
At this rate, Earth will become
a planet full of only the elderly!

128
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,390
I discovered her plan and went
looking for the bravest people

129
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,270
who could defeat Otohime and her plan!

130
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,220
[Doraimon]

131
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,240
But I was forced into committing
evil deeds while I searched

132
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,750
for the right people who had pure
souls and could not tolerate evil!

133
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes! You are those people!

134
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,840
You weren't forced!

135
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,480
You abandoned your wife.

136
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,180
Why are you running away with
such voyeuristic-looking videos.

137
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,550
What's with the "Doraimon" label?! You're
completely trying to disguise them!

138
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,570
There are turtles everywhere.
We're completely surrounded.

139
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,930
We've been cornered!! What do we do?!

140
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,580
Crap! Of all times, why are the people
we can rely on the most not here?!

141
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,430
Try your best to hold out!

142
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,830
Just a little longer.

143
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,250
I'm sure they'll come.

144
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey! What are you doing?

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,580
Gin-san will...

146
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,640
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

147
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,870
Gin-san...

148
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,020
I'm coming right over. Wait for me.

149
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,430
Shin, Shin...what was it?

150
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,720
It's Shinichiro-kun. You've gotten big.

151
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,950
Come here. I'll give you 50 yen.

152
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,110
Umm... Who are these old guys?

153
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,840
It's Gin-chan and Zura.

154
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,370
I'm not "Zura." I'm Ka, Ka...

155
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,670
What was I saying?

156
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,370
[Note: Parody of Kamille Bidan from GUNDAM Z.]

157
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,370
I believe you were saying something
about Kamille Bidan.

158
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,110
That's right. Ka, Ka...

159
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,720
Don't tell me you touched the sample

160
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,040
Treasure Box G I snuck
out of Ryugu Palace.

161
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,180
What sample?

162
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,780
I don't know.

163
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,500
Anyway, I've been wondering:
Who are you?

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,790
Who are you?

165
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,530
No way!!

166
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,780
Excuse me.

167
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,780
We have captured the rebellious
former captain of the guard,

168
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,150
Kamenashi, along with six Earthlings
and one Amanto.

169
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:39,620
Yes. Good work. I commend you. Kamenashi
is to be immediately executed.

170
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,850
Use a treasure box on the
rest of the Earthlings.

171
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,760
Understood.

172
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,150
Now all the beautiful people
on this planet will disappear.

173
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,770
I have no need of anyone in this world
who is more beautiful than me.

174
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,990
I am the most beautiful
creature in the world.

175
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,230
I, Otohime, the ruler of Ryugu.

176
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,940
Look, look! Look at all the fish swimming!

177
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,810
This is like a dream!

178
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,480
I never dreamed of being able to spend
summer vacation at Ryugu Palace!

179
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,010
Pops Matsudaira, thank you so much!

180
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,390
This is the life.

181
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,640
Only you beautiful girls

182
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,180
of Cabaret Smile can wash
away the filth in my world.

183
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,690
I'll be the one who serves you today.

184
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,600
Have as much fun as you like.

185
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,570
Matchan, I love you!

186
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,740
All right! Bring me some Dom Perignon!

187
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,330
He's not doing anything here that
he doesn't do at the hostess club.

188
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,570
He's apparently a VIP member.

189
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,160
He always spends his summers here.
Celebrities really are spoiled.

190
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,130
That's so true. Otae-chan should
have come with us.

191
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,910
I can't get in touch with her.
I wonder what she's doing.

192
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,080
It's not every day you get
to come to Ryugu Palace.

193
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,750
That's true. I thought it was just
the product of a folktale.

194
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,800
It's really just a super exclusive
luxury resort, isn't it?

195
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,460
After all, Urashima-han had fun here
until he became an old man.

196
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,460
[Note: Hanako is talking with an Osaka accent.]

197
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,290
We shouldn't overdo it.

198
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,230
Tsk, tsk, tsk. This place isn't
such an easygoing place.

199
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,430
Ryugu Palace used to be a
giant mobile luxury brothel.

200
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,760
It used to travel between planet nations.

201
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,360
It doesn't belong to any country.

202
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,370
As an organization that
is beyond the law,

203
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,830
it's received many favors
from powerful people

204
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,070
and has gained enormous influence.

205
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,560
Right now, it's a moving palace,

206
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,360
no, a city-state that has as much
power as a single country.

207
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,450
Why does a palace with that much
power stay in these waters?

208
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,520
Huh? Well...

209
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,810
Uh, hold on a second.

210
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,560
Hello? Huh? I'm at Ryugu
Palace right now.

211
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,740
Ah! The Dom Perignon is here!

212
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,110
What could this be?

213
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,790
Huh?

214
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,690
Edo has been turned into a
city full of elderly chumps?

215
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,890
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

216
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,500
They're still bringing in the people
who have been turned old.

217
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,390
We're going to become like that, too.

218
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,850
I'm not sure what she's up to,

219
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,570
but it looks like Otohime really wants to

220
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,230
turn this country into nothing
but old people.

221
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,550
What are we going to do?

222
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,240
The turtle was taken somewhere else,

223
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,510
we can't move, and those
two are still like that.

224
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,160
[Note: Elderly people in Japan like to watch sumo.]

225
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,160
Why have they been watching
sumo all day?

226
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,340
Why is there a TV in this cell?

227
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,820
Gin-chan, what are you eating?

228
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,910
He's not eating. He just
doesn't have any teeth.

229
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,180
What are you secretly
eating by yourself?

230
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,860
He's not eating anything.

231
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,300
Give it to me!

232
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,330
I want to eat it, too!

233
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,790
Kagura-chan, he's not eating anything!

234
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,170
And were you really going to
eat what was in his mouth?!

235
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,390
Hand it over!

236
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,740
Shut up! Why are you
making such a fuss?!

237
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,560
Don't just stay indoors all day.

238
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,410
Children should play outside,
you lazy bums!

239
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,430
Then get rid of the iron bars, you old fart!

240
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,850
I want to... I want to eat it, too!

241
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,710
Honestly. Young people these days...

242
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,870
[Note: Family Computer (Famicom) = NES.
Mega Drive = Sega Master System.]

243
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,870
They have their Family Computers
and their Mega Drives...

244
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,380
They stay in the house all the time.

245
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,810
All of your examples are old.

246
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,490
When Gintoki and I were young,

247
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,290
we would run around the mountains and only
play with our Mega Drives in our free time.

248
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,700
In the end, you played with them, too!

249
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,800
Zura, you...

250
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,860
In the end you played with
the Mega Drive, too.

251
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,330
You took way too long to comment!

252
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,220
How long of a pause do you need?!

253
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,870
I already commented on that.

254
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,950
You don't need to push yourself.
Just leave it to me.

255
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,600
Don't treat me like an old geezer.

256
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,800
I still won't lose to you young folks.

257
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,600
As I would have expected
of you, Gintoki.

258
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Young people are so rude
and unrefined these days.

259
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,620
When we were young...

260
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,280
These guys are really annoying!

261
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,430
Let's ignore them the next time
they say something silly.

262
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,460
What on earth happened?

263
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,620
They've completely became old geezers.

264
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,840
Do you think there's a way
to turn them back?

265
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,010
We probably have to ask
Otohime in person.

266
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,860
I don't think she'll just tell us, though.

267
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,490
It's not a big deal if we leave
them like this, is it?

268
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,590
Gin-san was always like this, wasn't he?

269
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,290
No, he was a little brighter, Sis.

270
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,830
No, he was kind of like this.

271
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,970
He's always had white hair and
he's been kind of like this

272
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,060
since we've been on the
air for three years.

273
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,510
You are all just as lazy as him!

274
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,530
Hey...

275
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,960
It's all right. I already commented,
so you don't need to say anything.

276
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,440
In the end you played with
the Mega Drive, too.

277
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,470
You said that already. That's
the wrong comment.

278
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,950
I want one of you to come
with me. You there...

279
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,800
Come with me.

280
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,860
Wait, I'll go, too...

281
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,110
Take care of everyone.

282
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,520
Sis!

283
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,480
Crap!

284
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,380
What should we do? What
in the world do we do?

285
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,470
Let's defeat Otohime.

286
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,200
Let's save Otae-chan,

287
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,280
turn everyone back to normal
and crush Otohime's plan.

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,660
Now that everyone on this
planet has become old,

289
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,140
we're the only ones who can do it.

290
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,560
But how?

291
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,680
Keep walking!

292
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,950
Please spare my life.

293
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,580
It's too late to beg for your life now!

294
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,520
You can regret ever becoming an enemy
of Otohime-sama in the next world!

295
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,830
Kamenashi...

296
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,800
Quickly, grab the keys!

297
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,250
Good work, Kamenashi!

298
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,730
You did it, Kagura-chan.

299
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,380
What was the point of me doing that?!

300
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,950
What are you doing?!

301
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,660
Fire!

302
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,430
Out of the way, old man!

303
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,780
You don't have much
longer, so let me live!

304
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:37,090
You probably won't have a decent
life anyway, so let me live.

305
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,020
Katsura-san, what are
you doing?! Look out!

306
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,150
[Note: "Matsu" means pine tree.]

307
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,150
I'm not "Katsura," I'm "Matsu."

308
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,550
Even though he's an old geezer,
he really hasn't changed at all!

309
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,220
There's been a prison break!

310
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,080
Kamenashi's escaped!

311
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,690
Six of his accomplices are with
him! If you find them, kill them!

312
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,120
Hey, hey, is this really all right?

313
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,320
We're finished if they find us.

314
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,840
Act like a turtle.

315
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,730
If you make any suspicious moves,
they'll notice immediately.

316
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,060
Act like a turtle? You're barely a turtle.

317
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,450
You're just some guy.

318
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,680
Don't forget to add "kelp" and "seaweed"
to the end of your sentences.

319
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,230
You don't do that.

320
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,150
Hey, what's wrong? Hang in there!

321
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,970
She's getting ready to lay eggs!
Someone call for help!

322
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,410
She's going to lay eggs!

323
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,960
It's all right. We'll look after
her. Sorry for the trouble.

324
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,910
That's too realistic!

325
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,960
But he said to act like a turtle.

326
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,000
Cut it out.

327
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,340
What were you planning to do if the
enemy realized who you were?!

328
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,830
You were gonna try it too, huh?!

329
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,830
[Note: Sea turtle eggs look a lot like pong pong balls.]

330
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,060
Why else would you be holding
ping pong balls?!

331
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,440
Well, I got it from them.

332
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,600
Come on. Don't be afraid.
Open your eyes!

333
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,930
Keep your eye on the balls!

334
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,950
[Note: Refers to the Three Kameda Brothers, a boxing trio, who dodged ping pong balls as part of their training. "Kame" in "Kameda" means "turtle" in Japanese.]

335
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,820
That's definitely Kameda!
And that's so old!!

336
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,950
Hey! All of you, cut it out!

337
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,980
This is more clowning around
than you've ever done before.

338
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,880
I can't handle all of this by myself.

339
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,790
I'm not acting silly, Shinpachi-kun.

340
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,200
In the end you played with
the Mega Drive, too.

341
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,800
I don't need your help!

342
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,880
Otohime-sama, I've brought
you one of the prisoners.

343
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,870
Honestly, they sure are stubborn.
They still want to defy me?

344
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,200
I commend them on their persistence.

345
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,560
Are you Otohime-sama?

346
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,710
You called me here and you're not
even going to show me your face?

347
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,340
Or is your face so ugly you
can't show anyone?

348
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,430
What a spirited young girl. My apologies.

349
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,550
I heard there was a young
lady amongst the rebels.

350
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,310
I called you here because
I wanted to see your face.

351
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:55,070
I was once the Captain of Otohime's
bodyguards at Ryugu Palace.

352
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:01,090
Yes, back then Otohime was a
sparkling pearl of the ocean.

353
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,800
Ryugu Palace was a paradise that
soared across the universe.

354
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,200
We weren't bound by anyone and
we didn't encroach upon anyone.

355
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,560
We were a free country.

356
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,810
Do you want to know why Ryugu Palace
has dwelled in the oceans of...

357
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,030
this remote planet for so long?

358
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,730
Long ago, a young man
came to Ryugu Palace.

359
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,710
He had come to the rescue of
one of our messenger turtles.

360
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,530
That kind young man was
specially invited here.

361
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,920
Otohime grew very fond of him and
gave him a warm reception.

362
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,770
But Ryugu Palace flies far distances
between planet nations.

363
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,460
And time moves very differently
than it does on Earth.

364
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,350
When the man returned to Earth...

365
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,950
Everyone he loved was gone.

366
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,040
Upon hearing this, Otohime
became very sorrowful.

367
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,190
She sunk Ryugu Palace into the
seas of this small island nation

368
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,750
and it has never left since.

369
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,440
She discarded her position and honor

370
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,000
so this tragedy would
never happen again.

371
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,120
She used to be so kind,
noble, and beautiful.

372
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,390
But little by little she changed.

373
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,240
Don't worry.

374
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,840
If you were a young and beautiful girl
I wasn't just going to make you old,

375
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,660
I would've taken your life.

376
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,420
But since you're not, I can toss
you aside. I'm much cuter.

377
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,630
Huh?! Bring it on!

378
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,460
Show your face! Let's settle
this fairly, you wench!

379
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,490
Huh?! You want to fight?! You
think you can beat me?!

380
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,820
As Otohime grew older and passed
the 2,000 year mark,

381
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,970
she became more obsessed
with staying beautiful.

382
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,860
She sent her soldiers everywhere

383
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,210
in search of ways to keep herself young.

384
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,710
She even used up all the public
funds on stupid research.

385
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,700
The country quickly became bankrupt.

386
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,650
And in the end we ended
up creating a device

387
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,020
that for some reason made people
not younger, but older.

388
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,770
The Treasure Box G.

389
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,970
Otohime gave up her quest for
eternal youth and beauty.

390
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,490
And decided to use the box as revenge

391
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,140
against those who had what
she no longer did.

392
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,700
In other words, she planned to turn

393
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,470
all the people of Earth into old geezers.

394
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,160
You're just a young brat, that's all!

395
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,900
If I was younger... If only
I was younger...

396
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,880
Your age isn't your only problem, tramp!

397
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
