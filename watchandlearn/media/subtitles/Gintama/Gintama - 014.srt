Okay, this week's Gin is in three parts like that popular nationally known anime.

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,100
[Today's episode is three parts like that popular nationally known anime.]

4
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,090
[Now enjoy the commercials our sponsors have prepared for you!]

5
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,660
I think all of you already know this,

6
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,960
but yesterday a ship belonging to the Harusame outer space pirates was sunk.

7
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,870
And-now listen up, you jackasses-

8
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,470
that ship was apparently destroyed by just two samurai.

9
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,070
Surprised? Nobody's even listening!

10
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,960
Toshi...

11
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,490
I think you already know,

12
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,740
but yesterday a ship belonging to the Harusame outer space pirates was sunk.

13
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,640
And-act surprised when you hear this, guys-

14
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,250
that ship was apparently destroyed by just two samurai.

15
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,020
What?! Really?!

16
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,180
You guys are so phony. Act more sincere or I'll...

17
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,840
Toshi, forget it. Otherwise we'll never get finished.

18
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,800
We have reports that one of the two was Katsura of the Anti-Alien Rebel Faction.

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,180
He's about the only guy who could pull off a stunt like this.

20
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,620
The Harusame were smuggling large quantities of illegal drugs into Edo and selling them.

21
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,900
Even if you take the anti-Amanto out of the equation,

22
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,730
I understand how they couldn't forgive the pirates.

23
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,660
But the real problem, starts here.

24
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,860
Rumor has it that a Shogunate officer was involved in the drug ring.

25
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,660
In return for his cooperation,

26
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,020
he received a taste of the profits.

27
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,320
The authenticity of this information is uncertain,

28
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,710
but the anti-Amanto ronin scattered throughout Edo have picked up on these rumors

29
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,980
and are planning assassinations. They are saying the scoundrels should be killed.

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,250
That's where we come in!

31
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,260
["Boys Have a Weird Ritual that Makes Them Think They Turn Into Men When They Touch a Frog"]

32
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,350
You bastard...

33
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,230
Even when you're asleep your face pisses me off.

34
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,770
Hey, wake up jerk! What kind of retard sleeps on guard duty?!

35
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:50,280
Give me a break, Mom... Today's Sunday. Yer such a moron!

36
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,820
Today is Tuesday!

37
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,020
You nitwit... What if the Anti-Alien Rebel Faction stormed this place while you were goofing off?!

38
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,740
Stop treating your work with such contempt.

39
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,410
When did I ever treat work with contempt?

40
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm treating you with contempt, Hijikata!

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,320
Fine! We'll fight right now-draw your sword!

42
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,590
Why're you playing around on duty?!

43
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,150
What do you think this is?! Some kind of school excursion?!

44
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,970
Would you care to have pillow fight, little girls?!

45
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,470
You're the loudest of them all!

46
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm nervous enough without all this racket!

47
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,500
We're sorry.

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,780
Good grief, you filthy apes are totally incompetent.

49
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,180
What's with that guy? We're the ones putting our lives on the line to guard him!

50
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,940
You were asleep.

51
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,610
He may be some big shot in the Shogunate official, but why do we have to protect that toad?

52
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,040
Sogo, we're lucky the Shogunate picked us up.

53
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,500
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for the Shogunate.

54
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,950
It is a samurai's cherished ambition to repay a debt with loyalty!

55
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,000
The swords of the Shinsengumi exist to protect the Shogunate!

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,580
But they might be in cahoots with the pirates.

57
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,560
I just can't get enthusiastic about this job. Don't you agree, Hijikata?

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,850
I'm always enthusiastic.

59
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,340
Look at them. They've all lost interest.

60
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,460
Check out Yamazaki - he's playing freakin' badminton!

61
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,690
Yamazaki!

62
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,860
What're you doing, you nimrod?!

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,940
Sogo, stop thinking so much about it.

64
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,520
If the life of a guy in front of you is in danger,

65
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,190
whether he's a good guy or not, you gotta give him a hand.

66
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,650
That's the way a man should live his life.

67
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,210
Just a minute!

68
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,510
Please don't go out on your own!

69
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,970
Wait!

70
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,500
That guy's such a wimp, letting people walk all over him.

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,930
Wait, Kinya! It's too dangerous. I'm telling you!

72
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,820
Enough! I'm sick of living cooped up in here!

73
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,490
Your life is in danger. Do you understand?

74
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,760
What's the difference when apes like you are guarding me!

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,170
We may be apes but we're apes with the steely souls of Bushido!

76
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,770
Don't underestimate us!

77
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,170
What're you talking about? You're nothing but a country bumpkin samurai!

78
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,040
Ribbit! Curse you, Daraku! This wouldn't have happened if he hadn't screwed up.

79
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,110
Huh? Rakuda?

80
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,480
Look out!

81
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,410
Chief!

82
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,000
Yamazaki!

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,900
On it!

84
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,380
Kondo! Hang on!

85
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,930
Hmph. Even an ape is useful as a primate shield.

86
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,080
Don't do it.

87
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,510
Your pupils are dilated.

88
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,660
The sniper belonged to the Anti-Amanto ronin group known as the "Back to the Stars Faction."

89
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,880
They're separate from Katsura's group, but they're no less radical.

90
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,500
Is that so?

91
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,490
I'm responsible for what happens this time.

92
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,060
I handled everything foolishly from the chain of command to the positioning of my officers.

93
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,830
I'll have to start over again.

94
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,180
Vice-chief!

95
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,850
He treated you like that, and you still want to protect him?!

96
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,810
The bastard thinks humans are nothing but trash.

97
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,830
He doesn't even care about Kondo, who took the bullet for him.

98
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,420
Vice-chief, I know you didn't order it, but I took a look around the villa.

99
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,420
A mess of drugs turned up in the warehouse...

100
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,280
Without a doubt, he's guilty.

101
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,290
To be protecting a guy like that...

102
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,060
What on earth has the Shogunate come to?

103
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,990
Hmph... A bit late for that.

104
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,510
The Shogunate doesn't even serve humanity now.

105
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,900
We knew that a long time ago.

106
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,650
So why do you lend your sword?

107
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,990
Is it to protect the Shogunate?

108
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,230
Is it to protect the Shogun?

109
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,760
Not me...

110
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,860
Do you remember how it used to be?

111
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,950
Remember those days when we were like thugs.

112
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,950
Uneducated rogues who knew nothing but how to swing a sword?

113
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,720
Who was it that welcomed us into a special dojo?

114
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,240
Who was it that refused to forsake us even after the order to outlaw swords was issued?

115
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,900
After we lost our dojo and were stripped of our swords?

116
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,770
Who was it who gave us back our swords?

117
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,430
It wasn't the Shogunate, and it wasn't the Shogun.

118
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,550
He's been our only boss since then.

119
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,370
The boss says to protect this frog...then that's all there is to it.

120
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,080
I'll protect him, no matter what he is.

121
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,750
If you don't like that, then go home. I won't stop you.

122
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,500
What're you doing?! Hey!

123
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,760
Don't worry. He isn't dead.

124
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,830
I mean, we just have to protect him, right?

125
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,450
This way, we'll smoke the enemy out into the open...and then we'll wipe 'em out!

126
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,770
I'm being proactive.

127
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,820
Rogues! Don't think you can get away with this!

128
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:02,600
Hijikata, I feel the same way you do. I'm here because I like Kondo.

129
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,230
But he's just too much of a nice guy.

130
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,650
He can see what's good in people but he doesn't try to see the bad.

131
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,030
With wicked thugs like you and me, Hijikata,

132
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,200
the Shinsengumi has just the right balance.

133
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,870
Ahh, it's going to be cold tonight.

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,660
Throw another log on the fire, Sogo.

135
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,540
Yes, sir!

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,300
Prepare for your reckoning!

137
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,290
Scoundrel!

138
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,490
We've come to slay you!

139
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,470
Out of our way, Shogunate dogs!

140
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,300
Do you think you samurai wannabes can defeat a true samurai?!

141
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,880
See? My plan is flawless.

142
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,510
Lets kick the crap out of them!

143
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,530
You guys are so quick to jump into a fight.

144
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,270
Don't let Toshi and Sogo have all the fun!

145
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,480
Protect the stupid toad!

146
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,470
Let's go!

"The Shinsengumi showed their mettle by arresting anti-Amanto ronin en masse."

148
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,120
"Shock at Shogunate VIP's collusion with crime syndicate..."

149
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,970
Gin...

150
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,900
Huh?

151
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,310
What's "collision" mean?

152
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,690
Hey, don't play dumb, perm boy!

153
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:34,140
["You Only Gotta Wash Under Your Armpits - Just the Armpits"]

154
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,150
You're an unfamiliar face. Where're you from?

155
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:44,020
This park belongs to Yo... Emperor of Kabukicho!

156
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,070
If you wanna play here, you had better cough up three Dokkiti-man chocolate stickers, girlie!

157
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,190
What's that? "Dorky-man"?

158
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,080
Is that what's popular outside the castle walls?

159
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,320
Not "Dorky," "Dokkiri"!  No, wait, maybe it's "Gessori"...

160
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,100
No, Yo, it's "Batsu and Terri".

161
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,530
No, you're mistaken.

162
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,470
You're thinking of "Gory-man."

163
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,660
It bit me!

164
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,850
Y...You...

165
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,360
The swings around here belong to me, Kagura, Queen of Kabukicho.

166
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,830
If you want to ride them, it'll cost you a year's supply of pickled seaweed, okay?

167
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,800
A year's supply? I don't even know how much you eat in one day!

168
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,780
Damn you! We won't forget this!

169
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
We won't forget this!

170
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,990
Hmph. Small fry.

171
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,910
You saved me, Queen of Kabukicho.

172
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,480
Thank you very much.

173
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,970
Don't mention it.

174
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,940
More importantly, you'd better not come around here anymore.

175
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,060
This is the most dangerous part of Edo.

176
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,230
Please wait.

177
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,280
What's...that you're eating?

178
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,130
What's is this?! It's so sour!

179
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,370
Even more sour than my manny's underarms!

180
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,570
You get hooked on the flavor.

181
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,270
You'll be addicted to your manny's underarms soon too!

182
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,740
I will not! That's gross!

183
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,140
So people beyond the castle walls eat this sort of thing.

184
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,230
This is all new to me.

185
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,040
You're not from around here, are you, miss?

186
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,500
Gin and all the losers who live here reek of poverty, but you smell nice, miss.

187
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,120
You're correct. I came from over there.

188
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,600
Oh, that's a huge mansion.

189
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,900
Gin told me once, that the most important samurai in the land used to live there.

190
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,330
But, after the Amanto came,

191
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,480
it's become nothing more than window dressing.

192
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,560
Now it's just where the most pathetic samurai live.

193
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:46,440
Yes, that's right. No one in this country honors that castle anymore.

194
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,710
It's an artificial castle that exists only for show.

195
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,700
A mirage. I wish it would just collapse.

196
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,590
Then I would be free...

197
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,610
Miss, is something troubling you?

198
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,770
I'll listen to your pathetic tales of woe.

199
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,890
Jack-of-all-trades Kagura-that's me!

200
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,030
You have so many different names.

201
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,900
Hmm...something that's troubling me...

202
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,720
Right.

203
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,500
Will you be my friend for one day today?

204
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,570
Man, it's hot.

205
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,710
Why do our uniforms have to be so thick and heavy?

206
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,200
Everyone's wearing lightweight clothes but us!

207
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,830
And to boot, we have to go hunt someone down in this heat!

208
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,030
Give me a freakin' break!

209
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,350
If you're that hot, I'll make you a summer uniform, Hijikata...

210
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,440
That was close! Stop squirming, it's dangerous.

211
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,990
You're the one who's dangerous! What's the big idea?!

212
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,820
What's with you? I was about to make your uniform sleeveless.

213
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,550
Don't give me that! You were trying to cut off my arms!

214
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,250
Actually, I'm marketing the summer uniforms I proposed.

215
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,160
How 'bout it, Hijikata?

216
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,320
You'll look like a rocker.

217
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,290
Only a moron would wear something like that!

218
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,310
Hey, how's the search going?

219
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:22,510
Finding underground terrorists is my specialty, but finding her is another story.

220
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,310
What was the princess thinking running away from home like that?

221
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,500
Rich, fancy people have a different set of worries.

222
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,820
Though I can't imagine what troubles a princess might have.

223
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,520
Even so, she's still a young woman of a delicate age.

224
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,150
You know... Maybe her pop's been giving her horny looks,

225
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,460
or he had bad body odor. It could be all sorts of things.

226
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,680
So it's all about her father, is it?

227
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,650
It's impossible to cover every street in Edo using regular methods.

228
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,580
Why don't we just throw a party and invite the princess?

229
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,520
Only you would fall for a trap that sounds straight out of a Japanese folktale!

230
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,500
Chief!

231
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,040
What is it, Yamazaki?

232
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,840
We have a sighting!

233
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,790
The princess was spotted heading toward Kabukicho.

234
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,170
Kabukicho?

235
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,530
Of all the annoying places...

236
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,160
Okay, place your bets! Even or odd?!

237
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,900
Odd!

238
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,650
Odd for me, too!

239
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,550
Even!

240
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,240
Then, I'll take even.

241
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,010
Odd!

242
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,210
Even!

243
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,430
The bets are down! Snake-eyes. Even!

244
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,130
Lost again!

245
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,440
This ain't good. I can't go home now!

246
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,360
You're awesome! You're younger than me, yet you know so much.

247
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,940
I suppose I do.

248
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,180
All that's left is to go have a drink and stay out till morning. That's what the kids do.

249
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,350
Though, of course, everything I know, I heard from Gin.

250
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,820
Your Highness is so lucky. You're so free.

251
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,970
I hardly ever left the castle,

252
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,430
so I don't have friends and I don't know anything about the outside world.

253
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,630
All I can do

254
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,420
is gaze out at the distant city and use my imagination,

255
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,590
wishing I could skip along without a care in the world and go out,

256
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,490
free to play.

257
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,950
Live freely.

258
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,740
Once I started thinking like that, before I knew it, I had to run away from the castle.

259
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,100
But from the very start, I decided that it would be for only one day.

260
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,470
If I were to vanish, it would cause grief for so many people.

261
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,120
You're exactly right.

262
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,290
So let's go back.

263
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,130
What are you doing?!

264
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,410
Hey, wait!

265
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,470
Get them!

266
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,980
Out of our way!

267
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,810
She leapt onto the roof carrying the princess!

268
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,320
Who is she?!

269
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,790
Isn't she that Hercules girl from the Odd Jobs place?

270
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,120
Why's she with the princess?

271
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Beats me.

272
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,520
Hey! Sogo! What're you doing, taking out the heavy artillery?!

273
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,700
I don't like taking roundabout methods.

274
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,210
Wait! What if you hit the princess?!

275
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,960
I won't make that mistake.

276
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,610
It's always been my dream to one day be known as the "Sniper."

277
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,580
Hey!

278
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,050
You're saying you just aspire to be a good shot?

279
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,200
A man can realize his strength better

280
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,240
when he's chasing his dream than after he's caught it.

281
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,160
No!

282
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,560
Hey! Come on out!

283
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,610
I don't know how you became acquainted with Soyo, but she's very important to this country.

284
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,340
If you cause us any more trouble, I'll have to arrest you, too.

285
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,380
Are you listening to me?!

286
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,020
Your Highness, you've done enough. I'll go home.

287
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,500
Why? Don't you wanna be free?

288
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,560
I'll free you.

289
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,830
I want to be free...

290
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,050
but I don't wish to cause Your Highness any more trouble.

291
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,480
You're no trouble.

292
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,760
We made a promise: to be friends all day today.

293
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,180
I don't need a reason to help a friend.

294
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,560
That's the spirit of Edo.

295
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,790
I've still for a lot of fun things to teach you!

296
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,320
That's right, we're friends.

297
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,930
But,

298
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,620
that's exactly why I don't want to cause you trouble.

299
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,230
Thank you ever so much for your kindness, Your Highness.

300
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,600
Although it was only for half a day, I felt as though I was just a regular girl.

301
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,250
It made me very happy.

302
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,020
Farewell.

303
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,820
Wait! That's not fair!

304
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,300
You made a promise yourself, and now you're just going to break it?!

305
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,980
I want to play with you some more!

306
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,180
I wanna be friends with you, Soyo!

307
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,470
This isn't fair!

308
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,910
Yes, I am being unfair.

309
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,050
That's why I have one last unfair favor to ask.

310
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,200
I said "one day,"

311
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,610
but I want you to be my friend forever, okay?

312
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,810
Why're you eating pickled seaweed?

313
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,680
Huh? Because the princess was eating it and she said it tastes good!

314
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,260
Princess Soyo, the Shogun's younger sister,

315
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,040
is widely associated with the unprecedented pickled seaweed boom.

316
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,620
The princess was seen observed at a recent poetry gathering

317
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,700
chewing on a stick of seaweed...

318
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,030
Wow.

319
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,080
A princess who likes pickled seaweed...

320
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,570
Silly! It's got to be a scam.

321
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,900
They just do that kind of thing to pretend to be like us common folk.

322
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,830
They probably feast on fois gras all day at the castle.

323
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,560
I bet they even put sushi on top of their sushi!

324
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,590
Look, there's your real pickled seaweed girl.

325
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,370
See how her sleeping face just reeks of poverty.

326
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,480
Now that's the real thing.

[Another Day of Cooking]

329
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,290
Good afternoon, and welcome to "Another Day of Cooking."

330
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,430
Today's menu is rice omelet.

331
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,330
It's a dish that excites kids both big and small, isn't that right, Sensei?

332
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:58,840
Well, I hate kids, or should I say, why should I have to cook for someone else?

333
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,440
Stop babbling needlessly and get started. Okay, Sensei?

334
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,960
Shinpachi, Kagura, let's put our spirits into this!

335
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,220
Yeah!

336
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,450
We'll begin by making chicken rice.

337
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,060
Sensei, what shall we do first?

338
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,850
Kagura, dice the vegetables into small pieces.

339
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,570
Roger that!

340
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,530
Hey! Why're you destroying the entire kitchen!

341
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,100
One kitchen, finely diced.

342
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,930
Man, you're hopeless.

343
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,150
This is how you cut vegetables.

344
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,220
Watch.

345
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,170
Just like that.

346
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,060
Come on! You can't cut an onion with a wooden sword!

347
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,140
It takes spirit. Spirit!

348
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,930
If you've got spirit you can julienne, shave fine sheets, or anything.

349
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,980
Excuse me, Sensei.

350
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,440
You've been tossing in the ingredients at random.

351
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,520
Could you at least tell us the amounts?

352
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,560
Oh, it doesn't matter. Don't worry about it.

353
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,960
Whatever you feel like.

354
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,630
But this is a cooking show, so you can't just say anything.

355
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,690
Ballpark amounts are the fundamentals of men's cooking.

356
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,400
If you just do what you feel like...

357
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,530
We have cold Chinese noodles with toppings.

358
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,240
When did you put in noodles?!

359
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,230
The ingredients have been cooked until tender.

360
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,740
Isn't it about time for the rice?

361
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,870
Hey! We haven't finished the dish yet!

362
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,700
You're not supposed to eat that!

363
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,520
Can I have seconds?

364
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,750
We're ruined.

365
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,610
Hey, hey, what're we going to do?

366
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,500
We don't have any extra rice at home.

367
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,770
I thought something like this might happen, so I prepared some rice omelet.

368
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,260
You don't think...

369
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,400
It better not be those poor, innocent, abused eggs.

370
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,620
It's art, after all.

371
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,830
Will we die if we don't eat it?

372
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,710
Well, bon appétit.
