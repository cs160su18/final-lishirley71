00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:44,100
Mister, the sun shines above every person.

3
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,480
It gives light to everyone.

4
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:57,400
Why must you hate me, as well?

5
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,730
It shines above you, too...

6
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,770
I'm sure it'll warm your chilled heart...

7
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,470
Why must you reject me, as well?

8
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,970
So, Mister,

9
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,180
don't hate the sun.

10
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,110
Why...  When I desire you so...

11
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,050
I am drying up...

12
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,470
I can see nothing at all...

13
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,510
A true night, where no light can reach...

14
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,550
So, even in death, the King of the Night must walk into the night...

15
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,240
This is...

16
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,950
This light is...

17
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,940
Hi-Hinowa...

18
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,560
["The Taste of Drinking Under Broad Daylight Is Something Special"]

19
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,840
I'm finally able to show you...

20
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,500
I've always wanted to show you this...

21
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,890
Show you this sky...

22
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,230
Didn't I tell you?

23
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,270
I'd help you make up with the sun.

24
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,580
I always knew...

25
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
No matter how arrogant you may be...

26
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,050
No matter how cruel you may be...

27
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,770
You're not the great King of the Night you claimed to be.

28
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,320
This is all you ever wanted, isn't it?

29
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,490
...A simple old man who just wanted to sleep under the sun.

30
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,260
That was all you wanted,

31
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,970
yet you built this foolish city,

32
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,310
turning everyone against you...

33
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,500
What a foolish man...

34
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,920
Really...

35
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,930
What a foolish man.

36
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,280
Hey!

37
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,430
Bravo!

38
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,640
A truly brilliant performance!!

39
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,640
Well, not really...

40
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,180
but I'm truly amazed.

41
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,590
Little flames gathered together

42
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,960
and finally burned through the chains of the King of the Night,

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,080
becoming a sun to shine over Yoshiwara, huh?

44
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,270
I never expected you to actually defeat the King of the Night.

45
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,350
The long trip was worth it.

46
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,560
It's been a while since I witnessed something this entertaining.

47
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,770
But I doubt this will be enough to change Yoshiwara.

48
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,680
The King of the Night was not the only darkness covering Yoshiwara.

49
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,800
There's us, Harusame,

50
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,550
and the Bakufu Central Covert Ops.

51
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,390
Darkness can be found everywhere.

52
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,120
A second or third King of the Night will be born soon enough.

53
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,890
Do you think you can eliminate all of the darkness?

54
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,700
Do you truly believe that you can change Yoshiwara?

55
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,950
It'll change.

56
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,390
A town changes when its people change.

57
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,100
There may be days when the sun doesn't feel like peeking out from behind the clouds,

58
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,470
but their light will never fade again.

59
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,620
Really?

60
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,550
You sound pretty confident.

61
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,970
How about fighting with the second King of the Night right now?

62
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,180
Kamui!

63
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,570
I'm your opponent!

64
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,480
I'll fix that twisted attitude of yours!

65
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,810
You can't, Kagura-chan!

66
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,140
Not in your current condition!

67
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,600
Let me go, stupid four-eyes!

68
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,560
Stop it, Kagura-chan!

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,050
This is surprising.

70
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,810
You're still alive?

71
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,040
It appears that you've gotten a little tougher.

72
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,640
She's not much of a sister, but do take good care of her.

73
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,270
Make her stronger, will ya?

74
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,700
Oh, and you should do some more training too.

75
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey, you!

76
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,360
I'm the kind of person who saves his favorite part of a meal for the end.

77
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,180
In other words, I've taken a liking to you.

78
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,410
Make sure to heal those wounds.

79
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,180
Well, you probably have a lot to deal with, but don't die.

80
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,560
...Until I kill you.

81
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,490
See ya, Mr. Samurai.

82
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,470
Wait, Kamui!

83
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,640
Kamui!

84
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,330
Well, I'll be damned.

85
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,520
The sun has risen above Yoshiwara.

86
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,100
If that's risen up there, then the King of the Night has sunk below?

87
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,090
Who knows.

88
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,920
I have no interest in someone who's lost,

89
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,450
...Abuto.

90
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,140
Aren't you so critical.

91
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,060
I worked my butt off, you know?

92
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,140
After all, I was against a young lady capable of beating the King of the Night.

93
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,700
Right, Big Brother?

94
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,860
Abuto, you've fallen into your bad habit again.

95
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,400
You were like this when you fought me as well.

96
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,560
I don't mind you treasuring your kind,

97
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,220
but losing a fight while holding back your true strength is a disgrace to the Yato.

98
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:21,560
Your love for the Yato blood has lead you to behave in a way shameful to the Yato.

99
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,580
Like I said.

100
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,860
I have no interest in the weak.

101
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,620
I don't recall holding myself back.

102
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,840
Though I can't deny feeling that it would be a waste to end such talent in a place like this.

103
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,520
It was the same way I felt when I met you, captain.

104
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,470
You siblings fascinate me.

105
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,140
I'm very happy.

106
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,810
Promising youngsters coming one after another.

107
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,260
We've got a bright future ahead of us.

108
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,220
This is your era now.

109
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:11,940
[This is a reference to the Japanese myth of rabbits living on the moon pounding mochi.]

110
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,390
Us old bunnies will be returning to the moon with the King of the Night.

111
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,940
Say?

112
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,110
What's going on here?

113
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,670
Abuto.

114
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,430
I felt the same way you did.

115
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,220
I became curious of a man's future and couldn't kill him.

116
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,340
A man who is truly strong is strong in both body and soul.

117
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
This man was far from that.

118
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,730
He had a fragile body and a weak soul bound by worthless beliefs.

119
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,890
Yet that man was able to defeat the King of the Night.

120
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,880
Standing every time he was crushed...

121
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,310
Overcoming impossible odds...

122
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,600
And in the end, he survived on the battlefield.

123
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,850
Interesting, isn't it?

124
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,730
The universe sure is a big place.

125
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,160
It's still too early for us to call ourselves the strongest.

126
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,300
There were still people in this universe

127
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,310
who possessed a totally different form of strength.

128
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,330
The samurai, with a sense of carnage that can rival the Yato.

129
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,170
I can't help but get excited.

130
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,630
He's MY prey.

131
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,180
I won't let anyone else touch him.

132
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,300
Our superiors won't keep quiet once they find out about the changes in Yoshiwara.

133
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,020
Which means those guys won't get away easily.

134
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,810
I'm not very good at negotiating my way through this world.

135
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,810
Abuto, I still need you to stay alive.

136
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,140
So come up with a way to keep our superiors and let the samurai live?

137
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,500
Hey, you gotta be kidding me.

138
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,840
Why do I have to work so hard for the sake of some barbarian

139
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,100
on this remote planet who isn't one of us?

140
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,540
Because you're the one who said

141
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,660
that you would open the way to becoming the Pirate King of the universe.

142
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,700
That's different.

143
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Hey, are you listening?

144
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,360
Hey, you bonehead!

145
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,690
Kamui, you will eventually learn.

146
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,940
When you're old and look back at the path you took,

147
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,500
you'll find that our path is empty.

148
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,370
Boss, that's fine with me.

149
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,370
There isn't anything I want.

150
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,350
There isn't any reason for me to look back.

151
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,510
I only see what's ahead.

152
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,540
A new battlefield spreading before my eyes...

153
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,830
That is what I seek.

154
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,830
I strive to become stronger than any other person.

155
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,790
I move forward to become stronger than anything.

156
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,670
Even if I have nothing left to protect when I get there.

157
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,190
You've found an unbearably hot place to rest.

158
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,330
Serves you right, Hosen.

159
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,830
The prostitutes...

160
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,680
They wanted to let him sunbathe in the afterlife.

161
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,060
So? What do you want?

162
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,760
Was he a pal of yours?

163
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,520
Sorry about that.

164
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,770
No, it's just that the more annoying they are...

165
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,100
So maybe I'll be attending your funeral as well.

166

Aren't you happy?

167
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,790
No, I'll be attending yours.

168
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,610

169
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,470
No, I can top that.

170
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,640
I'll use a jet to visit you.

171
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,580
No. My jet is faster.

172
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,970
No, my jet has cheaper flights.

173

174

I didn't expect you to take down Hosen.

175

176

177

178

I had no chance on my own.

179
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,970
That's what you think,

180
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,970
but my kid apparently doesn't agree.

181
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,180
He's saying that he was the one who killed Hosen.

182
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,650
That Hosen's death was a result of the investigation into Yoshiwara.

183
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,650
Harusame shunned Hosen's excessive power.

184
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,710
The credit for the disposal of Hosen gives him total control over Yoshiwara.

185
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,010
But he didn't do anything to Yoshiwara.

186
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,430
Not only that, he didn't send any people either.

187

He's leaving it completely alone.

188
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,600
That's right.

189
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,120
He has no interest in Yoshiwara.

190
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,970
His interest...

191
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,150
is in you.

192
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,450
He obtained Yoshiwara so other people wouldn't lay a hand on you all.

193
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,640
In the end, Yoshiwara was saved, but...

194
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,500

Despite all the badmouthing she does,

199
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,520
she wishes for her brother to go back to how he used to be.

200

202

If he comes after your life in Kagura's presence,

203
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,300

204
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,600
Earthlings are an odd bunch.

They make a grave for someone they hated.

206

209
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,160
once there is hate, everything turns black.

210
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,300
Back then, I turned black.

211
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,160
And I smeared everything in him with black.

212
