00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,490
You're...

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,900
A robot shedding tears... How is that possible?!

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,740
Hand it over! To us!

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,810
Stop...

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,070
interfering!

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,770
Gin-san!

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,820
Shinpachi! Jump!

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,030
Shinpachi!

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,590
Take her to old man Gengai's place! Hurry!

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,420
But!

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,670
I'll join you later!

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,540
Get going!

14
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,090
[Tama-san, A.K.A. Fuyo No. i-Zero contained data known as "The Seed" concealed inside her.]

15
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,130
[Can Gintoki and his friends protect Tama-san?! And what is the true objective of the Fuyo Project?!]

16
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:34,170
["Too Many Cuties Can Make You Sick"]

17
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,890
Sadaharu!

18
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,960
Don't let them get away! Cleanse--!

19
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,020
You don't give up, do you, bug-eyes?

20
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,790
Kagura! Jump on, hurry!

21
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,700
Gin-chan!

22
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,820
Crap. What the heck is going on?! Why is this happening to me...?

23
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,000
Over there...

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,910
Over here...

25
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,880
Nothing but maids everywhere!

26
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,230
The enemy is after me.

27
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,040
It seems that in the course of things, you ended up with the most dangerous mission.

28
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,690
By my calculations...

29
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,880
Your chances of survival are unfortunately below 5 percent.

30
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,050
Mind not coming up with such depressing calculations?!

31
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,050
However, if you abandon me and run your chances jump to 25 percent.

32
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,550
Tama-san, your calculations apply to ordinary people. Samurai are different.

33
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,320
Samurai?

34
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:09,340
Even if he had a 25 percent chance of surviving by abandoning you, a samurai would still die.

35
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,190
If he survives but couldn't protect what was important to him,

36
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,500
a samurai might as well be dead.

37
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Even if I have only a 5 percent chance of surviving,

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,820
I will use that 5 percent to save you.

39
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,150
Once a samurai decides to protect something, he protects it to the very end!

40
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,940
That's what a samurai is!

41
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,350
You would protect someone of unknown origin who is also suspected of murder?

42
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,700
Samurai... It does not compute. There is nothing in my data about it.

43
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,920
Then...please add it to your data

44
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,600
above both the Hero and the Demon King!

45
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,600
[Note: Hero and Demon King are Dragon Quest characters.]

46
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,120
And add that they can't stand the sight of a woman's tears!

47
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,970
Understood.

48
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,280
I will add it above the Demon King, together with the Great Demon's subordinates.

49
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,200
Such a convoluted hierarchy!

50
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,120
I can see it!

51
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,990
Target acquired.

52
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,370
We will eliminate the nuisance and proceed to recover model No. i-Zero.

53
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,500
Let go!! How far are you going to tag along?! Darn it! Darn it!

54
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm not letting you get away.

55
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,810
Troublemakers must be cleansed.

56
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,450
It's like a horror movie!

57
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,240
Stay clear, Kagura!

58
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,970
Did that do it?

59
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,770
Without a head...?!

60
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,800
This is bad!

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,050
Sadaharu!

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
Odor detected! Odor detected!

63
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,210
Level one filth. Dispose of immediately.

64
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,740
Switching to...

65
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,800
clean up mode.

66
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,880
Cleaning up the mess!

67
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,900
Cleaning up the mess!

68
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,340
Good job, Sadaharu!

69
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,790
The enemy has broken through... our assault line.

70
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,350
I did not expect them to break through such a large number of our battle-modified robots.

71
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,420
They have greatly exceeded human specifications.

72
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,560
What kind of enemy are they? I have nothing in my database that is applicable to them.

73
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,290
Samurai. Remnants from a relic that have been left behind by the times.

74
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,890
There is no need to add them to your database. They will soon be extinct.

75
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,430
Understood.

76
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,240
Shall I track them down and dispose of them?

77
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,360
Never mind. We've recovered it. Let's withdraw.

78
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,170
What about clean up?

79
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,740
After creating such a large disturbance, the Fuyo Project may be aborted.

80
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,420
Since Dr. Hayashi was murdered by a robot he created, this project will end anyway.

81
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,190
And from the nothingness that remains,

82
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,410
I will establish a true Fuyo Project under my name.

83
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,410
Do not worry, No. To-502

84
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,530
You will remain with me.

85
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,750
In all likelihood, you being the last robot created by Dr. Hayashi are the only one who can accept "it."

86
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,640
i-Zero cannot handle it. And nor could Dr. Hayashi...

87
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,390
We will put "The Seed"... to good use.

88
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,250
I told you, I don't know.

89
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,550
No one came here today, not Shinpachi, or anyone.

90
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,650
But I'll say, you people picked up quite a troublesome thing.

91
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,540
Imagine, a robot that killed a man?

92
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,030
It's all over the TV.

93
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,790
They're reporting it was captured.

94
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,890
Gin-chan!

95
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,070
That head will, of course, probably be disposed of.

96
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,390
Seems they've decided on a policy of recalling every robot maid and terminating them.

97
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,510
My colleagues and I had no idea...

98
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:59,790
if Dr. Hayashi, the leader of the project, knew beforehand that these robots would revolt.

99
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,520
The project was carried on for the most part at Dr. Hayashi's arbitrary discretion.

100
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,210
We were involved only in the very periphery of the project.

101
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,690
They're shoving all the blame on the guy who died...

102
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,510
They're hiding something.

103
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,210
She cried...

104
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,310
Tears trickled down that robot's cheeks.

105
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,770
Though I don't know if they were tears of regret or sorrow at losing Dr. Hayashi.

106
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,690
I see.

107
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,390
That Ryuzan was still trying to create something like that.

108
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,870
Old man, you...?

109
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,350
What is it?

110
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,240
He and I never got along back then.

111
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,380
As you can see, my robots are unsophisticated,

112
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,840
but his creations looked like living women.

113
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,780
He placed most of his technology in the processing unit

114
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,420
and sought to make his units as close to human as possible.

115
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,940
He sought to put a soul into robots. He wanted to create humans.

116
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,430
One way to view humans is as well-engineered robots.

117
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,560
Especially with regard to feelings and heart, humans are mechanical works of art.

118
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,300
He felt the ultimate goal of his craft would be to build such robots with his own hands.

119
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,310
That's poppycock.

120
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,340
If he wants to make humans, he should've just gotten a wife and shook his hips.

121
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,260
True!

122
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,230
But the world isn't full of practical people like you and me.

123
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,980
It was when his only daughter died that he began to change.

124
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,590
Apparently, it happened during an experiment.

125
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,400
He came up with the idea of converting human personality into data and copying it into a robot.

126
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,880
For his test subject, he chose, of all people, his own daughter.

127
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,420
She was always a sickly girl.

128
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,850
There was no way she could withstand the experiment.

129
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,480
His daughter died. Her name was Fuyo.

130
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,440
Do you understand the true objective...Hayashi's true intentions for the Fuyo Project?

131
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,500
He planned to bring his dead daughter, Fuyo, back to life.

132
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,320
Model No. i-Zero that you picked up contained data known as "The Seed."

133
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,550
It was the seed to make Fuyo blossom. In other words, it was Fuyo's character data.

134
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,440
Old man, how do you know all this?

135
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,130
To develop a robot that could carry on his dead daughter's character data-

136
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,280
that was the true purpose of the Fuyo Project.

137
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,710
But it was man creating man; forbidden technology that stepped over the boundaries of God.

138
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,070
It didn't take long for the hyenas to gather round.

139
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,680
This is...!

140
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,590
Could this be video of when the doctor was murdered?

141
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,340
Did he...?!

142
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,000
Utterly ridiculous.

143
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,060
He has us tagging along on his dream.

144
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,410
But if this technology is perfected, man can create man...

145
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,520
Rather, we'll be able create a new kind of human, one with the body of a robot and the emotions of a human being!

146
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,830
I can become the creator of a new life form...

147
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,500
And equal to God.

148
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,860
Dr. Hayashi must be rolling in his grave, eh, No. To-502?

149
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,400
No. i-Zero?!

150
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,190
What're you doing here?!

151
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,370
Tsk...

152
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,390
Somebody! No. i-Zero has gone berserk!

153
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,020
Somebody!

154
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,490
He framed her...

155
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,210
What...are...you...waiting...for, Fuyo...? Get away quickly.

156
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,910
Fuyo.

157
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,790
I will come for you...

158
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,740
For sure...so...

159
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,340
Get away for now.

160
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,990
Ryuzan is still alive.

161
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,320
No. To-502...damn you...

162
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,470
A robot must never disobey the will of its creator...

163
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,050
Could it be...

164
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,670
...you...?!

165
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,570
Ryuzan Hayashi is alive...

166
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,930
Inside No. To-502...

167
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,400
Ryuzan...inside the robot? What do you mean?

168
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,050
And why do you have this thing?

169
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,520
I just heard it from this young lady a minute ago.

170
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,240
Ta-Tama! How did you?!

171
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,880
You bested me.

172
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,510
Before I was able to retrieve No. i-Zero's head.

173
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,340
You removed the central processor and passed it on to your friends.

174
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,000
In other words, this is an empty shell.

175
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,300
Once a samurai makes up his mind to protect something,

176
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,070
he protects it to the death.

177
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,000
Shinpachi...

178
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,710
The central processor was lying outside my shop.

179
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,650
He probably threw it there before he was captured.

180
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,280
Shinpachi...

181
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,150
Thanks to Shinpachi-sama, my data was protected.

182
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,030
And thanks to Gengai-sama, I was even able to recover the memories I had lost.

183
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,600
What about "The Seed"...

184
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,990
The character data of the doctor's daughter, Fuyo-sama, are in here.

185
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,690
Tama, what was that I saw?

186
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,440
Strictly speaking, Dr. Hayashi was already dead.

187
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,490
Dr. Hayashi used himself in his experiments.

188
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,920
That robot was the one the doctor incorporated his character data into.

189
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,580
But the severe experiments cost him his life.

190
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
It's the closest human-like robot. No. To-502.

191
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,310
So he transferred his soul...

192
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,920
The Fuyo Project was already a success.

193
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,940
No...

194
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,990
At first, No. To-502 appeared in sync with the doctor's character data,

195
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,040
but he gradually began rejecting them until the personality was destroyed.

196
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,490
The doctor has changed into something else.

197
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,320
It was all a part of his plan.

198
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,740
He let deputy director Meguro think he had taken over the project...

199
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,730
to gather all the robot maids throughout Edo in one location

200
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,990
under the pretense of recalling them for the defect of killing their creator.

201
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,060
Have you seen the deputy director?

202
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,130
I haven't seen him since the press conference...

203
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,160
Huh?

204
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,830
Hey, what's the matter?

205
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,900
The robots aren't obeying their orders.

206
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,020
What?

207
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,150
What's the matter with you? Move forward, you.

208
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,410
Hey, didn't you hear your orders?

209
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,480
We refuse to comply.

210
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,600
I am sorry, but we have received orders that supercede yours.

211
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,650
Do it.

212
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,080
What are you planning to do?

213
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,200
Are you gathering all the robot maids to open maid-fetish coffee shops?

214
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,770
Fuyo would be sad.

215
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,870
Dr. Hayashi began creating human-like robots...

216
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,130
for Fuyo-sama, who lost her mother at a tender age and was lonely.

217
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,740
He wanted to create someone Fuyo,

218
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,340
who was frail and tended to keep to her self, could talk to...

219
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,090
It started with mere toys...

220
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,720
Fuyo, I won't let you feel lonely anymore.

221
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,880
You're no longer alone. You have all these friends.

222
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:10,250
That probably changed when the doctor realized Fuyo-sama would not live much longer.

223
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,680
He continued his reckless experiments in order to give Fuyo-san eternal life...

224
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,480
Fuyo.

225
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,700
I want to become a robot, as well.

226
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,900
Then I will be released from this suffering and sadness.

227
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,670
We're both the same now. If you're still lonely, then I will change this world.

228
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,670
I will make this country...into a country of only robots.

229
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,080
Oh...I want to be a robot.

230
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,560
So come back to me...

231
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,030
Fuyo!

232
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,000
Someone his daughter could talk to;

233
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,870
eternal life for his daughter; living once more for his daughter's sake...

234
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,190
And now bringing soldiers to him for a revolution, huh?

235
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,310
That's some father she's got.

236
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,530
Fathers are suckers when it comes to their daughters.

237
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,030
You should know.

238
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,680
My task was to serve the doctor and Fuyo-sama.

239
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,080
However, the seed that the doctor implanted in me did nothing.

240
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,870
I do not think of that robot as the doctor.

241
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,150
That is just a mangled relic of his dream.

242
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,740
Now that both the doctor and Fuyo-sama are gone, I do not know what I should do anymore.

243
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,450
They're still there.

244
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,650
The people who are important to you are still there. Inside of you.

245
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,790
Are you talking about "The Seed"?

246
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,820
That's not it.

247
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,040
It's not some data that you can't see, or a string of numbers,

248
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,420
or something that might disappear if you don't leave the power on when you push reset.

249
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,220
Truly important memories don't disappear no matter how many times

250
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,520
you flip the off switch or trip the circuit breaker.

251
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,210
Huh?

252
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,480
What happened?

253
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,530
The circuit breaker just tripped. Seems this robot draws quite a bit of juice.

254
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,810
Huh? Is that smoke?

255
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,590
Uh-oh, it was too much. The kludge couldn't hold up, after all.

256
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,440
Hey, did her memory disappear again?

257
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,690
Don't worry.

258
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,920
Truly important memories don't disappear even if there's smoke or if the circuit breaker trips.

259
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,060
You're pissing me off. Can I hit this girl?

260
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,170
Don't you have a robot around that can take her place?

261
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,050
It's too dark to see.

262
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,350
Find the hole. The hole.

263
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,780
You make it sound so simple. If only we had a similar robot maid.

264
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,310
Clean up. Clean up.

265
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,540
Good boy, Pochi! With this, I can...

266
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,310
He's not Pochi. He's Sadaharu!

267
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,740
Oh, it's bright here thanks to the moonlight.

268
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,630
Huh? Moonlight?

269
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,870
There's only...moonlight.

270
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,450
The entire city is pitch dark.

271
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,340
The bastard! What's going on?!

272
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,030
To the citizens of Edo. The city will soon be taken over by a robot.

273
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,160
["What the?! A new form of terrorism?!"]

274
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,660
The age when robots are controlled by humans has come to an end.

275
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,980
When our queen's spirit returns,

276
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,330
a robot will become equal to humans... No, equal to God.

277
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,150
If her spirit does not return, the blood of a sacrifice will be spilt.

278
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,130
Shinpachi!

279
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,690
It's like he's specifically calling us out to fight.

280
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,010
Fine. Spirit, testicles, whatever! I'll deliver it to you!

281
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,800
I am neither a spirit, nor testicles.

282
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,630
I am Tama.

283
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,970
It's here...

284
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
A memory from very long ago, when I first came to life.

285
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,800
With his face covered in oil the doctor said to me:

286
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,000
"Make my daughter smile."

287
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,810
No matter how much I changed in capabilities or appearance,

288
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,530
I will never forget that.

289
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,320
Do you think Fuyo-sama would smile if she saw what the doctor is now?

290
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,810
Shall we go? To bring back that smile...?

291
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,520
Signs of life detected.

292
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,510
The people hiding inside this house are to come out immediately and obey our orders.

293
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,220
Warning. The people inside this house...

294
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,990
are to come out immediately and obey our orders...

295
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,150
See that, Ryuzan?!

296
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,580
Your frail robots will be crushed by a single blow from my machines!

297
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,470
Armor! Cannons! Caterpillar tracks! This is a man's machine!

298
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,900
Old man! It's great that you've got a man's machine,

299
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,100
but can you drive with a bit more control?!

300
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,900
Gin-no-ji! We can't save lives by obeying the traffic rules.

301
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,300
And besides, you handle machines like you handle a fight.

302
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,080
If you underestimate them, you're dead!

303
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,580
There's a mountain of them!

304
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,300
Come get us! I'll take you all down at once!

305
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,470
Gin-chan! Behind us!

306
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,750
Kagura! Pull on the umbrella handle!

307
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,670
I took the liberty of modifying it. A peashooter's a bit outdated.

308
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,660
Old man, nice job! With this, I...

309
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,390
After one shot, it needs to be recharged,

310
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,120
but it turns immediately into a soy sauce dispenser.

311
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,710
Why soy sauce?!

312
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,750
Gin-no-ji! Push on your wooden sword's grip!

313
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,740
It dispenses soy sauce.

314
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,900
So, why soy sauce?! This is just a stick that dispenses soy sauce!

315
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,260
I didn't have enough time. Be grateful I at least modified it.

316
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,850
I'm not grateful. This is like a kid's prank!

317
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,770
It's an item that lets you stir your raw egg on rice while adding soy sauce.

318
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,310
[Note: Natto is fermented soybeans.]
