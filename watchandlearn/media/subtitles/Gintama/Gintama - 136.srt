00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,280
Our apologies to all our viewers today.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,020
Gin, what are we apologizing for?

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,180
Well, something unexpected happened.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,250
Remember last year when we had to skip one episode because of the Japan World Series?

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,550
It really messed up our schedules. All of a sudden, we had to adjust the number of stories.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,650
So this year, we did something different.

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,170
Don't tell me...

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,970
Yes, we're one story short.

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,390
Then we didn't have the Japan World Series this year.

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,350
So we're short one story.

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,180
Therefore, we don't have an on-air episode for you today.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,850
What?! What are we going to do tonight then?

14
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,390
Anyway, what did you mean by unexpected?!

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,900
Hey, staff! Why couldn't you figure this out?

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,360
Don't worry. They're writing today's script in the back room right now.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,880
They said we have to ad lib until then.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,870
When did you put in the order? How much longer will it take them to finish?

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,880
Well, they need about another 29 minutes.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,890
The show will be over by then!

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,720
On the last recap show, the executives complained to our producer:

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,480
"Using stills over a long period causes our sales in foreign countries to drop.

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,090
It's hard for foreigners to understand unless the picture is animated."

24
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,260
Are you kidding? Even Japanese have a hard time understanding the original gags in this anime.

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,970
It's too late to do something for foreign countries!

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,640
Th-That's true.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,560
That makes a lot of sense.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,550
Forget about foreign sales.

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,650
It sounds like too much. We should just focus on the immediate broadcast.

30
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,910
Well, that's why I'm concerned about today's show.

31
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,220
It would make no sense to show still pictures with background music for an entire show.

32
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,220
It's not good for foreign countries or Japan.

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,810
Oh give it up, will you?

34
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,870
Are you supposed to be a spy for someone, Shinpachi? TV Tokyo? Or Dentsu?

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,430
Dah! Don't be so specific!

36
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,870
I understand what the executives meant.

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,590
In any case, all we have to do is animate the picture, right?

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,280
Then foreign sales won't suffer and the executives will be happy.

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
Everyone understands this is Japanese anime, right?

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,150
Probably.

41
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,500
All right. Let's get motivated and move the picture around.

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,460
Here we go!

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,450
Ohhh!

44
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,360
Eh...

45
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,640
You're saying work is not all right, but you're doing fine.

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,970
Yeah, kind of.

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,970
I have some savings from my last job, so don't worry about me. I'm all right.

48
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,530
Are you sure? Call me if you have any problems. Are you really all right?

49
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,370
Y-Yeah, sure. I live in a fairly decent apartment.

50
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,270
Yeah, it's really stylish.

51
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,290
Really? Then why don't I visit soon and clean up your place?

52
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,930
No! I don't need you to clean up!

53
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,840
I'm sure your room is full of trash, right?

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,050
I said no! I don't want to bother you.

55
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,390
What? Is there something you don't want me to see?

56
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,300
I-It's not like that! I keep my room clean! Really!

57
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,350
Then I'm looking forward to it.

58
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,950
I'll see you this weekend.

59
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,060
Ah, wait!

60
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,560
Hey, I'm jealous!

61
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,060
She said, "Can I come to clean your place?" You got yourself quite a little wife there.

62
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,850
I guess it's about time for you to start over with her.

63
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,640
Why aren't you living together?

64
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,650
I mean, go live in that wonderful house.

65
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:55,390
["It's Your House, You Build It"]

66
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,230
Hello, we'd like to talk to you. Hasegawa, you're there, aren't you?

67
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,120
Hasegawa!

68
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,810
[Please don't look for me. Hasegawa.]

69
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,860
He already ran off.

70
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,620
Debt collectors were pounding on my door, and I skipped out.

71
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,550
That was two weeks ago.

72
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,800
I was all right the first night.

73
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,850
I thought I could find a new place easily.

74
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,870
But...I couldn't find a room for rent anywhere.

75
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Right, I didn't pay my debts or rent. I kept doing those kinds of things.

76
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,440
So my name wound up on the real estate black list. Those guys don't mess around.

77
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,180
Nobody will lend me money anymore.

78
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,640
No real estate company will rent me an apartment.

79
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,690
There's no place for me to go here in Kabukicho.

80
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,020
I thought I'd be homeless for just one day.

81
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,140
But...

82
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Now I'm like... like this.

83
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,310
But I think you're looking better than ever.

84
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,430
Dog...

85
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,140
radio...

86
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,350
cardboard box.

87
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,980
You're completely covered by the Three Sacred Treasures of the homeless.

88
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,470
You've finally found your lifetime job.

89
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,230
I don't have a lifetime job. I have no job.

90
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:31,150
You can change your job in FF3, but the first job, Onion Knight, is the strongest.

91
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,350
It's always the same.

92
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,370
Are you trying to cheer me up? Or do you want me to kick you around?

93
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,970
How could you say I'm like Onion Knight?

94
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,470
You smell like a rotten onion.

95
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,390
That was a critical hit.

96
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,740
No!

97
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,310
I need a place to stay so I can restore my hit points!

98
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,600
I can't restore my hit points in a cardboard box!

99
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,600
What should I do?

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,040
If Hatsu sees me like this, we'll never reconcile our differences. And she'll leave me.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,590
I'd say you have no one to blame but yourself.

102
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,380
I have to do something by this weekend!

103
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,310
I need to find a stylish place, even if it's just for the weekend!

104
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,880
Can you help me, Gin?

105
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,720
I'm sure your name is already on the black list, maybe even in the Death Note.

106
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,810
Oh, yeah. I'll put your name in my Death Note, then.

107
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,440
See ya.

108
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,010
Hey, wait! Wait!

109
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,760
[Real Estate]

110
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,340
Taizo Hasegawa: 38 years old.

111
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,250
Occupation: Onion Knight.

112
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,460
Um, excuse me, but I have to ask... What is it you do as an Onion Knight?

113
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,850
I just can't remember.

114
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,770
I think I met someone once a long time ago who said he was an Onion Knight.

115
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,230
Um... Well...

116
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,260
It's a job that involves fermenting onions.

117
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,620
I see. It's kind of like making wine and doing this and doing that, right?

118
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,050
Oh, yes. Something like that.

119
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,190
Oh, I know. I saw that on TV. I think it was on that show Professionals.

120
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,190
What?

121
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,520
No, it wasn't on Professional.

122
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,090
That was Music something or other.

123
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,100
Music?

124
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,510
Oh? Does it look like I'm lying?

125
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,100
You think I'm lying? I really know what it is.

126
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,570
No! I believe you!

127
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,510
No, you don't. I noticed some momentary bad feelings between us.

128
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,770
Shoot, if my wife were still alive, she could prove it for me.

129
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,500
She passed away one year ago. Darn it.

130
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,470
Well, I think I've already heard enough about it.

131
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,960
Hey, old man! The laundry detergent is running out.

132
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,400
Can you get some real quick?

133
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,510
I'm working right now! I'm going to kill you, old hag!

134
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,180
Shut up and die, stupid, old man!

135
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,590
Well, I'll show you some properties. Let's go.

136
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,470
Oh, yes.

137
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,980
Hey, he's going to show me some properties just like that.

138
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,040
Doesn't he have a black list?

139
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,740
Anyway, the old guy seems a little nutty. Who is he?

140
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,760
They call him...

141
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,410
...the Messiah of Kabukicho. His name is Sanzo Fudo.

142
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,760
Um...this isn't it, and so this is... Oh, well.

143
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,370
There're a lot of bums like you in town.

144
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,480
Some are chased, and some have a guilty conscience.

145
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,120
They're all in an abyss of misery.

146
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,310
There's a real estate agent who gives them a helping hand and a place to stay.

147
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,250
Fudo is the kind of person who would offer people a place to stay,

148
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,700
no matter who they were, just like a Messiah.

149
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,210
Those who are alive.

150
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,930
Excuse me, but can you tell me where this property is?

151
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,270
Well, I think he's just not being choosy enough for his clients, right?

152
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,970
That old man seems careless.

153
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,080
I'm glad that he'll show us some properties, but I'm a little anxious as well.

154
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,540
Hasegawa.

155
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,710
Do you have any specific requests for a place?

156
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,190
Well, yeah... First, the cheapest is the best.

157
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,430
And it's better if it's fancy.

158
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,500
Don't expect much.

159
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,060
Don't forget about your situation right now, Onion Knight.

160
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,380
It's enough that there's a roof over your head when it rains.

161
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,470
But Hatsu is coming.

162

[1LDK: 1 bedroom, 1 Living room, and 1 Dining Kitchen]

163
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,870
Let's try something cheap, a 1LDK.

164
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,950
1LDK?

165
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,720
Yeah, it's enough for a single man.

166
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:29,600
R-Right. I think a single man needs...1WGTM.

167
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,980
Huh? What did you just say?

168
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,860
O-One...3P would be perfect!

169
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,280
No, we're not talking about a 3P!

170
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,370
I know that. But I'm getting old, so it's hard to speak in loan words.

171
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,850
Don't worry, I understand your request and I'll take you.

172
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,060
Well, I guess this should satisfy you.

173
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,510
[犬(One)LDK [Dog 犬 pronounced "one" in Japanese]

174
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,510
That's not a 1LDK!

175
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,200
Why do I have to live in such a filthy dog house?!

176
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,250
Don't you really know what 1LDK means?

177
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,500
Of course, I know.

178
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,480
I just thought that was a good doghouse for Hasegawa's dirty mutt.

179
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,220
That's none of your business!

180
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,550
Come on, don't get me wrong.

181
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,570
There's no way that a real estate agent doesn't know what 1LDK means.

182
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,480
That's a common term. We use it a lot.

183
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,580
Why don't you use it then?

184
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,270
Let's see... We'll use it after we come back from our trip.

185
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,670
Man, 1LDK is the best!

186
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,800
No way! We'll just say, "My home is the best."

187
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,280
Why do you bother replacing it with a complicated word like "1LDK"?

188
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,540
I'm sorry. To tell you the truth, my 1LDK went back to her parents' house.

189
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,210
What are you talking about, 1LDK went back to her parents' house?"

190
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,850
A 1LDK is a place, not a person!

191
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,440
Um...Can you show us some other properties?

192
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,710
He doesn't care about a 1LDK anyway, only rent. Cheaper is better.

193
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,160
Is that right? I'm not sure if 1LDK will come back.

194
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,970
Is that all right with you?

195
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,470
What kind of 1LDK are you talking about?!

196
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,510
How about this property?

197
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,350
It looks good to me.

198
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,570
I'd prefer something more stylish.

199
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,660
I knew you were going to say that. Don't worry.

200
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,970
This isn't the one I wanted to show you.

201
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,510
This one.

202
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,470
Another doghouse?!

203
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,590
No, this is completely different from the last one. This one is more stylish.

204
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,180
Look!

205
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,550
It has can badges!

206
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,370
No thanks! I don't need those kinds of accessories!

207
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,140
Anyway, why are can badges on a doghouse?

208
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,140
What? I bet you don't know what a 1LDK is, do you?

209
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,670
That's not right...I said 1LDK is not here.

210
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,260
Stop it! I can't live in that kind of place!

211
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,100
That's not even a house for people! Show me a place for people!

212
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,500
I see. That's what you wanted. Now I know.

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,270
Why didn't you tell me that in the beginning?

214
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,060
I'm confident in myself with this place.

215
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,520
What kind of confidence are you talking about?!

216
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,280
That's enough! This is just a doghouse!

217
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,390
It's not even close to a 1LDK. Did you hear what I said?

218
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,890
Yes, I did. Look over there!

219
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,170
See. A person lives there.

220
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,760
That's not the point!

221
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,200
That's not right! I'm a useless, old man.

222
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,080
And I'm a bit of a masochist, but I didn't come here today to play!

223
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,380
I'm just looking for a place to live! I can't live in this kind of place!

224
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,380
Why are you getting shy? I'm not your master!

225
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,040
No one's trying to turn you on!

226
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,810
Well, do you have anything a bit better?

227
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,250
All right. In fact, I've got the perfect place for an Onion Knight like you.

228
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,640
Are you sure this time?

229
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,010
Almost.

230
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,390
Aren't you going to point it out?

231
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,600
Well, there's some truth in what you meant. I admit it.

232
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
Gin, please don't!

233
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,260
I know Hasegawa isn't really an Onion Knight, but a Dark Knight.

234
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,000
His job is more like a cockroach knight.

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,890
I said I didn't have a job.

236
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,770
And we'll stop being choosy, so please show us a normal and cheap property.

237
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,330
All right. Then let me show you a good one. How about that one?

238
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,330
What?

239
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,860
Are you listening to us?!

240
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,260
This is one of the best apartments among my high-end properties.

241
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,340
I said, "Are you listening to me?"

242
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,370
This one is always popular and occupied.

243
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,660
But it just now became available. You're really lucky!

244
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,490
And the monthly fee is only three million yen. This is a really rare opportunity.

245
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,450
I don't need it, but give me a chance to throw some poop on your face instead.

246
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,530
All right. How about 30,000 yen with a discount instead?

247
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,440
Wh-What?

248
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,190
They both have "3", so 30,000 yen is a deal.

249
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,640
What kind of random reason do you have for that kind of discount? It's a 99% discount!

250
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,810
What? Are you angry? Or maybe you've snapped? Or you're desperate?

251
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,310
Actually, the last tenant suddenly left because of his job.

252
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,130
So, the household effects are still there. And the place wasn't cleaned up.

253
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,020
If you'll dispose or take care of those things, I'll give you the discounted price of 30,000 yen for rent.

254
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,170
Really? Are you sure? That's all I have to do to live here?

255
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,770
No problem! We'll take care of it!

256
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,410
We'll use all the household effects. It's a great benefit to us!

257
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm sure Hatsu will be happy.

258
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,790
That's good.

259
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,010
[NOBORU]

260
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,810
Well, it's a little bit dirty, as I said. Good luck.

261
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,560
For what?!

262
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,970
Whoa! This...is...

263
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,030
O-Obviously...this was the scene of a murder!

264
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,560
By "disposal," does he mean dispose of everything at the murder site?!

265
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,560
And "take care"? Does he mean getting involved in a murder?

266
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,050
Oh, this is a great view. I bet the view at night is wonderful.

267
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,920
Why are you so blasé? Look at the mess we're in!

268
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,080
What are you so excited about? Can you tell me where the murder took place?

269
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,980
The blood is all over the place!

270
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,720
I wouldn't be surprised if that kid from Case Closed barged in right about now!

271
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,120
Eh? Is this blood? I thought this was a custom-painted wall.

272
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,340
It can't be! It's so disgusting!

273
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,650
Hasegawa, please calm down.

274
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,430
You said this was a crime scene? Something like that happens only in a TV drama.

275
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,200
I think this place was probably used for gutting a tuna or something.

276
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,060
That sounds even less likely! Why did a tuna have to be gutted here?

277
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,960
Moreover, why did the tuna write a dying message?

278
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,730
What? This is not a dying message.

279
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,640
So somebody's practicing their calligraphy?

280
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,600
It splattered around the room after it worked hard to write NOBORU.

281
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,750
That's pretty painstaking work!

282
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,030
Anyway, don't worry about it.

283
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,000
About what?

284
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,370
Even if they were murdered, it's no big deal.

285
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,990
Yes, it is! You sound like this is someone else's problem.

286
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,010
I can't live in a place where there was a murder.

287
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,370
It doesn't matter what happened in the past. Now is more important.

288
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,010
True. There's blood everywhere now... that's what I'm really concerned about.

289
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,490
Hasegawa, rooms and women are the same.

290
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,450
Listen to me.

291
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,410
Most pretty girls have already been "done" by some stupid guy at their middle school

292
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,930
or high school before we ever meet them.

293
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,510
What are you talking about?!

294
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,930
Let's say there's a girl who was unpolished and innocent when she entered school,

295
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:32,450
but after summer vacation, she's got dyed hair and ear piercings.

296
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,970
Again, what are you talking about?!

297
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,050
I'm positive about it. During summer vacation, she met some loser.

298
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,980
In summer, she had so much fun that she was taken advantage of.

299
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,180
Hey! I really don't understand what you're trying to tell me!

300
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,200
But even so, would you ask her about it?

301
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,240
You wouldn't, right?

302
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,250
You would just keep it in your mind.

303
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,350
You'd like to ask her, "What happened to you during summer?"

304
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,040
No, you wouldn't. Because you know she'll hate you if you ask.

305
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,650
It'd be a turn-off for her.

306
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,840
That's right. When we meet women, we already know those kinds of things.

307
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,160
And it's the same for rooms.

308
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,860
In general, a good room has been "done" already!

309
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,100
What do you mean that the room has been "done?"

310
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,550
And if you have to inquire about the history of every room you find,

311
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,060
you shouldn't bother!

312
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,090
Good grief.

313
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,030
I've been working in the real estate business for over 50 years and I never...

314
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,190
I never thought that I would meet someone who really cared about a room.

315
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,970
Why are you crying? Did any part of that story make you cry?

316
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,700
He's exactly right. The nice rooms are all tainted.

317
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,830
Most likely a murder happened there.

318
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,970
You liar! I have never heard anything like that!

319
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,990
I think it's something like the magic of the room.

320
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,930
The room is not just for a space to live in, but also a place to catch a person's soul.

321
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,070
As a matter of fact, this is a problem room.

322
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,470
Seven people have already died in here.

323
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,320
What?!

324
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't know what the cause was,

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,080
but the people who lived here started attacking each other all of a sudden,

326
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,890
and died soon after.

327
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,160
Hey, you! Why did you show me such a bad place?!

328
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,130
In fact, you were even trying to charge me rent!

329
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,730
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it.

330
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,350
I just felt sorry for this room. Everybody thinks it's cursed.

331
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,610
The room works out well when occupied.

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,870
Even if it's a great room, it's just like a hole unless someone lives there.

333
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,110
I know some people call me a Messiah because I save all kinds of people.

334
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,160
But I don't deserve it.

335
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:47,460
I just wanted to turn all these dumps into real rooms.

336
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm so glad that you'll become a real room soon.

337
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,790
Here it is.

338
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:01,040
I want to give this to you. You can use this room however you want.

339
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,350
It's totally up to you how you use this room.

340
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,120
I hope you'll...

341
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,040
I don't think I deserve this offer.

342
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,260
I think this room will be happy when a person who needs a place lives here.

343
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,060
Well, I think a man who takes good care of the room should live here.

344
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,470
It'll make the room happy.

345
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,970
I want you to take this.

346
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,310
I already heard that.

347
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,460
It's not nice to hand it to me and say, "I already heard that"?

348
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,560
Sir...

349
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,560
This is the third time.

350
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
No!

351
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,070
Enough! I told you I wanted to give it to you. Just take it already!

352
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,230
Who wants such a creepy room?!

353
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,700
You can't get rid of it by giving it to someone who's a nuisance! It's not fair!

354
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,900
But you're talking about something totally different.

355
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,950
Just take it. You said, "It doesn't matter what happened in the past." Didn't you?!

356
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,640
Right from the start, it was your fault because you don't have a job!

357
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,420
So, accept the responsibility and just die here!

358
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,600
Take it!

359
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,680
No!

360
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,010
I don't want it, either!

361
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,010
Just take it

362
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,190
Ki...Kill...

363
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,130
Kill...Kill...

364
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,140
Kill...Kill...

[A couple of days later]

366
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,210
Oh, my! This is a really great apartment.

367
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,540
I wonder how he got the money to afford this kind of place?

368
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,550
He didn't do anything fancy, like sending an invitation without a return address...

369
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,500
Um, oh, here it is.

370
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,420
Hello! I came to clean up.

371
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,600
Ki...Kill...

372
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,200

[NOBORU]

374
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,180
[Preview]

375
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,170
People say that your heart grows fonder when you don't see your sweetheart for a long time.

376
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,270
I just noticed that he left me for three months.

377
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,680
Although the show is in its third year, I've only been in three episodes.

378
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,390
I'm in the preview right now, or is it only my imagination?

379
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,970
Tune in next time for

380
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,180
"99 Percent of Men Aren't Confident in Confessing Their Love"

381
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,720
[And also: "People Who Don't Believe In Santa Are The Very Ones Who Want To Believe, You Contentious Bastard"]
