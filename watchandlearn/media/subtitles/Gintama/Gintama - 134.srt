Is she taking the Stand into her own body?

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,350
But you're just His Excellency!

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,600
I'll turn you into a wax dummy, too!

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,250
D-Don't underestimate me, you old hag!

6
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,880
It's providence that a dead person goes to the next world.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,890
Yes, that's right! But not everyone can go to heaven.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,550
Some people can't go there!

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,370
This is the only place for people like them!

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,180
You... You have no right to take it from them!

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,200
What keeps them here is not their failure to go to heaven.

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,350
Okami, it's because of you!

13
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,970
No way!

14
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,990
It can't be.

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,680
This is... This is...

16
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,430

[Be Very Careful When Using Ghost Stories]

20
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,350
You dirty, old hag!

21
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,160
I'll make sugar candy out of you, too!

22
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,810
His Excellency?! Impossible... he can transform into His Excellency and yet still be himself?!

23
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,000
Wait! More importantly, who...

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,150
did he possess himself with? Rei!

25
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,250
Damn!

26
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,460
This is the spell prison I trapped Rei inside of!

27
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,940
Okami.

28
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,260
Danna... How long has it been like this?

29
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,520
Us... this inn... when we started

30
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,430
it was a much more wonderful place.

31
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,160
Do you want to come with me? I'm sure you don't have any relatives to go to.

32
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:08,220
Listen, this inn is for ghosts who failed to get to heaven.

33
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,460
They couldn't make it to paradise,

34
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,970
but we can at least give them a bath here and help them get to heaven.

35
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,990
So many souls have been able to go to heaven from here.

36
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,670
This place was like a terminal for lost and weary souls who had no other place to go.

37
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,610
However, after that day,

38
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,690
the inn now lies in ruins filled with Stands.

39
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,500
Okami and Danna, both of you knew about this, didn't you?

40
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:51,600
Stop blathering, little girl. The Stands are our business partners. That's all!

41
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,500
Gin.

42
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,680
All right.

43
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,100
The time has come to break these cursed chains that have tied down the sprits here for so long.

44
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,100
Gin, please free them all.

45

47
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,500
Don't think you can push your luck just because you have become His Excellency!

48
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,920
You think you can beat my husband just by possessing a small fry like Rei?!

49
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,390
Such a weak vessel. I'll smash it!

Did he switch to another Stand?! Has this guy got multiple Stands?!

57
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,130
What amazing power!

58
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,060
It took ten years even for me to handle a couple of Stands at the same time!

59
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,450

I don't remember inhaling anyone like this!

No, it's not just the Stands at the inn.

That's...

Tagosaku sucking in all the Stands from every living thing in the village!

122

He's sucking in all of the Stands?! That means... death.

Dear, what are you talking about?

130
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,750
Are you going to take the Stands of all the living creatures in this village?!

131
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,070
If you do that,

132
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,450
the bodies will rot, and everything in this village will die.

133

Stop it! Can't you hear me?!

Tagosaku!

135
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,040
It's no good! He won't even listen to Okami.

136
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,060
The Stand has gone out of control!

137
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,910
Keeping so many Stands in one place for a long time

138
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,310
will increase the negative emotions

139
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,850
and the power of the Stands will have an even bigger influence on this world.

140
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,550
To the point where they can't be controlled by human power.

141
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,350
This place will no longer be a province of nature, but a living hell.

142
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,040
The negative emotions will continue increasing

143
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,770
and the entire world will erode if we don't bring this under control.

144
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,460
No! You can't be doing such a thing!

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,060
Escape into my body for now!

Just a little...

155
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,430
Even Gin's Stand came out!

156
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,080
What the hell are you doing, you wavy-haired jerk!

157
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,880
His suction is unbelievable! Every household should have at least one.

158
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,740
Everyone has become Stands!

159
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,810
Hurry! Return to my body.

160
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,190
What the hell?! That weirdo just made off with your body!

161
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,670
Xavier, wait! That's my body!

162
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,350
Hey, give it back, baldy! Oh crap! My body has been stolen!

163
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,260
This way!

164
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,060
Enter my body! Take my hand!

165
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,310
Hurry!

166
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,060
No way!

167
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,150
You old bat, where do you think you're showing your hand from!

168
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,260
I would rather lose my soul than go in there!

169
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,820
Fine, already. Then how about the front?

170
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,510
You're dead, you old bat! Seriously!

171
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,560
Oiwa, everyone will become one.

172
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,560
Everyone will throw away their bodies and become one.

173
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,950
Then everyone will be together.

174
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,560
You won't feel lonely anymore.

175
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,600
Old hag!

176
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,970
Gin!

177
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,820
Rei!

178
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,770
Rei!

179
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,420
Okami, you're not alone.

180
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,220
Everyone!

181
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,300
Everyone!

182
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,450
You carry all our souls within your heart.

183
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,120
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

184
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,950
I must apologize to them.

185
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,510
I seem to have forced them into terrible penance.

186
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,280
It was neither their wounds, nor regret that kept them in this world.

187
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,190
It was me.

188
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,250
The first time I saw those kids was back when illness took my mother.

189
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,760
I was crying really hard when the Stand appeared before me.

190
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,520
Looking back, now I remember that they always appeared when I was alone.

191
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,860
Soon after, they were next to me, and sometimes would encourage me.

192
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,480
Sometimes we cried together.

193
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:20,590
It became more natural to be with Stands than with other humans.

194
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,290
Friends that only I could see.

195
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,410
I thought that I was chosen.

196
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,480
That it was a power granted to me by the heavens to carry out some important deed.

197
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,570
This inn is for ghosts who failed to get to go to heaven.

198
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,000
They were not able to go to paradise,

199
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,690
but we can at least give them a bath here and help them get to heaven.

200
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,260
I helped a lot of souls go to heaven.

201
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,710
It was satisfying watching them smile before passing away.

202
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,370
However, when my husband passed, I realized something.

203
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,680
That the only beings next to me were... all Stands.

204
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,520
That I...have been alone for a long time.

205
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,000
I'd be really lonely if I lost all the Stands.

206
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,150
And the thought of it made me extremely scared.

207
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,480
They probably understood my weak feelings.

208
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,530
From so long ago...

209
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,790
Yes, from the very first time I met them.

210
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,430
Me, a Stand user?

211
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,400
Give me a break!

212
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,750
Save souls who've lost their place to go?

213
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,460
Stop being so presumptuous!

214
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,550
I was the one being saved.

215
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,480
For the longest time, they've been keeping me company.

216
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,760
They were worried...about me being all alone.

217
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,850
Even when they turned into ghosts... Always...

218
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,170
Yes. They always stayed with me.

219
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,310
Sorry. I'm really sorry, all of you.

220
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,480
Thank you for everything.

221
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,100
That's it!

222
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,270
The inhaled Stands are going to heaven!

223
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,430
Okami!

224
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,660
Okami, you're not alone...all of us...

225
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,920
...we will always be...in your heart.

226
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,870
We will always...always be with you.

227
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,360
I promise...Oiwa.

228
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,740
This is all I know how to do.

229
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,400
I'll just start scrubbing down the backs of skeletons again.

230
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,820
Are you going to manage the inn all by yourself?

231
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,390
I'm not alone anymore.

232
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,760
I have everyone in here now.

233
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,800
I want to save them this time. I'm repaying a favor.

234
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,020
If you can't get to heaven, come back here again. I'll send you to heaven right away!

235
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,290
Having that old hag wash my back doesn't sound very good!

236
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,060
I wonder if Okami is all right.

237
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,180
She looks kind of sad.

238
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,790
I think she'll be okay.

239
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,730
Re...Rei?! What are you doing here?!

240
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,870
I thought you went to heaven.

241
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,090
Well, I feel like I still have something to do in this world.

242
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,180
But don't worry. The reason I came back here isn't because I was worried about you.

243
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,390
It was because there's a man whose back I want to wash.

244
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,850
Excuse me.

245
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,530
Welcome to Senbokyo bathhouse.

246
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:26,700
Please do not cry

247
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:33,680
atop my grave.

248
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,350
For I am not there.

249
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,960
I am not asleep.

250
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,060
A thousand winds...

251
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:57,970
I've become a thousand winds

252
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:04,280
And now I'm blowing

253
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,140
across the great, big sky.

254
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,850
[Preview]

255
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,810
What? The next episode is about leveraging Gintama?

256
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,600
That sounds awfully familiar. What? No?

257
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,010
It's about leveraging Gintaman? That sounds even more familiar.

258
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,220
The next episode:

259
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,640
"Before Thinking About The Earth, Think About The More Endangered Gintaman's Future!"

260
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,680
[We did get ourselves purified, but we still had a few accidents this week as well.]

261
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,970
[Today's word of wisdom: Get yourselves purified as soon as possible!!]

262
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,040
[See you again next time!]
