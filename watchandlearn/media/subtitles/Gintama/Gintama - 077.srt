2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,230
Everyone... Farewell...

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,310
Hey.

4
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,380
[Shinpachi and Kondo take on the Yagyu clan to bring back Otae who is marrying Kyubei.]

5
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,090
[Gintoki and his friends rush to the scene! Can they win against the Yagyu clan?]

6
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,890
Kyubei, I'm disappointed in you.

7
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,910
I sent you on your journey

8
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,380
to train in the martial arts so that you could perfect our Yagyu Chingage style of swordsmanship.

9
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,120
Now you return all of a sudden with that girl and tell me you want to marry her?

10
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,150
What were you doing these past three years?

11
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,880
Searching for a wife?!

12
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,470
With all due respect, Father...

13
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,030
Silence! I don't want you calling me "Father"!

14
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,870
I told you to call me "Papa"! "Daddy" is okay, too!

15
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,800
Kyubei, our Yagyu clan

16
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,980
is made of trueborn celebrities who have served the Shogun's family for generations.

17
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,710
Our duty is to continue the Yagyu style of swordsmanship and keep our celebrity blood intact.

18
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,180
Look at me-the truth is, I hate Persian cats.

19
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm allergic to them. But I put up with them because I'm a celebrity.

20
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,580
Otae-chan is certainly cute.

21
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,960
But she's a mere daughter of a town dojo, and you're the successor to the Yagyu clan.

22
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,130
That's not balance.

23
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,250
Is it your intention to end our celebrity bloodline right here?

24
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,560
Just a minute, Kyubei! I'm not done yet.

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,800
People grow strong in order to protect something.

26
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,020
You can go on protecting what you want to protect, Papa.

27
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,330
I will protect the person I cherish.

28
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,200
I made a vow on this left eye I lost...

29
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,880
Hey! Just a minute, Kyubei!

30
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,910
Koshinori-sama!

31
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,190
What is it?

32
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,940
Shinpachi!

33
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,710
Why didn't you at least say something before doing something like this?!

34
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,890
Planning to do something this much fun all by yourself!

35
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,120
From now on, I'm calling you Sneakypachi!

36
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,690
Don't you guys understand that Shinpachi-kun didn't want to get you involved?!

37
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,140
Shut up, Gorilla! Then why are you involved in this?

38
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,120
Because of my ego!

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Otae-san is marrying into this clan by choice!

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,420
I don't know her reasons, but...

41
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,500
there's no way she'd say good-bye with that face!

42
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,440
Maybe this isn't what Otae-san wants!

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,800
Only people who have a bone to pick, are supposed to be here.

44
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,450
There's no duty or anything here.

45
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,880
I can't have people who have nothing to do with this getting involved!

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,780
So why are you guys here?!

47
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,960
Kondo-san, you don't have to worry.

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,260
I came with a bone to pick, too.

49
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,880
I owe the Yagyu, so I came to pay them back.

50
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,930
Just so you know, today's my day off, so you don't have to be concerned about that.

51
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,330
Kondo-san, I just came because I have a bone to pick, too.

52
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,400
At this rate, I'll have to call a gorilla our missus.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,910
Just so you know, I was supposed to work really hard today, but I took the day off.

54
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,310
You're all about yourself!

55
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,340
What're you talking about? You took today off, too, Kondo-san.

56
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,340
I took paid leave.

57
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,230
Gin-san...

58
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,870
I don't care anymore if people say I have a sister complex.

59
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,070
I love my sister. I don't want her to leave.

60
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,300
If there were any way to do it, I'd want to stay with her forever. But...

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,470
If he's the person she loves from the bottom of her heart,

62
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,190
even if he's a shady bastard who never has money...

63
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,810
or if he's a gorilla stalker...

64
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,600
or a mayo maniac or a hardcore sadist...

65
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,320
If Sis can be happy, then I'm prepared to send her off as I cry...

66
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,820
But...

67
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,410
to send Sis off with tears in her eyes...

68
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,060
I'd die before I let that happen.

69
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,080
I want Sis to always be smiling.

70
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,120
Gin-chan? What'll happen if Big Sis really does love that shrimp?

71
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,510
We'd be total jerks.

72
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,850
We're used to being jerks...and getting in people's way.

73
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,600
Shinpachi, remember this:

74
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,340
We're not doing this for justice or for your sister.

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,490
We're doing it for you.

76
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,890
Let me make it clear. I'm not on your side.

77
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,230
It's just that we share the same enemy.

78
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,790
Isn't he stereotypical? He thinks he's Vegeta.

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,790
[Note: Refers to Vegeta from Dragonball.]

80
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,380
He's planning on casually joining in.

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,060
We're far from being comrades, but with this group,

82
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,840
we just might be able to beat the Yagyu.

83
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,980
Shall we go, brother?

84
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,100
Who're you calling "brother"?

85
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,720
["Yesterday's Enemy, After All Is Said and Done, Is Still the Enemy"]

86
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,460
Did you hear?

87
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,420
That girl the Young Lord brought back

88
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,660
is getting run through the mill by Granny as part of her bride training.

89
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,070
A pity. It's only a matter of time before she runs away.

90
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,540
She was my type, too.

91
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,280
Hey, Kitaoji,

92
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,030
aren't you using too much ketchup?

93
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,590
Don't you know?

94
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,130
Ketchup was created to go well with everything.

95
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,120
You're making me sick. Stop it.

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,650
Looking at your dick-face makes me sicker.

97
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,740
What?!

98
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,730
Stop it, Kitaoji, Minamito. You're acting like kids.

99
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,090
I don't have to take that from a guy who eats a kiddie meal lunch at his age!

100
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,120
Shut up, dick-face!

101
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,540
What part?! What part looks like a dick?!

102
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,200
Stop it.

103
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,740
It's just food. You're disgraceful...

104
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,960
A bride, is it?

105
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,650
Seems three years on a martial arts training journey didn't change the Young Lord.

106
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,370
Dammit!

107
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,150
Tojo-san?

108
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,320
Damn Granny!

109
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,730
I told her to stock up on fresh eggs!

110
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,760
The yolk broke again! I'm going to the supermarket!

111
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,170
Calm down, Tojo-san! It's just food!

112
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,690
Shut up! Dick bod!

113
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,840
Now it's my entire body?! Looks like this is getting worse!

114
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,380
Hey, you're dripping egg from your crotch. Are you ovulating?

115
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,820
You deserved that, Sogo.

116
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,440
Ouch! What was that for?!

117
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,600
Well, nice of you to come, dojo busters.

118
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,910
But your remarkable ride ends here.

119
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,830
We are the guardians of the Yagyu clan...

120
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,910
Itsuki Kitaoji.

121
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,560
Sui Minamito.

122
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,340
Tsukamu Nishino.

123
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,160
And Ayumu Tojo.

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,600
Now that you face the Four Yagyu Aces, don't expect to leave here alive.

125
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,040
We don't have business with you.

126
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,580
Bring out your leader. Who are you guys?

127
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,180
Whose 100 percent are you? What 100 percent are you?

128
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,320
Are you 100 percent Yagyu?! You bastards!

129
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:37,000
[Note: Spoof of Strawberry 100%. Based on the Four Yagyu Aces' last names.]

130
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,000
We can't let small fry like you meet the Young Lord.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,100
Throw down your swords! Or our hostage...

132
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,440
What's the hell are you doing?!

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
You said throw them down.

134
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
What kind of way is that to throw them down?!

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,110
Can't you see we have a hostage?!

136
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,100
Sorry, but he's got no value as a hostage.

137
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,940
Kill him! Kill him!

138
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,700
You'll regret this later.

139
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,670
Tojo-dono, let me take care of these guys...

140
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,430
Stop it!

141
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,020
They are relatives of my wife. No rough stuff.

142
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,350
Young Lord!

143
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,000
You come in droves... Shinpachi-kun.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,870
I didn't think your attachment to your sister was this strong.

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,870
I didn't come today as her brother. I came as the head of Kodokan.

146
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,400
Tae Shimura is a valuable member of our dojo.

147
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,610
If you wish for her as your wife, decorum dictates that you come through me.

148
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,140
Decorum? What're you talking about?

149
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,380
As one who lives for the study of swordsmanship, you should understand.

150
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,320
Samurai settle matters faster with the sword than with words.

151
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,830
A samurai lives by the sword and dies by the sword. That being the case...

152
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,060
Take the woman with your sword.

153
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,670
We want a match with you, you bastard!

154
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,870
A match?

155
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,140
Do you think a match between our Yagyu dojo and your pathetic dojo would even be a fight?

156
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,340
Oh it will, sonny.

157
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,230
The truth is, we members of the Kodokan don't get along at all,

158
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,770
and don't socialize outside of the dojo.

159
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,860
We don't know anything about each other,

160
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,120
and we don't want to. We'd rather see each other die.

161
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,890
But I do know that we're all very strong.

162
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,670
Otae-dono, what is this?

163
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,690
Omelet.

164
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,390
Omelets have always been one of my best dishes.

165
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,910
I thought I had already perfected it,

166
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,290
but I did as you asked, Otaki-san, and improved it.

167
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,440
My repertoire has grown by this much...

168
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,910
Is our kitchen ground zero?

169
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,120
Yes, to an inexperienced wife, the kitchen is a battlefield.

170
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,710
That's not what I meant!
These are completely burnt!

171
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,990
[Note: Refers to BLEACH. At the Soul society, soul reapers all wear black kimono.]

172
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,280
Everything's black! A soul society?! Is this a soul society?!

173
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,990
If you can't cook even a single dish,

174
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,300
it'll be a hundred years before you can marry into the Yagyu clan!

175
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,010
Otaki-san, don't you think it's rather rude for the person

176
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,380
in charge of training the new wife to strike her student?

177
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,080
Young lady! You're not fazed even a bit by my hazing! You are a frightening one!

178
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,150
If this woman marries into the Yagyu clan,

179
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,700
she will most certainly be a threat to me!

180
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,890
Forget it. I'm appalled by you!

181
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,280
Clean up that mess.

182
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,390
You mustn't throw it away. Make sure you eat it all.

183
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,900
Dog food matches you well.

184
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,840
Grandfather, that's supposed to be for the dog.

185
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,920
[Note: Binbokusai literally means "dirt poor."]

186
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,920
Binbokusai-sama! What're you eating?!

187
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,960
It's such a waste! It's still edible.

188
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,290
Edible, inedible is not the point!

189
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,980
The head of the Yagyu should not be doing such things!

190
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,890
You people barged in here. You'll have to follow Yagyu rules.

191
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,780
You want to play Othello?

192
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,930
Just so you know, we're really good at Othello.

193
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,390
We'll take all four corners.

194
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,710
We have plates here.

195
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,300
Each of us will wear these plates somewhere on our bodies and try to break each other's plates.

196
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,970
It'll be six versus six.

197
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,760
The battlefield will be the entirety of the Yagyu premises.

198
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,810
Those whose plates are broken must drop out of the game.

199
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,810
The side that breaks the captain's plate wins.

200
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,950
Those are the only rules.

201
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,800
We will beat that street-style swordsmanship of yours to a pulp

202
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,960
and put an end to any second thoughts.

203
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,460
That's fine with us, you bastards. We won't lose a fight.

204
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,790
Our captain is somewhere in this mansion.

205
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,220
Defeat him, and you win.

206
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,470
By the way, we're not telling you who it is.

207
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,240
We intend to break all your plates, so it doesn't matter who our captain is.

208
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,970
What the hell is this?!

209
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,950
I'm really angry! I'm not letting those guys have Otae-san!

210
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,320
She was never yours, either.

211
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,480
That pisses me off! Let's play with our captain out in the open!

212
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,500
So they can get him at any time!

213
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,280
That's not okay! He'd be KO'ed with one blow!

214
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,990
You're making me the captain?!

215
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,490
Naturally.

216
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,030
It's not how we wanted it, but we've become Kodokan students.

217
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,560
You don't have to worry!

218
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,550
I'll protect Shinpachi-kun with my life! Besides,

219
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,400
we have a lot to talk about.

220
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,670
Will she live with me, or will I live at your place?

221
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,970
Excuse me! Choose someone else!

222
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,890
More importantly, where is everyone going to wear their plates?

223
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,150
Since Hijikata-san has no intention of losing, he's going to wear his on his eye.

224
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,720
You trying to get my eye gouged out?!

225
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,000
Whether you worry or not, it's going to break when the time comes!

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
Just place them wherever.

227
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,790
I'll place mine here.

228
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,230
Why on me?!

229
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,850
It's your plate!

230
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,540
If it's only one eye, you'll be the same as that other character!

231
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,680
Couldn't you figure that out?

232
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,910
Think, Hijikata! You can do it, Hijikata!

233
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,200
Shut up you sadist duo!

234
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,180
Gin-chan!

235
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,770
I have a great idea! I'll put it under my foot!

236
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,370
They can't see it when I walk! Isn't that awesome? They'll never figure it out!

237
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,620
Ouch! I stepped on something. I cut my foot.

238
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,370
You can't fool us! What have you done?!

239
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,160
You crushed the plate before the match even began!

240
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,260
What'll we do about this? What'll we do?!

241
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,230
Go get a replacement!

242
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,490
Go to someone at the Yagyu household and get a replacement!

243
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,100
Wait. We don't know what the enemy is planning.

244
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,860
It's dangerous to move about alone. We'll form pairs.

245
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,720
Hijikata-san.

246
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,730
The hardcore sadist duo went off by themselves.

247
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,240
Excuse me...

248
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,250
Mind if we borrow a plate for a while?

249
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,620
Are you throwing a party?

250
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,250
You might say so.

251
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,260
Here...

252
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,960
Here. Use this.

253
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,140
No. It's got soy sauce on it.

254
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,250
All right, I'll use the one with soy sauce on it. You use mine.

255
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,150
I don't want to. It has mayo on it.

256
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,470
No, it doesn't.

257
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,920
Cut it out! This all started because of you...

258
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,220
I like that plate!

259
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,750
How do you plan on fighting while carrying that huge plate?

260
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,200
It has to be that plate.

261
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,860
You want me to smash your mayo plate to bits, too?

262
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,360
You...

263
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,860
The signal to start...

264
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,650
Hey! There's no time to be dawdling...

265
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,750
Guess I have no choice but to settle for the mayo plate.

266
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,650
Just a minute...

267
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,900
Wait! My plate...

268
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,620
Okay, she'll be first.

269
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:30,010
Deeper...deeper...all the way...

270
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,660
Grandfather, please stop sexually harassing me.

271
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,850
To think that the little girl who played with Kyubei is coming here as his bride...

272
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,580
A little deeper...as far as you can go...

273
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,760
If I dig any deeper, I might dig out something very important.

274
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,330
As long as I've known you, Otae-kun, you've always been smiling,

275
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,760
so it's difficult to know what you're thinking.

276
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,470
It's as if you're hiding something...

277
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,760
I'm not hiding anything! I didn't see anything!

278
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,260
Is...that so?

279
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,710
I just can't help but think you're still bothered by that time...

280
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,790
If not, then that's fine.

281
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,150
It might be a thorny path ahead, but I'm rooting for you two young ones.

282
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,130
Where are you going, Grandfather?

283
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,890
Seems we have some rowdy visitors.

284
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,610
I have to go.

285
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,090
Tsk... I missed the plate.

286
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,870
However...

287
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,580
You cannot escape...

288
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,470
our combo...!

289
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,940
Hey.

290
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,810
I'm going to get that girl.

291
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,210
Minamito!

292
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,090
Owie...

293
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,060
Hijikata-san...what is that? That huge target?

294
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,630
A handicap.

295
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,970
Hey Kitaoji. How's my face look?

296
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,640
Like a dick.

297
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,370
I was talking about my injuries.

298
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,610
It's covered with blood. Better hurry to your urologist.

299
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,920
Get off of that!

300
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,490
Oh...

301
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,260
A handsome guy looks good even when he's bleeding.

302
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,480
Hey Nishino, come here. Join us for a photo.

303
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,940
Geez... You're such a kid.

304
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,670
It's a souvenir. It's not that often we get injured.

305
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,870
Doesn't it look cool? Having blood on my face.

306
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,440
This is turning into a very interesting fight.

307
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,520
Why are you guys shooting in main frame?

308
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,650
It didn't work at all. Didn't even break the plate.

309
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,950
If I'd been with the Odd Jobs trio, we'd have finished them off.

310
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,600
Feeling homesick?

311
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,410
You were almost defeated?

312
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,200
Sogo, what happened to the Odd Jobs?

313
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,290
He'll be fine by himself.

314
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,150
You left Gin-chan alone?!

315
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,020
I'm going to find Gin-chan!

316
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,200
Gin-chan doesn't look it, but he gets lonely!

317
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,590
Hey! You're the lonely one! Don't move around by yourself!

318
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,270
Wait up, young lady.

319
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,190
You'll all be defeated anyway. Doesn't matter if you help him...

320
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,860
Get out of my way!

321
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,540
Those two idiots over there will be your opponents.

322
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,470
You kids can play swordfight together.

323
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,220
I like you! And that demon-like strength of yours!

324
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,760
I, Tsukamu Nishino, will be your opponent.

325
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Hey!

326
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,990
Your opponent is over here...

327
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,240
The Demon Vice-Chief of the Shinsengumi.

328
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,820
I, Itsuki Kitaoji, will show you what a real samurai is.

329
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,620
Suits me just fine.

330
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,520
That leaves you for me. I'm Sui Minamido.

331
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,290
What do you say, young man?

332
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,160
Let's say no attacks to the face.

333
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,450
We both have women who'd cry if something happened, right?

334
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,070
Don't worry about that.

335
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,620
Unlike you celebrities, we country samurai aren't popular with women.

336
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,120
Oh come on, I was trying to help you out.

337
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,650
Shut up. I get it.

338
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,380
If it's not your face, I can mess you up as much as I want.

339
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,150
You won't win that way. You have to break the plate.

340
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,900
What?

341
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,120
I didn't come here to break plates.

342
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,380
I came to beat you people to a pulp.

343
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,390
This...can't be...

344
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,940
This guy is ridiculously strong!

345
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,890
Oh, so this is where you were hiding it.

346
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,020
And what's more...

347
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,510
I have to beat you so I don't hit your face or the plate.

348
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,500
He's a hardcore sadist!

349
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,640
Minamito, why're you struggling with that kid?

350
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,180
That kid is dangerous...

351
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,110
What's the problem? He's no match for you.

352
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,350
Shut up! I'm not feeling well.

353
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,530
Hey, your arm...

354
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,340
You lost the use of your arm when you were protecting the plate...

355
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,370
Bending it back the opposite way should fix it.

356
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,940
Just a minute! I don't think you should do that...

357
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,430
Huh? Did I bend it the wrong way?

358
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,670
Why you...

359
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,770
What'd you do that for, you damn brat!

360
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,780
You broke it! I heard it snap!

361
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,680
Damn you! Most people don't kick hard enough to break bones!

362
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,800
Gin-chan says "an eye for an eye."

363
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,290
This match is done.

364
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,440
It's the ultimate stupidity to let the match get away because of infighting...

365
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,360
Hand over your plates.

366
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,540
No way!

367
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,570
It's useless. Samurai who can't use their arm or their leg are useless.

368
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,300
Samurai should face their end with grace.

369
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,920
Hmph.

370
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,140
With grace?

371
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,220
Unfortunately, we country samurai don't subscribe to that sort of Bushido.

372
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,820
So we're samurai who can't use an arm and a leg...

373
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Hey, which do you hate more: teaming up with me or losing to them?

374
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,370
Both of you can go to hell.

375
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,190
I feel the same way.

376
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,150
But...

377
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,830
Gin-chan says to give back double what people do to you.

378
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,070
Come on out, country samurai!

379
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,020
We're over here, big stuff.

380
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,840
Let's have our final match.

381
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,340
Bring it on!

382
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,340
What's with that?

383
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,280
I can't use my leg; she can't use her arm. But if we cooperate...

384
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,050
Hey! Don't put your crotch so close to me! It's sickening!

385
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,350
I can't help it!

386
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,450
You think you can dodge my sword like that?!

387
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,970
We're incredibly light on our feet. Shall we do a tap dance for you?

388
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,640
I can't tap.

389
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,600
She says she can't tap dance, dammit!

390
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,130
I don't have time to play kiddy games!

391
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,790
Hey!

392
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,300
The bottom's doing all the dodging, but the top's taking all the hits!

393
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,180
Time out!

394
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,410
Hmph.

395
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,860
I was waiting for that.

396
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,100
This can't be! He planned this?!

397
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,790
Now!

398
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,560
The strategist is beaten by his own strategy!

399
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,110
