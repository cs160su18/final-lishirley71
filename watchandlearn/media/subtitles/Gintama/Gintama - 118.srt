[The summer vacation special "Ryugu Arc."
You'll see the final episode this week!]

[Otohime is plotting to turn everyone on Earth into senior
citizens. Will Katsura and Gintoki be able to stop her?!]

["Even if Your Back is Bent, Go Straight Forward"]

5
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,270
Hey! Look at that!

6
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,710
A huge treasure box!

7
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,100
Don't tell me... Otohime-sama is going to
blast Ryugu Palace and the rest of us.

8
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,310
Damn it!

9
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,830
Get out of here!

10
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,420
Are you all right?

11
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,740
Gin-san, the aging gas has
spread over here, too!

12
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,430
Otohime is trying to turn Ryugu Palace
and all her followers into old folks!

13
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,870
We've already been turned into old
men, so it really doesn't matter.

14
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,770
What an irresponsible thing to say!

15
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,200
Who's setting off fireworks at midnight?!

16
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,780
Is that Takasugi-san's goons?

17
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,550
It's hopeless!

18
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,420
I want to see him.

19
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,010
I want to be as beautiful as
I was when he first saw me.

20
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,600
And when he finally awakens,

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,410
I want to welcome him the
same way I did before.

22
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,070
That way he won't feel lonely.
How sad, Otohime...

23
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,610
After so much time has passed...

24
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,350
...have her feelings twisted
into something ugly?

25
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,010
Youth and beauty aren't what's important.

26
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,820
It's more difficult to walk straight and
true if your back is bent to begin with.

27
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,300
As they say...

28
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,890
It's better if you make your soul beautiful!

29
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,680
...Well, I guess what you're
saying makes sense...

30
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,770
but I don't understand at all.

31
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,870
You're great, Gintoki. You said
exactly the right thing.

32
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,210
I prefer Mie-chan, too.

33
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,910
What are you guys talking about?!
That's all about the Pink Lady!

34
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,740
[Note: Pink Lady was a female pop music duo
made up of "Mie" and "Kei" from the 1970s.]

35
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,740
You're so out of date. Catch up, dude!

36
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,320
Hey, Zura. Even though you've turned
into a worn-out old man...

37
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,450
...can you still...

38
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,930
...run straight?

39
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,230
To whom do you think are you talking to?

40
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,140
Even though my eyesight is worse,
I can still see clearly...

41
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,400
The right way to go...

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,110
...I can see it straight and clear.

43
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,310
I see it too.

44
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,800
Then let's go...

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,300
...so we can help rehabilitate
a 3,000-year-old woman.

46
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,290
Gin-san, Katsura-san, it's impossible!
Your bodies are too...

47
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,580
It's all over now. The world will
sink into the deep, dark sea.

48
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,360
I'll become the only beautiful
person in this whole world.

49
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,190
Cannon... Fire!

50
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,090
What's going on?

51
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,080
Someone is hacking into
the main computer.

52
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,870
Fifteen minutes until the system recovers
and the Old Age Cannon fires.

53
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,820

N-No way...

66
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,860

They're heading towards the cannon!

70
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,770
Are they going to stop the Heavenly
Old Age Cannon from firing?

71
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,220
Ten minutes until the system recovers
and the Old Age Cannon fires.

72
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,410
Stupid fools! You're too
old and slow to make it!

Capture them immediately!

They're too slow! Both the
enemies and my soldiers!

You bastards! This isn't a picnic!

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,490
Damn it! I completely miscalculated
the situation!

77
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,920
I shouldn't have gassed the soldiers!

78
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,340
Humph. Our opponents are old men.

79
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,730
Old men vs. old men. Under these
conditions, we won't ever lose!

Here we go!

good, but they're really pissing me off!

Eight minutes until the system recovers
and the Old Age Cannon fires.

Th-Those old men... N-No
way... This is impossible...

...whom you said were ugly.

99
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,340
Why don't you stop them with
your own ugly, twisted ways?

100
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,650
No matter how many
wrinkles they have...

101
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,490
No matter how far their backs
crumple forward...

102
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,160
Their will is as strong and straight
as a sword and will never break.

103
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,080
Stop them if you can!

104
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,650

will fire in six minutes.

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,480
I did it! Finally, I found it!

107
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,770
The last weapon that can save the world!

108
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,330
What's that?

109
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,250
It's a vaccine!

110
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,980
It's a bullet filled with a
vaccine that neutralizes

111
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,370
the Aging virus Otohime
unleashed upon Edo.

112
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,950
If we put this in the gun-port
lid of the cannon,

113
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,620
...and let it fire, everyone
will return to normal.

Well done, Shintaro-kun.

115
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,730
I didn't quite get all that, but
we stick that up the butt...

116
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,610
Katsura-san, that's not what I said!

117

This has nothing to do with butts!

We won't be able to reach the cannon
unless we climb up these stairs!

124
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,240
The Old Age Cannon will
fire in five minutes.

Hurry up and get them!

128
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,630
It'll be over if they reach the cannon!

129

Over there!

130
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,520
Get them!

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,990
Damn it!

132
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,920
Gin-san, Katsura-san, hurry it up!

133
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,370

135
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,750
You know, old men hate stairs and the
sound of their old wives' teeth grinding!

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,680
...but...I love her in my heart
more than anybody else!

137

I didn't ask you! And you
don't even have a wife!

138

Come on! What are you doing?!

139
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,780

Don't slow down, speed walk!

148

O-Old granny, you've already
had breakfast.

159
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,750
Oh, really? I'm sorry then.

160
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,020
Yes!

161
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,810
Michuko-san, Michuko-san,
isn't my lunch ready yet?

162
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,660
I just said you already had breakfast!

163
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,010
I see... I haven't even had lunch
yet... So, is breakfast ready yet?

164
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,660
I told you that you already had breakfast!

165
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,880
I see. I had breakfast, and haven't
had lunch yet, which means...

166
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,220
Isn't my Tandori Chicken Bourgogne-style
pie ready yet?

167
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,590
What kind of meal is that?
It sounds far too gourmet.

168
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,750
What kind of meal is that?

169
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,500
Michuko-san, Michuko-san.

170
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,920
Do you know where my eyepatch is?

171
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,840
You're wearing it on your left eye!

172
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,750
Michuko-san, Michuko-san,
Michuko-san...

173
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,220
Shut up, already! I'm not Michuko!

174
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,470
Hello, Hachibei? Mom is really tired.

175
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,340
I can't get along with
Michuko-san anymore.

176
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,170
Don't call up your son!

177
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,880
Hello, Hachibei. Isn't my Tandori
Chicken ready yet?

178
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,390
Well...yeah, please get it on
your way back from work.

179
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,890
Don't ask her son to get
Tandori Chicken for you!

180
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,340
We won't let you...

181
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,260
...take a single step further!

182
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,380
Y-You guys...!

183
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,840
The Old Age Cannon will
fire in three minutes.

184
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,400
The Old Age Cannon will
fire in two minutes.

185
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,990
Shinpachi!

186
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,370
The cannon will fire in...

187
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,340
...under one minute.

188
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,350
The countdown begins now.

189
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,040
60 seconds... 59 seconds...

190
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,720
That one. If we put this vaccine
into the butt of the cannon,

191
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,380
both it and the aging gas will
spread through the world.

192
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,680
I won't let you! I won't let you do it!

193
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,210
I won't allow a single person
to stand in my way!

194
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,670
Otohime!

195
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:20,620
Ten... Nine... Eight...
Seven... Six... Five...

196
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,450
Four...

197
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,540
Three...

198
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,730
Two...

199
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,700
One...

200
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,470
Heavenly Old Age Cannon...

201
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,420
Fire!

202
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,580
I win! I win...

203
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,430
The vaccine...

204
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,060
Zura, let's aim for the cannon's butt.

205
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm not Zura. I'm Katsura.

206
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,570
Otohime!

207
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,570
Watch carefully! This is the real...

208
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,890
...gateball!

209
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,380
Huh?

210
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,520
Oh...? My wrinkles... No kidding...

211
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,040
Wow!

212
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,720
We've returned to normal!

213
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,580
Gin-san! Katsura-san!

214
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,440
Hey!

215
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,000
The reason I was defeated is...

216
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,160
The reason I was defeated is...

217
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,500
because I underestimated
old men like you.

218
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,370
I never thought I'd be defeated
by the people

219
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,240
I hated and thought were ugly.

220
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,580
We couldn't have done
it without that man.

221
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,160
The man who spoke through
the computer

222
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,870
and told us about the Anti-aging vaccine.

223
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,050
He's probably the same person you've been
waiting for all this time, Otohime-san.

224
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,290
He asked us to save you.

225
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,680
You've got to be kidding me. He's...

226
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,630
...still in deep sleep, frozen inside
the deep-freeze capsule... And...

227
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,030
Are you telling me that because he's
been in there for such a long time,

228
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,290
his consciousness has entered
Ryugu's main computer?

229
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,300
I don't know. But one thing
I can say for certain is,

230
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,090
you've been thinking of
him for a long time.

231
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,360
And that man inside there...

232
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,030
...in the darkness...has been
thinking of you, too.

233
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,570
Like a pearl that glitters in the deep sea.

234
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,700
...guiding you so you'd never get lost.

235
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,160
Dang! It's too heavy!

236
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,420
Hey, get more people.

237
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,520
That's enough.

238
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,970
I said that's enough.

239
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,010
Tell all the soldiers that Ryugu
Palace will soon be destroyed.

240
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,410
To avoid damaging the city...

241
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,660
...steer the palace towards sea.

242
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,570
Everyone must leave the
palace, even the mice.

243
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,550
Of course, those guys, too.

244
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,280
But Princess, what about you?

245
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,570
Hurry and leave now!

246
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,130
Otohime!

247
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,640
I'll never be able to see
him again, anyway.

248
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,850
I'm too tired to wait any more

249
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,920
hundreds of thousands of years alone.

250
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,630
I've already waited this long.

251
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,620
And not only my body, but
also my soul has decayed.

252
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,690
But...because of you guys...

253
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,820
I was able to realize my
wrongs at the very end.

254
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,180
Not once, but twice...

255
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,890
My selfish desires lead to leaving
him all alone again.

256
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,870
I thank you. I can see it now...

257
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,220
...clearly, the light that
you carried to me...

258
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,060
Thank you.

259
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,870
Otohime!

260
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,650
Urashima-sama.

261
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,410
In the end, I wasn't able to see you...

262
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,330
...in this world.

263
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,270
But at least, in the deep sea,
I hope to sleep next to you...

264
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,800
...That's my only wish.

265
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,100
You fool...

266
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,250
...Why did you wait for him for hundreds
of thousands of years?

267
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,410
...Why do you only remember
a few of his words

268
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,270
amongst the thousands you've heard?

269
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,670
You're... absolutely beautiful.

270
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,830
It's because those words weren't
describing your appearance

271
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,030
but your soul, right?

272
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,360
You fell in love with that man's
soul, didn't you?

273
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,950
Even if you grow to be full of wrinkles
or your back hunches over,

274
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,870
it won't matter at all.

275
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,260
Even if you get dentures
and they get all stained,

276
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,030
or you need to wear adult diapers...

277
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,710
...just live...and show him your
smile in a face full of wrinkles!

278
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,870
Old hag!

279
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,110
Everyone, no matter how beautiful,

280
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,910
grows wrinkled and dies in the end.

281
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,430
But even if their looks change,

282
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,340
there's always some things
that never change.

283
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,040
Even if our bodies are destroyed.

284
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,430
No matter how many years pass.

285
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,250
Why me?!

286
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,630
We believe there's something
that can never be destroyed.

287
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,050
But even if we become wrinkled,
we still won't lose to you.

288
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,850
That's because we know
what true beauty is.

289
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,130
Good grief. I thought I gathered up
brave warriors to defeat Otohime,

290
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,760
but it looks like I drew some wild cards.

291
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,830
What are you guys doing?! Hurry
up and get out of here!

292
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,460
Are you going to waste Otohime-sama's
concern for us?

293
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,660
Aren't you guys going to try to save her?

294
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,790
It's Otohime-sama's last
order! We can't disobey!

295
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,420
Humph. Sorry, but I'm a rebel.

296
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,270
I don't have any obligation to listen
to any of Otohime-sama's orders.

297
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,140
...Then now we're rebels, too!

298
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,060
Yeah!

299
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,510
Save Otohime-sama!

300
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,800
Oh, hi! Welcome!

301
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,900
Damn it! Let me die! A guy
like me should just die!

302
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,040
Even if I live, there's nothing
good that can happen!

303
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,330
Hey, hey, just calm down.

304
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,840
I'd assist you in committing
seppuku any time.

305
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,150
Please have a seat wherever you like.

306
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,400
I'm sorry about the noise.

307
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,440
Did you get dumped by
a woman again?

308
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,080
You just never learn, do you?

309
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,760
Here, drink this and forget about her.

310
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,690
Mama! I like you, Mama!
Please marry me!

[Note: In Japan, customers often
call female bar owners Mama.]

312
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,390
I'm sorry, but I already have someone.

313
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,800
Hmm. That's news to us. We'd
like to hear more about it.

314
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,190
That's a lie! Don't be a
braggart, you old hag!

00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,100
As a matter of fact, I used to
be the queen of a palace.

317
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,550
I was really beautiful back then.

318
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,390
Ryugu Palace, right?

319
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,630
The queen of the Ryugu Palace
Snack House, right?

320
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:37,280
Then let me ask you, "Otohime-sama."
How do I get a woman?

321
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,680
Well, if you're a real man, don't
say anything more, and...

322
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,600
You're so beautiful.

323
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,130
No, no, brother, that's too
stereotypical a line!

324
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,350
There's no sense in that at all!

325
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,050
This is the second time in my life...

326
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,320
...that I've seen this beautiful woman.

327
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,170
Otohime-sama, you're still
absolutely beautiful,

328
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,320
just as you were when I last saw you.

330
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,970
Let me smoke, damn it!

331
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,680
Damn. Before we know it, there'll be
no place for us smokers.

332
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,690
I can't stand it anymore.
At this rate, I... I...
