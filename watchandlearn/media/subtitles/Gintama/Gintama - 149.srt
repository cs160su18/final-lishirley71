00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,390
Hijikata and Okita have been captured by the mysterious man, Jigzaw,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,540
and locked up in a deserted building.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:17,630
In order to escape, they must obtain a single key provided by Jigzaw.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,430
But only one person can use the key to unlock his chains and escape the room.

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,280
When one's shackle is released, the other's will explode.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,200
And if one of them doesn't escape soon,

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,460
the Shinsengumi station will be blown to pieces by Jigzaw's bomb.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,640
Kill one comrade to save the others.

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:53,130
That would be the game of death Jigzaw has given the Shinsengumi to test their strong bond.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,020
And as for the new assassin Jigzaw has unleashed...?

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,850
What will happen to the Shinsengumi?

13
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,270
Why are you doing the summary?!

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,070
What will happen, my ass!

15
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,760
You're the one who set this whole thing up!

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,730
Why are you talking like you have nothing to do with this?!

17
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,500
The hell is wrong with your head?!

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,430
I'm being considerate for the audience who missed the previous episode.

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,040
We want to help them understand what's going on.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,440
How come you're nice to the audience?!

21
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,580
Th-That's...

22
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,160
Wh-What...

23
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,790
I would like to introduce...

24
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,930
[Note: Kickzaw is a play on Kikuzo, the name of popular comic storyteller, Kikuzo Hayashiya]

25
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,600
...my beloved dog, Kickzaw.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,930
Isn't he adorable?

27
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,650
He has an odd habit.

28
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,850
He always tends to pick up shiny objects when we go for a walk.

29
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,560
Well, let's see what he picked up today.

30
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,920
N-N-N-N-Not good!

31
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,870
This is bad!

32
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,980
Very bad!

33
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,090
He's definitely going to take it!

34
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,930
This isn't the time to whine about details!

35
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,540
Getting backstabbed is no longer the problem!

36
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,380
If he takes it, it's over!

37
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,150
No more escape or preventing the station from blowing up!

38
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,060
Huh? Hijikata-san, you're sweating really hard.

39
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,270
Are you scared about the key being taken?

40
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,610
Huh? What?

41
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,760
No way. Not at all.

42
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,850
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,430
I said we didn't need it.

44
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,180
It's totally unnecessary.

45
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,390
That's right.

46
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,120
We don't need that traitor's tool.

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,260
Don't need it.

48
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,990
We'll break out of here with our own power.

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,160
Hijikata!

50
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,060
Move one step.

51
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,990
I'll instantly purge you as a traitor!

52
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,280
Sogo!

53
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,850
Do you understand the situation we're in?!

54
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,370
Hurry up!

55
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,710
Hurry up and betray me, Hijikata!

56
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,260
Please, I'll give you 300 yen.

57
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,170
Go, Sogo!

58
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,140
Don't be so stubborn!

59
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,500
Please betray me already!

60
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,360
K-Kickzaw!

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,970
Wait!

62
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,960
Sit! Stay!

63
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,150
Shake hands! Stay!

64
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,240
Stay! Stay!

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,870
Can't you hear what I'm saying?!

66
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,330
Want me to kill you, stupid dog?!

67
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,420
He stopped.

68
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,530
What a relief...

69
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,200
K-Kickzaw!

70
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,720
Safe...

71
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,350
D-Damn it!

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
Hijikata!

73
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,320
You've finally showed your true colors!

74
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,230
Sogo Okita, Captain of the 1st Division, shall purge you as a traitor!

75
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,180
I-It'd be dangerous if the dog swallowed it.

76
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,500
Okay, now it's safe.

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,540
Wh-What are you doing?!

78
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,890
["When breaking a Chuubert in half, the end with the knob should be better. It's also tasty to drink from there."]

79
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,270
W-Water...

80
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,480
Somebody give me water...

81
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,230
I-It's useless...

82
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,390
My body won't listen to me...

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,590
Hijikata-san, this is it.

84
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,670
We've spent two days beating on this pipe without any sleep.

85
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,050
It's been three days since we've had anything to eat...

86
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,010
Yet we haven't even found a single clue to aid our escape.

87
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,020
Stand up, Sogo...

88
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,080
The fate of the Shinsengumi rests on our shoulders...

89
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,620
Less than 24 hours left before the station will be blown up...

90
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,830
We have to hurry...

91
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,080
Hurry up and escape...

92
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,680
Good day, Hijikata-kun, Okita-kun.

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,530
Hey!

94
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,380
Your mask is half off.

95
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,270
You have less than a day left

96
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,520
till the station explodes.

97
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,990
[Note: Spoof of Japanese ice candy, Tupet.]

98
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,990
He's eating a Chuubert!

99
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,220
It's like he's tired of pretending to be a mysterious character!

100
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,640
Oh?

101
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,980
It appears that you two will collapse before the station does.

102
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,900
Are you hungry?

103
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,790
Do you want some water?

104
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,220
I'm pissed! He's pissing me off!

105
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,450
Fools.

106
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,170
I gave you a chance to escape and save the station,

107
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,890
yet you threw it away...

108
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:27,950
However, I have seen many people spout noble ideology under a thin mask,

109
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,560
but you are the first ones with such a thick mask.

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,390
However, in the end, you still won't have been able to escape.

111
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,010
It may appear that you are acting in the best interests of your comrades,

112
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,610
but in reality, you merely don't want to dirty your hands and will cause many of them to die.

113
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,360
I wouldn't mind seeing you all perish together,

114
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
but that wouldn't make for a fun game.

115
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,580
I shall give you one last chance.

116
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,130
Okay?

117
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,160
If you lose this chance, there won't be any way to save you or the Shinsengumi.

118
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,970
There are lockers on each side of you.

119
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,090
Check the locker furthest in.

120
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,190
I've placed another key item there for helping you escape.

121
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,410
Now go.

122
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,240
The time has come to shed those fake masks.

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
Show me your true selves!

124
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,280
The ugliness hidden behind those masks!

125
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,570
[Note: Famitsu is a popular video game magazine in Japan.]

126
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,680
Hiro-kun, I bought your Famitsu!

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,990
Hey, your mom's back again, Hiro-kun.

128
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,660
What? My mom? What are you talking about?

129
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,630
I am Jigzaw, born from nothingness.

130
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,510
I have no mother.

131
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,150
Hiro-kun, why is your door locked?

132
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,260
Hey, be quiet!

133
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,170
The neighbors are so loud.

134
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,300
No, you don't need to bother hiding it.

135
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,500
It's your mom, right?

136
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,230
We already saw her face so let us say hi.

137
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,020
I said she's not my mom!

138
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,680
Don't mess with me, damn it!

139
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,340
Honey, move out of the way!

140
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,520
Hiroshi!

141
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,320
I need to talk to you.

142
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,870
It seems that you were absent from school again today.

143
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,750
Your dad?!

144
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,250
Now your dad showed up!

145
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,370
Stupid hag!

146
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,060
Don't go spilling everything! And don't...

147
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,570
Hey!

148
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,040
There's nothing mysterious about that guy!

149
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,400
He reads Famitsu!

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,070
He only acts strong when he's talking to his mom!

151
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,710
He's the one who's letting his mask fall off!

152
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,120
Man, he's just some withdrawn brat...

153
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,470
Hijikata-san, look at this.

154
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,570
A fridge...?

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,240
Is this some kind of trap?

156
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,420
Let's open it up.

157
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,320
Hey, wait!

158
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,300
That guy's gotta be plotting something...

159
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,190
In that case, do you intend to just stand around doing nothing?

160
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,130
I'm opening it.

161
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,260
This is...!

162
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,030
What?

163
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,510
A Chuubert. Grape-flavored.

164
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,320
How is that supposed to help?!

165
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,950
He probably didn't want us to starve to death before the game ended.

166
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,980
Then give us something more substantial!

167
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,040
So, can I have the longer lower part?

168
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,210
Lower?

169
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,330
Lower is longer?

170
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,820
What are you talking about?

171
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,840
Lower, as in you know, the side you hold.

172
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,270
No, that's where you drink from not where you hold it.

173
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,360
You drink it from here.

174
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,780
Just break here...

175
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,830
Hah? You snip off this part and suck on it! That's what makes it a Chuubert!

176
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,080
It's a Chuubert cause you suck on it till there's only flavorless ice left.

177
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:44,720
Besides, if you eat it by breaking here, the other side will melt!

178
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,000
Chuuberts are usually broken in half and split.

179
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,970
I used to have big arguments with my sister about who would get which half.

180
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,180
Break it in half every time?

181
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,590
Then what are all the only children in the country supposed to do?

182
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,060
They can just get their hands all sticky.

183
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,310
Yeah, you just provoked every single only child in the country!

184
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,860
You definitely did, yeah.

185
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,070
That's fine.

186
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,210
I won't budge on this, even if it means making enemies around the world.

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,230
That is where you're supposed to hold it.

188
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,550
People don't always freeze them before they eat them, you know.

189
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,030
You have to consider when people just drink them as a cold liquid.

190
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,790
If you break here, that'll make a huge mess.

191
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,740
Do you have a fever or something?

192
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,330
Chuuberts are supposed to be frozen.

193
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,030
Wake up, Sogo.

194
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,610
This protruding edge is supposed to be cut.

195
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,500
I don't care what anyone says. That's where you hold it.

196
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Or it wouldn't look like a nipple.

197
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,530
Hey, what did you just say?

198
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,310
Huh?

199
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,650
Nipple? You mean?

200
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,490
What are nipples meant for?

201
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,970
Ah.

202
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,970
Yes, that's right! So we have to change the title for this episode!

203
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,180
["When breaking a Chuubert in half, the end with the knob should be better. Normally, the knob part is used to drink the Chuubert."]

204
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,730
That's right!

205
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,690
Nipples are supposed to be sucked! Got it?

206
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,520
Then can I have the longer upper part?

207
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,290
The part with the nipple?

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,090
Let's use rock-paper-scissors to decide.

209
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,870
Say... He mentioned something about another item.

210
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,350
We've got a coping saw here.

211
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,770
Are we supposed to cut through the chain with this?

212
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,930
He was the one who said the chain wouldn't be easily cut through.

213
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,330
Can't cut through this...

214
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,950
It's no use.

215
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,810
A futile effort.

216
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,120
Besides, considering how much stamina we have left...

217
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,320
The chain's no good, the pipe's no good...

218
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,890
The only other thing to cut is...

219
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,610
Sogo?!

220
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,960
Get a grip! Hey!

221
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,850
I'm sorry, Hijikata-san.

222
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,600
Looks like I can't go on anymore.

223
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,470
Get a hold of yourself!

224
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,230
I'll give you a drink of this Chuubert!

225
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,410
Come on! Get a grip!

226
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,830
It's pretty much melted already.

227
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,460
What's wrong, Sogo?! Hurry up and drink!

228
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,400
I can't drink it.

229
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,940
You want to drink the big side, don't you?

230
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,350
You...

231
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,160
Hijikata-san, that's how you always are...

232
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,390
You compete with me and act tough like you want to kill me,

233
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,140
but deep down inside, you aren't bad enough.

234
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,700
When you see your opponent on the verge of death,

235
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,970
you don't hesitate to offer the longer side of the Chuubert.

236
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,630
If I were in your shoes,

237
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,760
I'd drink both sides myself.

238
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,280
If you aren't capable of that, you'll never beat me, Hijikata-san.

239
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,940
Hijikata-san...

240
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,460
I always couldn't stand that side of you.

241
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,440
The guy who did things I couldn't understand.

242
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,680
The guy who wouldn't do what I wanted.

243
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,430
I've pestered you this whole time to drag you down.

244
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,630
But looking back now, I don't think I actually hated you.

245
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,520
I was probably just jealous...

246
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,570
...jealous of the guy who could easily do the things I couldn't.

247
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,020
...of the guy who possessed what I didn't.

248
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,570
Hijikata-san...

249
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:44,240
Sorry about causing you so much trouble...

250
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,540
Wh-What are you saying, Sogo?

251
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,920
When... When did you start talking like that to me?

252
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,480
This isn't like you.

253
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,960
You're not cut out for this stuff.

254
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,960
I feel the same way.

255
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,750
But I have to tell you now...

256
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,850
It feels like I won't get another chance.

257
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,680
S-Stupid!

258
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,450
Don't get all weak on me!

259
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,930
Don't act so pathetic just because you've missed a few meals!

260
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,210
Get a grip!

261
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,620
You're not going to die from this!

262
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,270
If you're hungry, I'll let you drink as much of this Chuubert as you want!

263
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,170
Come on!

264
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,840
Have my share, too!

265
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,370
Hijikata-san.

266
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,960
Don't you understand?

267
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,410
At least for this one last time, I don't want to get in your way...

268
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,740
I don't need this anymore.

269
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,010
What I need is over there.

270
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,330
You've probably realized what the coping saw is for.

271
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,990
It's not for cutting the chain or the pipe.

272
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,890
It's to cut off one of our heads.

273
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,290
Even if we can't remove the shackles,

274
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,980
if we cut off one person's head, we can slide the chain off the pipe.

275
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,340
He's intent on making us kill one another.

276
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,140
Shut up.

277
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,720
Just drink the Chuubert.

278
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,290
Hijikata-san...

279
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,680
Under normal circumstances, I would have jumped and beheaded you right off the bat.

280
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,440
But unfortunately, I don't have enough strength left to do that...

281
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,240
Even if I did, I still wouldn't be able to make it to the station...

282
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,250
I told you to shut up.

283
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,780
Hurry up and drink this.

284
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,480
Hijikata-san, we're out of time.

285
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,200
It's the only way out of this place.

286
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,400
Shut up...

287
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,990
Hijikata-san...

288
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,490
It hurts me to say this, but you're the only one left who can save the Shinsengumi.

289
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,590
Didn't you hear me tell you to shut up?!

290
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,520
This is an order from the Vice-Chief.

291
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,680
I won't let that happen.

292
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,160
I won't let you die for that stupid bastard.

293
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,520
I won't let you or anyone at the station die!

294
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,150
You're going to leave this place with me alive!

295
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,010
Don't give up.

296
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,750
There has to be a way.

297
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,700
A way for both of us to escape this place.

298
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,340
Hold on.

299
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,980
There might be something else we can use.

300
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,650
I'll find a way out of here without fail!

301
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,090
Hijikata-san...

302
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,290
It ended up being like Jigzaw said.

303
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,690
I had to remove my mask at the very end.

304
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,080
I showed you a side of myself I never wanted you to see.

305
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,880
Please forget everything I just said.

306
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,170
Hijikata-san...

307
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:06,430
Please take care of the Shinsengumi...

308
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,080
I am amazed, Hijikata-kun, Okita-kun.

309
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,810
I didn't expect your bond to be so strong.

310
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,080
The purpose of the game was

311
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,640
to convince fellow comrades to kill one another for the sake of saving the rest of your comrades,

312
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,030
but I didn't expect him to choose his own death to save you.

313
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,120
Your bond is truly strong.

314
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,310
Or perhaps I should say his bond for you was strong.

315
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,050
Aren't you relieved inside, Hijikata-kun?

316
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,810
Thinking, "Now I'm saved."

317
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,760
He didn't only save your life.

318
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,840
By killing himself, he prevented you from getting your hands dirty.

319
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,210
He must have known that you are a coward.

320
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,530
He died so a coward like you would be able to take his head.

321
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,850
You are obligated to carry through with this.

322
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,340
Now, cut off your friend's head.

323
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,600
Put on the mask of deceit and live for your friend's sake.

324
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,320
What are you doing, Hijikata-kun?

325
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,520
That should be obvious.

326
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,830
I'm heading off to sever a head.

327
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,590
His head is on your shoulder.

328
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,390
This isn't the head I'm after.

329
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,720
The one I want to cut off

330
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,190
is the one wearing that filthy mask!

331
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,890
It's futile, Hijikata-kun.

332
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,800
You can't escape from that place on your own.

333
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,840
You should know that after being chained...

334
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,030
What?! I-Impossible!

335
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,810
There's a crack in the pipe!

336
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:25,190
Are you saying that the pipe couldn't bear the extensive beating which was believed to be futile?!

337
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,240
I-I-Impossible!

338
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,770
He escaped on his own power!

339
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,930
He still has a slight pulse.

340
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,530
I won't let you die...

341
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,050
I'm not going to let anyone die!

342
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,220
Sogo, I'm going to save...

343
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,880
C-Crap!

344
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,150
A-At this rate...

345
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,380
At this rate, the chain will bring Sogo down, too.

346
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,270
I have to...

347
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,750
I have to do something about the chain!

348
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,500
Hijikata-san, good work.

349
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,600
It was fun.

350
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,820
Come play with me again?

351
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,090
Man, I'm all sticky cause of the Chuubert.

352
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:55,810
I feel sick.

353
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,790
Ah, the blood was from the Chuubert.

354
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,290
Yeah, good work.

355
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,930
You did a great job.

356
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,640
What are you talking about?

357
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,700
You put on a convincing act yourself.

358
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,510
You were even acting when you talked to yourself.

359
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,210
Like you didn't know me at all.

360
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,250
Yeah, you have to totally become the part for these things.

361
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,560
Have to deceive even the audience.

362
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,030
I see.

363
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,580
I thought you just weren't planning ahead.

364
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,310
I'm impressed!

365
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,430
Then, when you decide on the next target, let me know.

366
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,500
For sure, okay?

367
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,900
Yeah, next time.

368
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,130
I was considering this guy with curly silver hair.

369
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,570
He should provide plenty of fun.

370
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,030
Well, I can't wait.

371
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,920
Good work then!

372
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,200
The next episode...

373
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,040
"If You Can't Beat Them, Join Them."

374
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,720
[The proprietor of Odd Jobs was talking to himself as usual when...]

375
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,720
[...a mysterious man appeared, wielding an incredible power!!]

376
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,020
[See you next time!]
