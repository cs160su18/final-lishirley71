for Amanto that recently opened.

00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,490
Yeah. It's where discrimination
against us Earthlings begins.

7
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,280
They say Amanto VIPs live
it up all day and all night.

Tsk...

9
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,380
Let's go.

10
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,960
May I have your attention, everyone.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,790
I'd like to introduce a new employee.

12

Let's welcome him with
a round of applause.

Let's give him a hand!

Okay, introduce yourself, please.

15
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,230
How do you do? I come
from Nebula Zura78.

16
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,680
My name is Joey Katsura.

Please be good to me.

19
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,500
Isn't he an Earthling?

[No Earthlings Allowed!]

22

No need to be concerned, everyone.

23
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,140
He's just a pitiful lad who's often mistaken
for an Earthling because of he looks.

24
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,510
Isn't that right, Joi-kun?

25
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,490
It's not Joi, it's Joey.

26
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,980
But I'd rather you called me Katsura.

27
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,100
As you know, we don't allow Earthlings.
We serve only Amanto VIPs.

28
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,510
Our specialty is sashimi on a boat.

29
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,270
How surreal.

30
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,460
Did you say something?

31
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,600
Anyway, we have a reservation
today by high-ranking VIPs

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,660
from a royal family of
a planet somewhere.

33
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,110
I'll need you to work hard on
your first day, Joi-kun.

34
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,900
No, please call me Katsura.

35
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,280
Katsura-san!

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,700
Are you serious about posing as
an employee at that restaurant?!

37
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,720
Rumor has it that radicals are
targeting Amanto bigwigs

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,440
at that restaurant and they're planning
to blow it up with the Amanto inside!

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,020
It's reckless to go in there alone!

40
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,210
It's too dangerous!

41
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,590
Don't worry. It's easier if I work alone.

42
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,930
I will put that restaurant out of business
and force it to close for sure...

43
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,680
In this case, I can understand
how the radicals feel.

44
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,410
But if they get violent, there'll
be needless casualties.

45
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,760
That's why, what I need to do
is make the Amanto leave

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,520
before the radicals do anything stupid.

That's reckless!

50
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,950
Come back!

51
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,890
[Be careful.]

52
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,090
Got that, Katsura-kun?

53
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,260
I'm going to introduce you to your
Senpai who'll oversee you.

54
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,100
You, step forward.

55
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,880
As you were.

56
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,590
This is Hata-koh. Although he
joined us just a week ago,

57
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,660
he's still your Senpai, so ask him
anything you need to know.

58
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,500
Um...Have we met before?

59
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,920
I don't remember anyone like you.

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,040
He's to be pitied, as well.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,460
Seems he was mistaken as part of his own
collection and discarded along with them.

62
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,350
Let's see...we don't want
anything in this room.

63
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,350
Take them all away before
that idiot returns.

64
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,380
If you see anything that might
be of worth, leave it here.

65
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,180
Throw everything else out.

66
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,460
Damn old coot!

67
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,400
Anyway, he'll look after
you. Try to get along.

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,680
That's right. Ask me anything.

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,150
Joy Toy, was it?

70
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,560

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,210
No, he's not an S, he's
an M. He can't do S.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,210

Yeah...

75
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,240
Don't worry.

76
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,060
But what if...

77
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,520
I said don't worry.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,410
All I need to do is to set this bomb
to go off after the restaurant closes.

79
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,700
That'll put them out of
business for a while.

80
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,090
Hey, newcomer. What're you
doing? Give me a hand.

81
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,510
I was practicing my S split.

82
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,060
...Oh, you did it.

83
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,390
Done.

84
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,870
That's a lovely sea captain.

85
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,640
I'll buy you anything you want.

86
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,070
Really?

87
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,270
Welcome.

88
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,570
Stop.

89
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,790
Go and clean the windows
or something, newcomer.

90
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,390
But...

91
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,420
Watch and learn.

92
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,400
Hey, Earthling.

93
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,240
This is no place for scum like you.

94
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,830
Tch, I'm not sitting with apes like them.

95
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,840
Just having Earthlings in the
vicinity ruins my appetite.

96
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,080
Apes should eat ape food.

97
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,000
My eyes!

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,570
Hey! What're you doing
to the customer?!

99
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,290
You know, they say the eyes
are the window to the soul.

100
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,710
Not his eyes!

101
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,350
And you, Hata-koh! What're
you teaching him?!

102
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,340
Joey! How useless can
you be?! Do as I do!

103
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,090
Where are you wiping?!

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,380
They say the zipper is the
window to the world.

105
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,600
Shut up!

106
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,850
Huh?

107
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,510
I-It...came off? Y-You...are an Earthling?

108
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,140
Oh, come on. Look
how easily
this comes off. See?

109
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,000
You guys! Quit horsing around
and get back to work!

110
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,460
Why am I stuck doing this sort of work?

111
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,000
Just as I thought, this restaurant is an ugly
place where they make fun of Earthlings.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,570
I'll revert to the original plan, and...

113
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,090
Hey newcomer, what're you doing?

114
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,900
I got a little hungry, so I was looking
for something to snack on...

115
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,910
I found dried squid, see?

116
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,800
That's my charm point!

117
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,840
Just curious, Senpai...

118
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,300
Why are you working at a place like this?

119
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,550
You said you were discarded
by mistake, right?

120
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,230
Why not go home?

121
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,100
Well...because John is here.

122
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,380
...John?

123
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,830
Yes. John, the space lobster who
lives in the restaurant's fish tank.

124
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,070
He's a lovable sort. I fell in love
with him the moment I saw him.

125
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,160
If I'm not careful, there's no telling
when John might get eaten.

126
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,800
I can't leave him.

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,010
If everyone believed in "love and peace"
and loved animals like I do,

128
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,870
everything would be fine.

129
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,880
Well, I'm worried about John,
so I'll go back first.

130
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,680
Love and peace, eh?

131
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,800
If I detonate this, the tank
and John won't survive.

132
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,860
It's a tiny life, but if there are casualties,

133
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,280
then I'm no different than the radicals.

134
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,370
I will use my own methods...

135
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,600
...to accomplish my ambition.

136
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,430
Wh-Who are you?!

137
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,410
This is divine retribution!

138
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,000
We've come to pass judgment
on the likes of you who

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,580
discriminate against Earthlings and
undermine and ruin our country!

140
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,750
Go repent in hell!

141
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,840
Hmph. Anti-Foreigner Faction samurai,
eh? I figured as much.

142
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,650
I'm ready for you.

143
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:55,300
Uh-oh...what's going on? If these
guys start fighting here...

144
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,570
the tank...

145
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,640
and my John...

146
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,820
Darn! I didn't think the radicals
would show up so soon.

147
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,810
Stop it!

148
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,640
I won't allow this! You're all
fools with no compassion!

149
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,250
You mustn't injure him!

150
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,350
Don't put a single scratch
on his precious shell!

151
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,890
If you do, I'll...I'll...

152
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,810
I won't forgive you!

153
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,060
Are you talking about Amanto lives?!

154
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,870
Then I'll start by...

155
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,660
killing you first!

156
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,260
What?!

157
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,020
Huh?

158
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,350
...No more...no more bloodshed...let
there be...

I finally learned that today. Yes...

What's the meaning of this commotion?!

169
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,290
I was having a great time after finally

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,590
finding a replacement for
the idiot I disposed of!

171

Isn't that right, my new Prince?

172
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,200
You see! The Prince is angry!

173
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,050
...Huh?

174
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,190
That's odd...there are two Princes.

I must say it took a long
time to get to this point.

183
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,260
Since joining this shop as an apprentice,

184
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,070
Chef wouldn't let me handle a knife, so
I worked the menial jobs in the kitchen.

185
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,610
Everyday, I diligently watched the Chef as he
made sushi so I could figure out his technique.

186
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,230
And I practiced his technique
for forming the rice.

187
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,060
Now finally, he's entrusted me
with a branch restaurant.

188
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,250
This time, I'm going to succeed.

189
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,180
Good for you, Chef Hasegawa!

A man should have a trade.

might come back now, eh?

cucumber rolls look!

Sure.

202
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,100
The next one is also a cucumber roll.

203
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,160
You're good at cucumber
rolls, Hasegawa-san.

204
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,290
I think that's what I'll have.

205
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,210
...Another one.

206
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,750
Oh well, cucumber rolls might be a good
way to get the stomach started.

So you're telling us that the story

219
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,860
about the Chef recognizing
your abilities was a lie...

220
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,960
and the truth is the Chef is in the hospital
and unable to come to the restaurant,

221
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,950
so he hired you, a part-timer, and
left you in charge of the place?

222
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,070
He said everything would be fine because
there was this sushi machine,

there's no way you can make sushi.

No one expects perfection at a

265

As long as there's a topping on top of a decently
formed rice ball, we'll be able to fool them.

Hasegawa-san, at the very least,

267
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,680
would you mind teaching
us how to form the rice?

268

Even if you know how to make
only cucumber rolls,

269
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,350
you did watch Chef make them, so
you know how it's done, right?

All right. It was monkey see, monkey
do, but watch closely.

271
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,200
First, you take the rice.

272
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,650
Be careful not to take too much.

273
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,170
Squeeze the rice not too
hard, and not too soft,

274
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,330
with one hand so that
air gets into the rice.

275
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,560
Put on the wasabi, then the
topping. And the sushi....

276
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,240
is done.

277
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,500
What the?!

278
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,360
How did that end up turning
into a cucumber roll?!

Something happened when
we switched scenes!

280
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,040
It's hopeless. I can only
make cucumber rolls.

You were so close just now.

282
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,900
You placed a slice of tuna on top.

283
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,580
How'd that change into a cucumber roll?!

roll is "water imp roll."]

I think I got the general idea.

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,530
I feel I can at least make something
that looks like sushi.

290
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,870
I agree. There's no heat involved, so
I'm sure even you could do it, Sis.

291
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,360
Shape it so air gets into the
grains and add the wasabi.

292
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,290
Place the topping, and give it
a squeeze. I did it. It's done.

293
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,850
What is that?!

294
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,910
Why is it burned to a crisp?!

295
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,760
When did you add heat?
What did you just do?

296
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,810
Actually, I've been a bit feverish
since yesterday.

297
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,040
How hot are you?! Go home!

298
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,980
Go to the hospital immediately!
For your lousy head!

299

You guys fail because you don't know

300
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,490
what you're doing and
you think too much.

301
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,180
You don't need masterful skill.

302
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,030
All we have to do is get the shape
right, even if it tastes bad.

303
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,210
See?

304
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,790
You get the shape right!

305
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,550
This isn't even sushi anymore!

306
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,280
Taste it before you complain. Will
you be able to, once you do?

307
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,520
I won't eat it! It has the look of
an entry in a pastry contest!

308
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,520
All right, we'll put Gin-san's parfait and
my toasted rice ball on the side menu.

309
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,240
That's not a toasted rice
ball. It's a burnt corpse.

That's awesome, Kagura-chan!
It's a perfect piece of sushi!

It's sushi no matter how you look at it!

316

This would be all right to serve in
the restaurant, don't you think?

317

No, it's too big.

Where did you get a slice
of tuna this huge?!

319

It's been my dream to
bite into a huge sushi.

320

You're not supposed to
make it for yourself.

321

Where in the world are you going to
find someone who can eat this?!

322
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,720
We have an order for
egg roll and shrimp!

323

What're we going to do?

324
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,030
We still don't have any finished
sushi except cucumber rolls.

We can't serve that!

Piccolo?! That's mostly vomit!

A robot does not vomit. I simply prepared
the sushi inside my body.

There's something gooey all over it!

338

That's oil.

This is no time for talk.

Regardless of how it was made,
this looks the most decent.

flavor I've never tasted before!

Thick and smooth, yet not overpowering!
What is this?!

348
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,440
It's a revolutionary new sushi!

This is incredible! The plates
are flying off the line!

There's a long line out front, too!

We did it! We've done it!

Toshi, what's with this place?

371
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,720
I came because I heard this was a conveyor
belt sushi restaurant, but...

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,900
the only things on the belt
are cucumber rolls.

and delicious. Was it bull?

374
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,490
The attitude of the staff is the worst.

375
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,900

going to tell them off.

Keep it chilled.

379
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,900
Hey, Toshi, what's that?
Could that be dark matter?

380
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,030
Why would dark matter be spinning on
the belt alongside cucumber rolls?

381
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,980
It's 300 yen. What should I do?
Should I take it, Toshi?

382
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,090
Never mind the dark matter.

Toshi, maybe that's your order.
