00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,520
Kyubei Yagyu took Otae away.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,780
In an effort to rescue her, the Odd Jobs trio,

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,790
led by Shinpachi, and three of the Shinsengumi, led by Kondo, challenged the Yagyu clan.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,560
But, the Four Aces of the Yagyu clan and their leader, Kyubei Yagyu, stand in their way.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,180
In order to take Otae back,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,070
they must take on the Yagyu in a six-on-six game of survival.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,840
Otae-san. Sandpaper.

Young Lord. Sandpaper.

10

Otae-san. Sandpaper..

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,660
Young Lord. Sandpaper.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,780
My duty is to protect the Young Lord and further his ambitions.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,990
I have done a very disrespectful thing to lead you to victory, Young Lord...

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,810
In the end, I...

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,950
...was weak.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,110
But the next time...

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,010
No, I could never use...the sandpaper.

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,140
Otae-san...I'm sorry...

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,480
I came this far to see your smiling face, but...

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,380
But this is as far as I got.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,060
I am such...a fool...

22

[Kondo and Tojo were eliminated after a fierce
battle. All that remains is a showdown between Gintoki and Binbokusai.]

[Meanwhile, as Hijikata battles Kyubei Yagyu, a certain suspicion lingers.]

24
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,450
How'd we end up like this?

25
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,960
How did we end up like this?

26
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,130
Jeez... I never should've come here.

27
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,380
To be honest, I wasn't really up for coming in the first place.

28
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,140
But the others said, let's go, so...

29
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,110
I didn't want to be a party pooper, but I got caught up in the heat of the moment.

30
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,950
I'm such a fool.

31
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,580
Same here.

32
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,380
Truth is, Kyubei...

33
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,160
insisted that I be the captain, so I had no choice.

34

[Note: Binbokusai is an avid junk collector. People's large junk collections is an actual problem in Japan.]

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,690
Recently, the bureaucrats have been making sinister attempts to try and tear down my trash mansion.

36
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,110
They're my real enemies.

37
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,320
This is ridiculous!

38
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,370
It's never wise to get swept up in other people's ideals, is it?

39
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,110
Frankly, I don't give a hoot who those youngsters marry.

40
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,700
Have it their way.

41
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,910
Who cares if the baby came first, or if they get divorced after the honeymoon?

42
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,770
Hey, more importantly, are you sure you don't have any paper?

43
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,120
Nothing.

44
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,190
Nothing that even sounds like paper.

45
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,450
How about you?

46

[Secrets of the Yagyu Chingkage Style]

47
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,280
Nope.

48
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,770
Nothing that even resembles paper.

49
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,910
Don't you...

50
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,510
cheat, now.

51
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,970
Seriously, if you do find paper, share it, okay?

52
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,480
Naturally.

53
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,170
Don't you go cheating either.

54
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,210
[Note: This is a pun because the words for "god" and "paper" are homonyms in Japanese.]

55
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,640
Swear to god.

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,210
You swear it too.

57
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,880
If you break it, you have to kill yourself.

58
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,320
You'll have to kill yourself too.

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,850
If you don't, I get to flick your forehead ten times.

60
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,380
Are you wiping?

61
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,800
It sounds like it.

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
You have paper, don't you?

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
I told you, I don't have any.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Friends shouldn't doubt each other.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,790
Is that a wiping sound I hear?

66
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,910
You have paper, don't you?

67
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,740
No, I don't.

68
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,310
But what about you?

69
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,830
I keep telling you...

70
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,670
I don't have any!!

You're panting.

73
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,130
Letting your opponent see you breathing hard...

74
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,060
is a sign of weakness!

75
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,870
Are you mocking me?

76
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,130
But you're not only breathing hard.

77
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,350
There's hesitation in your strikes.

78
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,560
Do you think you can win against me like that?

79
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,120
What're you playing at?

80

What am I playing at?

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,790
Give me a break!

82
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,390
I should ask you the same thing.

83
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,100
If my intuition is correct...

84
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,640
No, it's not an intuition...

85

The very first time we crossed swords, something didn't seem right.

86
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,370
Now, I'm positive...

87

If I'm right...then what is this fight really about?

88

Don't hesitate.

89

Regardless of who the opponent is...

I'm trying to get a clean shot at your plate.

You're going to get hurt if you keep moving.

94

You see things pretty clearly with those dead-fish eyes.

95

Is that your own sword style?

Quiet!

103

I'm never ever going to listen to anything you say again!

104

You came here to be a bride without telling me anything!

105
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,460
That gives me the right to take you back the same way!

Shin-chan... I apologize for not saying anything to you.

113

But don't do this.

114
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,350
If you pull any more crazy stunts against the Yagyu, you'll get hurt.

115
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,860
And besides...I've already made up my mind.

116
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,100
That's not fair, Sis.

117
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,740
You always show your smiling face, but you never show your true feelings.

118
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,800
Even when it hurts or you feel like crying, you force yourself to smile.

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,520
You never tell anyone how you feel.

120
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,010
You keep it to yourself,

121
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,860
make up your mind by yourself and leave by yourself with a smile on your face.

122
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,570
Stop putting up a front!

123
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,900
If something is troubling you, please tell us!

124

I won't let you say that I'm alone in this!

125
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,510
Everyone came here because we saw the sadness in your face.

126
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,950
They'd die before admitting it, but they're doing all this for you.

Please remember, we are here for you.

when you're unhappy.

130
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,930
This is none of their business.

131
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,300
I never asked them to come here.

132
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,380
Just leave me alone already.

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,330
I dare you to say that again, dammit!

134
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,830
I'll say it as many times as you want!

135
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,150
I...

136
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,940
I wish I could stay with all of you forever too!

137
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,790
But, I can't...

138
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,650
I have to be Kyu-chan's left eye!

139
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,140
Left eye?

140
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,820
Sis, what do you mean?

141
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,350
Otae-chan, are you still hung up about that?

142
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,700
Hijikata-san...

143
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,120
Shinpachi-kun.

144
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,730
You may not know this, but when I was young, I lost my left eye.

145
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,820
Otae-chan happened to be there.

146
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,020
I told her not to feel responsible.

147
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,720
On the contrary, I'm actually grateful.

148
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,200
Because that incident made me the person I am today.

149
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,560
In exchange for my left eye, I gained strength.

150
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,500
Shinpachi-kun, how many in your team are left?

151
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,390
No, it doesn't matter how many are left.

152
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,430
If I defeat you, their captain, it's all over.

153
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,500
I will have your precious sister.

154
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,510
Have her?

155
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,370
Don't talk nonsense!

156
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,940
Hey, four-eyes.

157
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,950
We've all been duped. This whole thing is a farce.

158
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,150
He's...a woman.

159
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,670
A...woman?

160
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,270
Kyubei-san's a woman?

161
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,720
What's going on?!

162
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,540
I mean she's got what you don't, and missing what you've got.

163

But...he says he's going to marry Sis...

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,990
That can't be!

165
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,520
No way.

166
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,500
Could it be...?

167
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,720
Do you...

168
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,100
think Sis is a man?!

169
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,350
She is kind of flat-chested, but...

170
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,810
Of course not!

171
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,270
Kyu-chan has the body of a woman, but the heart of a man.

172
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,710
He can only love women.

173
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,780
They say anyone who interferes with love deserves to be kicked to death by a horse.

174
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:24,040
It's not nice to interfere with a couple who've vowed to become husband and wife.

175
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,180
Husband and wife?

176
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,750
Don't make me laugh, old man.

177
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,530
Your Young Lord is actually your Young Princess, right?

178
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm surprised.

179
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,900
You knew?

180
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,270
You can fool the others, but you can't fool my crotch sensor.

181
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,120
My sensor went bad a long time ago.

182
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,550
The other day, it responded to a slipper.

183
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,970
I felt like killing myself.

184
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,300
Just what I'd expect of the powerful Yagyu.

185
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,890
It makes no difference if it's a slipper or a woman.

186
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,620
Are you planning to put the entire Yagyu clan up to the task of wedding two women?

187
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,110
That's bullshit!

188
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,400
Do you really think anyone will accept that?!

189
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,580
Sis!

190
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,330
Why didn't you say something all this time?!

191
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,580
You knew, didn't you?

192
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,850
Or...

193
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,350
you knew and you were still willing to marry Kyubei?

194
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,400
It's totally our fault she grew up that way.

195
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,430
For generations, it is tradition for the reigns of the Yagyu clan to be passed to a male heir.

196
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:30,200
However, my son Koshinori's wife died shortly after giving birth the Kyubei.

197
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,360
There were suggestions from the clan that he find a new wife,

198
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,200
but Koshinori never agreed.

199
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,120
If he had and his new wife bore a child,

200
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,550
Kyubei would've lost her position in the Yagyu clan.

201
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,330
My son and I thought of ways to help her.

202
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,240
You call yourself a boy?

203
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,570
You call yourself a samurai?!

204
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,150
But...I'm a girl...

205
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,100
You're not a girl!

206
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,490
Except to a very select few in the Yagyu clan,

207
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,510
You're a boy! A boy!

208
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,160
we kept the fact that Kyubei was a girl a secret and raised her as a boy.

209
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,850
But Father...

210
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,700
Not "Father"!

211
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,160
Call me "Papa"!

212
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,310
Of course, we had no intention of actually turning her into a real man.

213
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,760
[Become strong, Kyubei!]

214
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,660
[You're a boy!]

215
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:22,010
But in order for Kyubei to take over the Yagyu clan, she needed to be strong.

216
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,530
[The Yagyu clan is on your shoulders!]

217
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,970
[You call yourself a samurai?!]

218
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,000
[Kyubei, become stronger!]

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,540
[Boys don't cry!]

220
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,240
[Don't think of yourself as a girl!]

221
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,300
[Call me Papa!]

222
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,540
[Gramps is against it!]
[Quiet!]
[Don't act so spoiled!]
[I told you not to bring home junk!]

223
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,940
Sissy!

224
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,960
Girly boy!

225
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,460
This wuss is always crying.

226
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,050
Do you really have a ding-dong?

227
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,230
Let's take off his hakama and check!

228
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,660
At first, it may've been nothing more than admiration.

229
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,090
She was a girl, just like me, but she was so strong.

230
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,280
So what if you're small.

231
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,330
If you're shorter than everyone else,

232
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,950
you should become a samurai who has a bigger heart than everyone else.

233
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,120
Then, Tae-chan... If I become a strong samurai with a big heart,

234
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,860
will you be the balls between my legs?

235
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,960
That's impossible.

236
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,160
Kyu-chan, you're a samurai, but you don't have any balls between your legs.

237
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,610
They'll grow in.

238
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,060
Grandpa said so.

239
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,580
They won't grow in.

240
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,330
But a kind of shrubbery will.

241
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,170
I'll go to Morocco to grow some!

242
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,510
If you grow some, let me see them, okay?

243
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,620
She's a very strong girl...

244
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,310
But eventually I realized... She was hiding something behind her smile.

245
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,550
Damn kid!

246
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,160
Shin-chan!

247
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,290
You're one smart-aleck kid who can't pay back the money you borrowed.

248
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,510
What do you say?

249
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,410
Shall I sell you off to another planet?

250
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,020
Earthling kids learn new skills quickly, so we could sell him for a good price.

251
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,160
Stop it!

252
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,920
Don't touch my brother!

253
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,000
Shut up!

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,280
The two of you have no...

255
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,370
I wanted to protect her.

256
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,330
Kyu-chan...

257
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,890
Kyu-chan...are you all right?

258
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,970
Tae-chan...

259
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,930
I...can never become a man, no matter what I do.

260
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,090
But I'll...

261
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,710
become stronger than any man or woman, for you, Otae-chan...

262
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,580
and I'll protect you, I promise.

263
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,490
Forgive me, Kyu-chan... I'm so sorry...

264
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,490
I will be your left eye.

265
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,730
We're attracted to each other by something that transcends gender-something more pure.

266
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,280
I will keep the promise I made long ago.

267
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,380
I am the one who should be by Otae-chan's side.

268
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,200
Otae-chan said it didn't bother her, but she probably felt she owed him.

269
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,270
That can't be helped.

270
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:33,360
Kyubei needs Otae-chan, and Otae-chan wants to support Kyubei.

271
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,930
They may both be women, but they do share a kind of love.

272
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,790
You cannot defeat me because you're crippled by your own definitions of gender.

273
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,040
Take this man.

274
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,550
He lost his edge the moment he realized I was a woman.

275
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,550
How can someone so weak-spirited protect what's important to him?

276
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,460
They say the path of love is a rocky one,

277
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,550
but the path those two tread is strewn with boulders.

278
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,390
We're the ones who set them on that path.

279
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,590
It's our job to see it through to the end.

280
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,530
Don't go...

281
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,360
mouthing off...

282
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,570
selfish...excuses!!

283
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,740
"She was hiding something behind her smile"?!

284
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,940
If you knew that...

285
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,180
why can't you see she's hiding something from you right now?!

286
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,680
A kind of love?

287
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,930
Don't go saying such sick things...

288
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,370
without even trying to understand how the other person feels!

289
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,620
"An attraction that transcends gender," you say?!

290
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,820
I don't give a damn, you fool!

291
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,390
Someone who makes his or her beloved cry...

292
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,260
isn't a man or a woman!!

293
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,900
It's called a jerk!!

294
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
Idiot!

295
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,910
That's why I hate guys who can't get girls!

296
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,430
Right, Gin-san?

297
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,080
Absolutely, Shinpachi-kun.

298
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,700
I won't let you sully the name of the Yagyu clan any further!

299
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,320
Get them!

300
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,220
Outta my way!!

301
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,830
I won't let you interfere with a duel between two men...er, a man and a woman...between samurai!

302
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,670
I, Isao Gorilla, will not allow it!

303
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,830
Kondo-san!

304
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,430
Boss, I can only last five minutes max on one leg.

305
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,250
So please hurry it up!

306
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,160
Why am I your horse?!

307
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Big Sis, men are unreliable, so I came to help!

308
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,700
China girl!

309
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,880
Don't steal my thunder!

310
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,760
There are only four of them! What's the problem?!

311
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,450
I can't see...

312
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,190
Shinpachi!

313
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,380
Open your eyes!

314
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,120
Easy for you to say...

315
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,100
I want to go back...

316
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,690
I...

317
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,000
want to go back to everyone.

318
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,860
Don't move!

319
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,610
Gin-san!

320
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,170
Funny isn't it, Shinpachi-kun?

321
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,590
To think that you're the one holding back your team.

322
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:17,780
You must've known...that in the end, someone was going to rescue you.

323
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,140
That's why you took on a fight you had no chance of winning.

324
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,260
You've always been like that.

325
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,470
You've always hidden behind others-protected.

326
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,010
But you never try to understand the feelings of the people who are protecting you.

327
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,090
Do you know why Tae-chan developed that fake smile?

328
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,730
It's because you are weak!

329
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,970
If I had been by Tae-chan's side, this would never have happened!

330
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,490
Gin-san...

331
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,380
I'm the only one who can protect her.

332
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,510
Don't talk as if you know.

333
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,740
What do you know about this guy?!

334
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,680
I don't want to hear someone like you bad-mouthing...my friend!

335
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,590
Shinpachi!

336
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,090
Your captain is finished.

337
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,410
It's over.

338
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,410
Old man.

339
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,340
Your grandchild doesn't seem to realize that...

340
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,930
people have been protecting her, her whole life.

341
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,470
Where's...

342
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,430
your wooden sword?

343
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,940
Uh-oh...

344
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,400
Where could it have gone?

345
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,140
Kyubei?!

346
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,570
Ahh...I finally found them.

347
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,780
Shinpachi.

348
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,100
You can see clearly now, right?

349
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,870
What you're fighting to protect?

350
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,060
What's important?

351
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,190
I can see just fine now!
