00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,490
Nothing really.

159
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,100
It's what Agomi wanted. So we're
just giving him a supportive push.

160
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,980
But you do know, right?

161
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,860
In the end, Agomi's love won't
ever be reciprocated.

162
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,880
Besides, he's an ordinary host,
especially around them.

163
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,200
If you do something unnecessary, and
it hurts him, what are you going to do?

164
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,990
Don't tell me you think things
will work out between them.

165
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,500
No need to worry.

166
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,730
It's like Agomi is more a young girl
in love than a real girl right now.

167
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,350
Just looking at a man from a
distance gives him a fantasy.

168
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,500
But men in the real world
are always nasty.

169
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,240
And not only in the way
they treat woman...

170
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,250
...but also in their lifestyle, the
way they smell, everything.

171
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,560
If Agomi finds out about their real lives,
his fantasies will be crushed.

172
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,990
Then she'll...

173
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,510
...realize that she has to move
on for the sake of tomorrow.

174
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,490
Gin-san...

175
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,310
No!

176
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,350
This is...

177
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,580
This is...

178
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,810
...Jurota-kun's...

179
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,970
...smell!

180
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,020
Is this Jurota-kun's locker?

181
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,200
Oh, yes! Oh, sweet!

182
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,770
What's this? Nice smell! Oh, no! I'm
going up! I'm rising to heaven!

183
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,690
It's not like that!

184
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,860
Well, see you later!

185
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,480
Wow! Great!

186
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,660
Agonosuke-san must be working
really hard to clean up!

187
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,620
A-Agonosuke-san...

188
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,440
That's right... You found out...

189
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,000
And so I might as well...

190
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,890
It looks like Agomi-san quit the
club after disgracing himself.

191
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,190
It ended up being his hopeless love.

192
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,350
Serious feelings sometimes have
a cruel ending, you know.

193
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,480
But Agomi will move on for the
sake of a new tomorrow.

194
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,630
Thanks for waiting!

195
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,650
Oh, no! I didn't wait at all.

196
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,640
Well, let's go!

197
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,910
Yeah, Azumi-san.

198
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,850
Gin-san...What's...that?

199
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,940
Well, you know... He moved on for
the sake of a new tomorrow...

200
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,040
...with Jurota-kun.

201
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,020
What the...?!

202
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,830
It's raining today, too...

203
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,330
When rainy days come so often,
it makes my heart gloomy as well.

204
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,490
Rainy day, rainy day, more rainy days...
It makes my brain moldy, too.

205
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,840
It was already like that.

206
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,060
How many days have
we not seen the sun?

207
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,890
It looks like mushrooms are
growing on my crotch.

208
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,450
It was already like that.

209
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,610
There are no clients. I don't feel
like going out in the rain.

210
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,700
There's no money.

211
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,120
Sadaharu stinks and my feet stink,
too, and so does Shinpachi.

212
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,700
What do you mean, "so does Shinpachi"?
Don't compare me to your feet.

213
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,400
Why are you two being
so negative? Cheer up!

214
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,880
The rainy season will be over soon.

215
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,590
Then you can get as much
sunlight as you want.

216
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,000
...That's why I hate the rainy season.

217
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,210
I'm kind of dubious about the
name "Tsuyu," anyway.

218
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,210
[Note: Tsuyu means rainy season.]

219
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,040
Just hearing to it makes me feel down.

220
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,140
Just listening to it makes me feel down.

221
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,950
It can't be helped because
it's the rainy season.

222
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,750
Why don't we call it by a different name?

223
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,330
Something with a more exhilarating tone.

224
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,400
How about "Happy Birthday To You?"

225
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,400
[Note: Japanese pronounce "to you"
like tsu-yu. Tsuyu = rainy season.]

226
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,960
...Isn't that a little long?

227
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,040
[Note: Kagura refers to the day
of a girl's menstrual period.]

228
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,040
It's too difficult to say.
I prefer "Girl's Day."

229
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,670
No, that sounds like a different day.

230
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,990
That's even more difficult to say.

231
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,960
And it's not even an appropriate word
for a show in this timeslot.

232
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,310
Then let's adopt the middle viewpoint
and call it "Independence Day."

233
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,650
Why is that the middle?

234
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,220
From now on, call "Tsuyu"
"Independence Day."

235
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:34,220
Anyway...well... "Independence Day"
will be over soon, so let's cheer up!

236
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,680
Man, I really hate "Tsuyu"!

237
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,060
I don't feel like doing anything.

238
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,440
...Huh? Aren't you going to
use "Independence Day"?

239
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,760
I felt a bit embarrassed saying that.

240
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,450
Huh? Shinpachi-kun, did you just say
"Indepen...something"? What's that?

241
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,810
No-No, I didn't... I didn't
say that! What's that?!

242
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,830
Yeah, you just said it. "Indepen...something."

243
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,870
Isn't it popular right now?
Is it something cool?

244
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,890
I didn't say that! I don't
even know what it is!

245
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,060
You guys are too noisy!

246
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,820
Stop annoying me and just shut up!

247
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,140
Who do think is the most
annoying person?

248
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,590
You guys are just taking
your stress out on me!

249
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,510
Not really. I don't take
my stress out on you.

250
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,230
I'm not annoying at all, either.

251
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,690
Don't talk! I'm so annoyed
listening to you guys talk!

252
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,660
You're the one who shouldn't
be talking! What's that?

253
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,570
Those mini gongs on your head! There's
something ugly on your head!

254
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,820
Oh? Why do you wear only
one sleeve of that robe?!

255
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,140
Why don't you wear it properly?!

256
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,570
Good grief! I give up! I don't care
about you guys anymore!

257
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,280
Shut up!

258
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,420
Shut up, Four-eyes!

259
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,980

Your Umbrella and Hate Yourself For It"]

Why do I have to go out with you
guys on such a rainy day?

262
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,850
When we stay in the house and
brood, we get depressed.

263
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,140
We should go out at such times.

264
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,470
And this isn't so bad, you know.

265

For example, look! Here come some
girls walking with umbrellas.

268
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,670
Aren't they pure and beautiful?

269
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,320
We see girls with umbrellas
all throughout the year.

270
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,710
And girls with wet see-through

00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,710

What's with her?

280
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,360
Just leave her alone.

281
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,310
Brats like rain, storms, typhoons
and all that kind of stuff.

Wow, nice umbrella, Gin-san.
It looks cool and chic.

man uses it! I can take it if you like.

That's all right. It's all right

You have such a cool umbrella.

Would you mind letting us under it?
Because ours broke.

Boy, "Independence Day" makes me feel
really gloomy. That's why I hate it.

314
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,510
No, I think "Independence
Day" isn't all that bad.
