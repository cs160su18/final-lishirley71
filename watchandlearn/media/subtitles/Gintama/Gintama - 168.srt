Can't you tell?

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,920
It's a "resurrection spell," okay?

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,350
We're picking up where we
left off last week, right?

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,520
So we need one.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,490
Why?!

10
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,170
Why do we need a "resurrection spell" for an
anime flashback of the previous episode?!

Nobody uses a password system
in this day and age!

at the end of last week's episode!

You're so useless.

16

Then I'll just enter something random.

17
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,050
Uh, I'm pretty sure it's a bad
idea to put in random stuff.

A brand-new virus that infects the program,
consumes it, and multiplies.

Once it infected Tama, who
is a highly advanced robot,

I play an RPG.

92

It's a waste to rush through everything.

106

It's important to prepare well before setting
out on an adventure in an RPG.

107
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,110
Don't blame me if you leave the safe town
and run into a really strong enemy.

108
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,000
Now confess what you've
done before God.

Shinpachi's the type who always
rests up at an inn before saving?

115

You people are the sticklers! Who
bothers to save at this point?!

We have no idea if these guys
are allies or enemies.

I apologize for taking so long.

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,330

There is no problem.

143
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,780
I cannot lie around shamelessly while
everyone else is fighting for my sake.

144
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,520
Er, sorry about that...

145
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,440
We've only been to the casino, so we
haven't actually done any fighting.

146
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,050
I shall redirect the remaining operational
systems to support you.

147
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,210
Does that include these guys?!

148
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,610
Yes, they are components of the original
security system in my body.

Security?! These men in bodysuits?!

151
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,880
Their job is to expel the viruses
that infiltrate my body.

152
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,050
And as they protect me, they've also
built a home inside my body.

153
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,800
Protect you...?

154
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,480
Are they actually protecting you?

155
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,000
It looks more like they're pretending
to be in Dragon Quest.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,170
There is no problem.

157
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,960
Their program has been rewritten to recognize
you as saviors from another world.

158
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,070
They should all assist you
in destroying the viruses.

159
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,900
We should start by meeting with the Leukocyte
King and asking for his aid.

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,710
It will be impossible to defeat
the Tapir without it.

161
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,740
Oh, yeah.

162
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,630
Now that you mention it, we were asked
to deliver a message to the king.

163
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,490
It saddens me to say that our Leukocyte
army has fallen to the Virus army.

164
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,330
I pray that our king takes flight.

165
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,820
And searches for the legendary
warriors from another world...

166
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,780
Search for the midgets...

167
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,530
Let's go, Gin-san.

168
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,750
Tonnelat, how could you die on me?

169
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,750
[Note: Character name from Dragon Quest.]

170
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,230
No, he isn't dead.

171
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,540
Don't kill him off like that.

172
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,150
And Tonnelat is one lame name.

173
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,830
Tonnelat only needed 1,008 love experience
points to reach the next level.

174
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,320
What are love experience points?

175
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,600
How many times does a girl have to fail
at love before she grows stronger?

176
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,520
And who's Tonnelat?

177
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,460
[Note: Fictional name from Dragon Quest.]

178
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,460
Suke-san needs 5,466 more
summer experience points.

179
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,220
What the hell?!

180
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,810
How many summers has
he been through?!

181
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,380
And why Suke-san?!

182
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,810
Would you like to learn the
resurrection spell for love?

183
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,640
Only weak men would
be interested in that.

184
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,030
Women are always looking
forward to their next love!

185
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,690
When did this game turn
into a romance RPG?

186
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,150
Are you completely influenced
by your memories of love?!

187
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,730
Ow! Ow!

188
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,970
Her parting words are piercing my heart!

189
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,780
Like I care!

190
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,240
What did you say?!

191
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,630
You mean our Leukocyte army was
defeated by the Virus army?!

192
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,370
Yes.

193
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,510
That was the last message
from the injured soldier.

194
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,750
He wished for Your Majesty to escape before
your foes reached your kingdom.

195
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,090
But running away from love
will only lead to regret.

196
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,020
Can you drop the crap
about love already?!

197
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,780
Are you a sophomore in high
school or something?!

198
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,370
Escape and abandon the leukocytes who've
been injured while fighting for this kingdom?

199
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,580
How could I do such a thing?

200
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,090
Travelers...

201
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,400
A legend has been passed down
in this kingdom from olden days.

202
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,580
When a great disaster befalls this land,

203
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,260
heroes carrying toothpicks will travel from
another world to save our world!

204
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,770
Perhaps you all are...

205
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,600
No, I say no more.

206
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,600
How could I ask someone else to fight for the sake
of a kingdom on the verge of destruction?!

207
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,390
Except you just said that out loud.

208
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,590
This old man's got no shame, and I'm
not just talking about the bodysuit.

209
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,520
Hey, you're pretty slow, old Spe**.

210
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,180
[Note: Bleep covers "sperm."]

211
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,240
Enough introductions. Just hand
over your remaining soldiers.

212
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,390
And give us whatever's in your treasure
vault for our war chest.

213
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,480
We sound more like thieves than heroes.

214
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,210
Amazing.

215
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,390
Are you offering to fight on our side?

216
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,440
My eyes did not betray me!

217
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,290
You must be the heroic
midgets of legend!

218
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,450
But our kingdom has suffered from the long
war and we have no soldiers to offer you.

219
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,100
Don't give me that bull!

220
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,530
There are two guards here, plus you!

221
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,710
I'll abuse you like a workhorse.

222
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,550
Hey! Stop that, Gin-san!

223
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,580
I shall offer one of the
strongest soldiers of the

224
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,550
Leukocyte Kingdom to aid
you in your journey.

225
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,230
Really?

226
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,170
Come forth!

227
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,490
The strongest pair around, feared
as the Leukocyte Double Dragon!

228
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,760
[Note: Parody of Ortega and Despisaro
from Dragon Quest III.]

229
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,770
The warrior, Bortega!

230
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,760
The fighter, Despigaro!

231
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,900
Take whichever one you want.

232
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,870
We don't want either of them!

233
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,840
Hey!

234
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,780
How can you call them Double Dragon?!

235
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,380
How can you call them
the strongest pair?!

236
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,650
Why is there someone who looks like
the prince crying behind Bortega?!

237
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,650
You're obviously trying to get
rid of a dog the prince took in!

238
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,410
Are you taking it...?

239
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,470
We aren't! We aren't taking it!

240
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,620
So you don't want Bortega...

241
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,980
Then take Moth-

242
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,020
I mean, Despigaro

243
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,870
Mother?!

244
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,410
You were about to say "Mother"!

245
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,240
You called Despigaro "Mother"!

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,460
Hey, you've got some nerve, old man.

247
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,160
You trying to ditch your mother
off on the party of heroes

248
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,510
because you don't want
to take care of her?

249
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,650
Unbelievable. He's worse
than those viruses.

250
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,870
We should eliminate him first.

251
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,010
Wait! Wait! Wait!

252
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,880
No! No!

253
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,060
That's wrong! You've got it all wrong!

254
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,130
Give me a break, big guy.

255
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,880
You know how people accidentally call
their teacher "Mother" sometimes?

256
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,530
That's what it was! For real!

257
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,810
You're not even acting
like a king anymore.

258
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,030
More like a common thug!

259
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,760
It's true that I've been fighting with my
wife about how to take care of Mother.

260
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,680
It's true there was an uproar because
Takeshi brought home a mutt.

261
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,110
But none of that has anything to do
with what we're discussing here!

262
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,390
Except it does.

263
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,960
It's obviously related!

264
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,410
You're obviously trying to dump
your problems off on us!

265
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,100
No! You're wrong!

266
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,900
These two, you see...

267
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,780
They may look like this now,

268
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,340
but that's because they were
cursed by the virus!

269
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,490
If you can find the Poof Mirror
that reveals the truth,

270
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:44,060
[Note: Parody of Rah Mirror
from Dragon Quest series.]

271
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,150
they'll return to their original
forms and serve you well!

272
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,190
Very well! Please give it a try!

273
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,810
What's this Poof Mirror crap?

274
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,800
Your head's gone poof!

275
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
No! I'm serious!

276
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,650
If you had the Poof Mirror!

277
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,410
I could show you!

278
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,360
We have it.

279
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,630
The Poof Mirror is right here.

280
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,330
What?

281
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,110
Where did you get that...?

282
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,780
We are inside my body.

283
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,460
Searching for an object is like
going through my pockets.

284
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,620
I've heard the Tapir are especially
skilled at mimicry.

285
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,460
You cannot defeat the Tapir if you
believe everything you see.

286
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,120
Now, let us see what truths
shall be revealed,

287
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,260
be it Bortega, Despigaro,
or something else...

288
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,410
Everybody look closely.

289
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,160
Th-This is...!

290
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,090
The King... The King...!

291
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,720
His nipples...are huge!

292
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,130
Nobody cares! I swear!

293
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,120
No! Wait a sec!

294
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,320
The King's nipples ARE getting bigger!

295
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,250
Yo** **o...

296
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,250
[Note: Word play on "Oh no."
Bleep covers "Yoko Ono."]

297
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,790
No, even bigger!

298
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,520
This is... This is...!

299
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,060
Not too shabby.

300
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
[Leukocyte]

301
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,720
[Tapir]

302
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,470
[Leukocyte]

303
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,940
[Tapir]

304
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,870
Not too shabby.

305
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,420
I never expected you to see
through this Tapir disguise!

306
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,170
This is...

307
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,980
Hey! Don't tell me this is a Tapir!

308
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,110
He's just wearing a black bodysuit
instead of a white one!

309
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,040
This isn't the time for that!

310
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,950
If they've already gotten the Leukocyte
King, that means...

311
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,120
Exactly.

312
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,120
You came to this kingdom seeking aid,

313
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,000
but are too late.

314
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The Leukocyte Kingdom, from
the king down to the soldiers...

315
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,170
Even Mother...

316
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,520
Even Prince Takeshi...

317
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,930
The entire kingdom is in black bodysuits!

318
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,580
You have no allies here!

319
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,000
We will consume all!

320
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,480
Until all are dressed in black bodysuits,

321
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,550
we will continue to consume!

322
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,430
The toothpicks.

323
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,380
Everyone take hold of your toothpicks!

324
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,560
Those toothpicks were specially
made by Gengai-sama.

325
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,510
They take advantage of the Tapir's
nature to consume data

326
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,820
by sending large quantities
of data at high speeds!

327
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,500
Huh? What?

328
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,960
And the data is rotten enough
to cause food poisoning.

329
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,820
If you continue to send poison to their stomachs
after they've been poisoned once,

330
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,940
their stomachs will not have enough
time to digest the data

331
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,920
and they'll explode.

332
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,430
That sounds just fine!

333
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,860
These toothpicks can't remove leftover
food stuck in your teeth,

334
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,630
but they can kick stinking
virus butt, huh?!

335
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,890
Gin-san! There are too many!

336
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,200
We can't deal with all of them!

337
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,230
Hurry! This way!

338
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,560
We need to retreat for now!

339
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,370
Don't expect to escape!

340
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,220
You're all going to die here!

341
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,810
What are you...?!

342
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,370
This is...!

343
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,390
Poof Mirror, reveal the truth!

344
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,960
Return the sword to the hero who
protects me as no other can!

345
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,850
That's...!

346
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,980
The dog is...!

347
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,150
Turning into a person...

348
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,890
Y-You're...!

349
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,370
That is not a person.

350
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,540
That is...

351
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,820
The ultimate security program that
has destroyed many viruses

352
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,860
and kept the peace in my body.

353
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,140
The one and only true...

354
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,810
Leukocyte King!

355
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,240
Gi...

356
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,310
Gin-san?!

357
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,410
Find them!

358
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,110
Were they there?

359
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,180
Where'd they go?!

360
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,590
Damn! Where did they go?

361
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,330
Find them! Even if you have
to split nose hairs!

362
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,470
Looks like they're gone.

363
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,540
Lady Tama, they will find us here.

364
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,830
We should move at once.

365
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,910
I believe B-29 in the large
intestine would be safe.

366
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,370
That place is a maze.

367
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,970
Perfect for hiding out in.

368
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,580
Leukocyte King, we did not
come here to escape.

369
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,720
We came to fight.

370
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,940
Though you may only be a copy,

371
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,720
I cannot allow Lady Tama
near those filthy viruses.

372
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,820
I can handle the fighting alone.

373
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,120
Leukocyte King.

374
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,590
This time we are up against
the strongest virus ever.

375
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,140
The battle will not be as simple
as it has been in the past.

376
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,810
Even someone as accomplished as
yourself will have no chance alone.

377
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,230
We must work together and fight.

378
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:35,220
So you were the one who rewrote my
program and turned me into that dog.

379
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,790
You restricted my ability to act so I wouldn't
attempt to face them alone.

380
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,360
Is that correct?

381
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,640
Your death would be an inconvenience.

382
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,090
When the right time finally came...

383
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,920
Yes, I wished for you to survive
to fight alongside us.

384
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,890
What's your problem?

385
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,590
Keep that virus-infested face
away from Lady Tama.

386
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,170
You wanna get sterilized?

387
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,700
No, sorry.

388
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,780
I couldn't help but stare at
such a handsome face...

389
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,390
Not!

390
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,310
I don't recall ever having a Transform
spell cast on me.

391
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,790
You've got nerve to do that embarrassing
cosplay with my face!

392
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,270
You think you're Loto?!

393
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,940
[Note: Loto is the legendary hero from Dragon Quest 3.]

394
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,340
A lot of people in this world claim
that DQ3 was the best one,

395
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,930
but I won't accept that!

396
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,080
There are two Gin-chans.

397
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,540
Ta-Tama-san, what is that?

398
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,150
Why does that guy look like Gin-san?

399
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,230
All internal systems are affected
by my memory banks,

400
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,170
thought patterns, and various other data.

401
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,540
I would assume that image
was influenced by my mind.

402
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,500
Meaning...?

403
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,140
The security program Leukocyte, which
combats all sorts of viruses,

404
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,720
is a reflection of the strongest
person I know.

405
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,700
That would be the most
accurate conclusion.

406
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,040
Hey!

407
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,080
Two of the strongest have
been assembled.

408
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,800
There is nothing to fear now.

409
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,850
I see. So you're my...

410
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,450
Though the significant difference
in personality between us

411
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,550
suggests she doesn't think much
of what's in your head.

412
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,920
What was that?!

413
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,570
Though that's a given, considering
how much of a coward you are.

414
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,310
You won't be able to protect Lady Tama
with those virus-infested hands.

415
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,610
I shall be the one to defeat the Tapir.

416
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,200
There is no need for you to step in.

417
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,630
I am the only one who can
protect Lady Tama.

418
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,970
[To Be Continued]

419
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,970
[The next episode...]

420
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,560
My lord, Archfiend Tapir.

421
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,370
I just received word that Bifidus Castle
and E. coli Castle have been taken.

422
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,420
Is that so?

423
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:34,610
The areas of greatest resistance
now belong to our forces.

424
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:41,480
Very soon, the system of this world
will fall completely into Tapir hands.

425
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,880
The super science and technology poured
into this robot meant nothing.

426
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,670
Nothing can stop us now.

427
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,850
Excellency!

428
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,090
What is all the fuss about?

429
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,040
The third Tapir general was somehow
destroyed in the Leukocyte Kingdom.

430
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,020
What? That's impossible.

431
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,050
The Leukocyte Kingdom was
completely under our control

432
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,470
without a single Leukocyte left to resist.

433
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,480
Nobody left in this world
can stand against us.

434
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,740
According to our information,

435
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,420
there was an incredibly strong Leukocyte
dressed up like he was in Dragon Quest.

436
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,030
Along with three human-like creatures
carrying toothpicks

437
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,140
and a pixel robot to fill out the party.

438
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,280
D-Dragon Quest, you say?!

439
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,320
C-Could it be?!

440
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,660
He's... He's still alive?!

441
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,520
Deliver this order to all soldiers
in this robot!

442
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,800
Return to the Archfiend
Tapir's castle at once!

443
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,080
Abandon any conquered
castles if necessary!

444
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,400
Concentrate all forces at his castle immediately
and tighten the defenses!

445
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,110
Sir!

446
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,030
Is it him?

447
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,670
Yes...

448
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,260
He's coming...

449
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,950
The Leukocyte King,

450
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,860
with a party of heroes from the outside
world, is headed towards this castle!

451
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,980
["A Group of Fools are Led"]

452
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,730
[The five fools are led to and storm
the Archfiend Tapir's castle!]

453
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,900
[Will Gin-san and the Leukocyte King
work well with one another?]

454
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,230
[See you next time.]
