2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,650
Go home.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,440
The Earth's too small for you, after all.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,390
I think we can all see that now. Go home with your father.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,440
Let's make this good-bye.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,180
What? Why? Why are you saying that?

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,750
I'm never going back...

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,200
I'll stay...forever...with you and the others...

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,940
Wait...

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,860
Stop it!

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,340
Think about it. This isn't where you belong, is it?

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,690
Why...?

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,310
Why...?

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,490
Why...?

15
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,090
[Umibozu, Kagura's father, visited Earth to retrieve his daughter.]

16
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,060
[Gintoki fired Kagura and she has decided to leave the Earth.]

17
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:40,070
["You Can't Judge a Movie by Its Title"]

18
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,490
Young lady, what're you doing in a place like this?

19
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,710
Why don't you come with us?

20
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,180
We take good care of little girls like you.

21
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,040
We'll even sell you to new parents! We're very kind men, you know.

22
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,380
Young lady...

23
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,590
Young lady, what're you doing in a place like this?

24
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,820
And without your umbrella on a day like this.

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,480
It's raining today, so I don't need it.

26
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,550
Don't be ridiculous. Umbrellas are supposed to be for rainy days.

27
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,170
If I opened my umbrella on a rainy day, I'd never be able to see the sky.

28
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,550
I want to see the sky, even if it's raining.

29
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,210
Hmm... You'll catch cold.

30
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,650
Pappy!

31
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,480
It was a dreary city of constant rain...

32
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,310
That was our home.

33
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,980
A place where only the unscrupulous could survive.

34
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,740
Others may have seen it as a sewer canal of a place,

35
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,370
but it was a great place to live for sewer rats.

36
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,330
Pappy, when will you come home next?

37
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,970
I just got home and you're already asking me that?

38
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,910
Don't leave anymore, Pappy.

39
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,410
I don't want to see Mommy so sad anymore.

40
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,030
Big brother doesn't come home, and you rarely come home.

41
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,330
I'm lonely.

42
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,840
Your mother's illness will get better soon, I'm sure.

43
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,580
Your older brother will be back soon, as well.

44
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,190
Until then, I have to make money and you have to watch over your mother.

45
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,600
That was our promise.

46
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,620
How many times did I say that to her... Only to leave her in that hellhole, over and over again...

47
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,630
And yet, she was always waiting... Always with a smile for her no-good father.

48
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,010
In the end, we just kept repeating this scene until her mother died.

49
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,160
I never once...was able to make a warm nest for her.

50
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,940
That's why you came to this distant place to find your nest...

51
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,380
We're taking off soon. Get ready to go, Kagura-chan.

52
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,270
How cold of them.

53
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,110
You're with them all this time, and they don't even come to see you off.

54
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,930
I guess you were the only one who felt close to them.

55
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,150
They didn't feel the same way...

56
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,480
The Earth's too small for you, after all.

57
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,480
Let's make this good-bye.

58
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:53,940
That's how it goes. Monsters like us... People either use us or hate us. One or the other...

59
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,690
In all likelihood, they probably saw us fighting and freaked out.

60
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,610
I'm sorry, Kagura.

61
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,100
I never wanted to see that expression on your face again.

62
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,680
It's all my fault.

63
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,770
Please let me make amends. I won't ever let you feel lonely again.

64
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,720
Even if we cannot live under the rays of the sun, we can live together under the light of the moon.

65
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,390
Kagura... I will protect you. And make this up to you...and your mother.

66
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,900
You stink...

67
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,400
You fired her?!

68
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,940
Keep it down, will you?

69
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,410
Stop talking so loud. Now look what you did.

70
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,730
I cut my toenail to the quick. What're you going to do about this?

71
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,030
You fired Kagura-chan?!

72
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,910
Does that mean Kagura-chan went home together with her father?!

73
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,190
How should I know? She probably did.

74
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,230
It's already been a day. She should be happy.

75
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,020
She always said she was saving up money to go back home. So this saves her the trouble.

76
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,000
And another thing, it's not right, after all.

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,130
A little girl shouldn't be living in a strange guy's house anyway.

78
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,580
She's lucky she was with me.

79
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,140
[Lolicon, literally "Lolita Complex," means a fetish for little girls.]

80
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,140
Nowadays you never know when you're gonna meet some sleaze with a lolicon and a polygon.

81
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,370
If I were her father, I'd kill the guy.

82
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,040
I'd stick my fingers up his nose and throw him across the roo--.

83
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,550
Owwww! You broke it off! You tore my nose off! What'd you do that for?!

84
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,420
You disappoint me, Gin-san.

85
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,520
Haven't you ever thought about Kagura-chan's feelings?

86
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,260
Huh? What's so bad about returning a runaway girl back to her father?

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,650
You really are stupid! Hopeless! Truly hopeless!

88
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,280
Hey, hopeless specs,

89
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,730
shall I bust those specs of yours and make you just plain "hopeless"?

90
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,590
You don't understand anything!

91
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,670
You have no idea how much Kagura-chan cherished this place!

92
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,640
I won't break even if I'm the last remaining branch.

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,040
I'll stick with the tree until the very end.

94
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,150
Kagura-chan thought the world of you...

95
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,860
You don't have to tell me that! We're already living the way we want to.

96
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,920
We came here because we wanted to.

97
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,320
We came here to be with you.

98
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,720
Forget it.

99
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,730
If that's what you really think, then I'm quitting, too.

100
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,970
Seems we were the only ones who thought we were friends.

101
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,730
If you want to quit, then quit.

102
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,770
I don't remember ever asking you or Kagura to come here.

103
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,020
Ouch...my back...

104
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,970
What is it, with all of you...

105
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,490
What? Got a problem with that? I won't feed you.

106
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,650
If you want to leave, you can go right ahead.

107
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,330
What? You won't find her there.

108
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,950
Tsk, you're a sharp one.

109
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,760
It's better this way. I don't really know what it's all about, this father-child thing.

110
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,840
But it's better this way.

111
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,390
This craft may rock or sway during transport.

112
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,580
Please fasten your seatbelts securely around...

113
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,420
your waist and please remain seated until the light goes out.

114
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,890
Sir, you can't. This ship will be leaving shortly.

115
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,000
You must remain seated until we reach stable airspace.

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,580
No, no, no, There's a little ship in my bowels that's about to take off too!

117
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,130
Bon voyage!

118
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,340
No, sir, that was not funny.

119
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,810
I'm telling you, I can't! Would it be funnier if I crap in my pants?!

120
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,890
Right here, right now!

121
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,810
Sir, please stop trying to be funny!

122
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,050
My muscles are losing control of the situation! They're losing it!

123
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,550
...ahh...it came out.

124
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,790
Get with it! Work faster, dammit!

125
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,310
That container goes here! That goes there!

126
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,840
That one, there! What is this place?

127
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,160
This is the luggage bay.

128
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,490
Who is that bossy old man?

129
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,960
He's, you know, a butler for that prince.

130
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,400
The idiotic prince of the Midland Star.

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,370
So all this creepy cargo belongs to that prince?

132
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,910
It's a collection of terrible taste. He's got to be dumb... Look at this stuff...

133
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,910
Be careful with that! These are all the Prince's treasures.

134
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,760
If you put so much as a scratch on them, I'll tear you limb from limb, I will!

135
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,970
All right.

136
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,070
Okay, I'm going back to my seat now.

137
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,770
But if you insult me behind my back, I swear I'll break your necks!

138
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,030
What?!

139
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,530
Hey! What've you done to the Prince's treasure?!

140
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,180
Tsk, who put this junk in my way!

141
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,270
He said junk! He called the Prince's treasure junk!

142
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,620
Stop making a scene. He's not going to notice one piece of junk missing, you ass!

143
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,150
Old man, you're insane.

144
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,540
Never mind. Hurry and clean this up. There'll be hell to pay if that idiot finds out.

145
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,250
A mop... Bring a mop. Huh?

146
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,250
Odd... Hey, where is the thing that was inside this?

147
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,840
What? How would we know? Was there something inside?

148
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,060
There should've been something similar to those things.

149
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,260
What? A monster like these?!

150
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,690
That's odd. How could a corpse disappear by itself?

151
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Just a minute... You can't go in there.

152
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,810
Sir, you can't go through here without a ticket!

153
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,640
We'll call the police!

154
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,360
Wait! Listen! Listen to me!

155
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,950
My, uh, girlfriend!

156
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,100
My girlfriend was kidnapped by an old guy with a hairdo like barcode

157
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,280
and the two of them are trying to run off on their honeymoon.

158
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,050
You expect me to believe you have a girlfriend.

159
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,020
You look like you haven't had a girlfriend for 16 years!

160
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,120
And what the hell is that supposed to mean?! How do you know my age?

161
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,150
Okay, I lied, I lied.

162
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,800
I was just trying to make myself look good.

163
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,850
The truth is, the barcode guy is my father.

164
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,740
He was tricked by a young girl looking for a sugar daddy and dumped his family.

165
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,670
Now he's about to commit suicide with her.

166
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,910
Don't lie to me! You look like your father already died!

167
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,310
How did you know? How come you know that?

168
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,910
Kagura-chan.

169
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know what kind of life you led before.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,890
And I don't know how you feel about your father.

171
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,760
But, I do know how much you loved Odd Jobs.

172
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,440
I know how much you cherished Gin-san.

173
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,060
I know, because...

174
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,940
I feel the same!

175
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,810
I'm sorry!

176
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,180
The three of us, together forever... I realize it would be impossible.

177
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,200
Someday... I knew we'd have to part.

178
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,920
But right now...

179
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,510
Man, that was an awful experience. Let me tell you about it, Kagura-chan.

180
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,770
Kagura-cha...

181
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,400
Right now, I still...

182
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,940
Hey... Hey! What is that?!

183
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,980
It's a man! There's a man on the ladder!

184
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,270
Wait! Wait!

185
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,510
Kagura-chan!! Where are you going?!

186
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,720
Odd Jobs means the three of us! Together!

187
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,920
Whatever Gin said to you, ignore him! He's a moron!

188
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,750
He doesn't even pay you a decent wage!

189
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,750
I can't handle that idiot by myself! I need you back at Odd Jobs with me!

190
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,490
That nimrod! What a stupid thing to do!

191
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,440
Shinpachi...

192
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,650
Shinpachi.

193
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,100
Shinpa...

194
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,250
Pappy!

195
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,500
You...

196
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,290
Emergency alarm! Emergency alarm!

197
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,330
We have an emergency at Gate 7!

198
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,940
We have an emergency at Gate 7!

199
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,840
All personnel, report to your posts immediately.

200
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,860
We repeat: all personnel, report to your posts immediately.

201
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,140
What is that thing?!

202
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,210
At least it's not coming this way! It's not coming this way, is it?

203
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,570
Oh god! It's coming this way!

204
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,820
Alien? Never heard the word. Sounds like a candy shop.

205
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,310
Is that Eirian?

206
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,310
[Eirian]

207
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,980
Well, we're not handing Earth over to the likes of you, bozos.

208
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,820
Earth belongs to us yakuza!

209
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,970
What? You'll what...? Uh...um... That's cruel.

210
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,130
You're, you know what, if you do that sort of thing, uh...

211
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,970
That's so wrong!

212
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,910
The battle of... Alien vs. Yakuza!

213
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,640
And so the battle for a planet begins!

214
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,680
What will be the fate of Earth?

215
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,840
You can see the rest of this story in the theater.

216
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,070
No one's coming! Who'd want to come?!

217
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,420
Who's gonna fall for this lame teaser?! Look at you losers!

218
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,410
Were you even listening at the meeting?

219
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,550
What's up with "That's so wrong"? What's wrong is you guys!

220
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,430
You think standing there frozen is gonna impress me?

221
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,960
You're serious only about the part that doesn't matter!

222
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,700
And after I went through the trouble to get you work.

223
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,590
Forget it, you guys. Just shut up and hold the damned flags.

224
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,070
Sadaharu-kun, keep your butt quiet, too, please.

225
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,360
Hey, Gin-san, what happened to the others?

226
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,070
That nondescript guy with the glasses and that China girl? With their help, it would be...

227
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,730
How would I know. I can do anything myself even if they aren't around.

228
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,190
Why? Because Gin-san is very versatile.

229
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,420
Hey, don't completely ruin my image of "versatile."

230
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,970
Hey, Hasegawa-san, the boss is calling for you.

231
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,790
What? This isn't good. He said if we didn't show results, he'd fire us on the spot.

232
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:27,650
No point bringing in a crowd today. Nobody's gonna want to come and see fake aliens.

233
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,990
You see?

234
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,960
People got a real alien to worry about.

235
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,970
Hey, where is that? Is that the terminal?

236
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,450
Seems a huge alien took over a ship and caused an accident.

237
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,230
Can we get our camera closer?

238
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,700
I'm sorry, uh...can you see it, everyone?

239
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,160
A mysterious creature has caused an accident involving a ship inside the terminal.

240
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,460
You can see the nose of the crashed spaceship where it breached the terminal wall.

241
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,050
There is concern for the safety of the passengers.

242
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,460
It's frightening.

243
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,610
But what is this sinister creature?

244
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,090
Huh? Just a minute... Is that a person?

245
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,180
I'm positive. It is a man! A man!

246
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,240
Huh? A young girl?!

247
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,140
Oh my gosh. It's a young girl!

248
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,020
A lone young girl is on the spaceship's hull...

249
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,450
and it looks as if she's fighting

250
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,010
H-Hey, Gin-san... That's...!

251
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,950
I don't believe it. Is she human?!

252
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,310
Hey... Hey...pull yourself together, lad. Hey.

253
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,250
Am I in the world of the dead?

254
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,070
I don't see gardens of flowers. I see a burnt plain.

255
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,750
Whose head are you calling a burnt plain?

256
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,610
You want to go to hell? You want to live happily forever in a flower garden?

257
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,870
Umibozu-san?

258
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,980
Quickly, get outta here, lad. Or you'll be killed.

259
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,480
Who'd have thought it'd still be alive?

260
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,510
And where'd he eat enough to get that big?

261
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,960
I should've made sure he was dead.

262
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,350
It'll engulf this place soon. Get going.

263
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,680
What about you, Baldy?

264
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,730
Who the hell are you calling "Baldy", boy?

265
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,620
I don't see Kagura-chan.

266
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,150
Knowing her, she probably remained on the ship to look after the others.

267
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,970
Wait.

268
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,710
I'm coming too. I just can't leave...Kagura-chan there.

269
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,540
You'll get in my way. Go home.

270
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:21,790
From here on, it's a battlefield. Weak life forms like you will only be a liability.

271
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,700
This is where we belong.

272
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,950
Those eyes.

273
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,990
But I...

274
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,470
I told you: we live in a different world.

275
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,940
Forget about Kagura. You'll only make her unhappy.

276
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,250
Do you think people can change so easily?

277
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,080
No, people can't change.

278
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,900
She struggled and struggled, but in the end, she couldn't change.

279
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,930
All the pain of trying to change...was just that. Pain.

280
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,500
Help us!

281
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,350
Quickly! This way!

282
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,810
There it is! The Alien has exploded in size!

283
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,240
This is dangerous. Way too dangerous!

284
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,440
Even I feel like running away.

285
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,190
It's dangerous. Clear out of here!

286
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,020
Ack! It's the Shinsengumi. The guardians of Edo,

287
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,180
The Shinsengumi armed police have arrived on the scene.

288
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,400
We'll be fine now.

289
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:46,420
Alien, you are completely surrounded. Give yourself up quietly.

290
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,990
Huh? What are you doing?

291
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,860
Your mother back in your hometown is crying!

292
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,670
She didn't raise you to be this kind of alien.

293
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,930
Right, Mom?

294
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,390
Say something.

295
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,180
What? Are you serious?! I don't believe this!

296
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,980
Do you know what your father said just before he died?

297
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,660
Until the very end, Daddy cared only about you.

298
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,690
What the hell are you guys doing?!

299
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,440
The Bakufu gave this Terminal "Architectural Landmark" status.

300
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,120
If we start shooting, It'll be our heads that roll.

301
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,910
This is no time for that! All our heads will roll if you don't do something!

302
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,910
Hey! If you don't get away quickly, you'll get killed!

303
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,780
What is it with you?

304
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,980
You leave the press to die while you escape in a patrol car?!

305
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,180
What's with you people?!

306
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,050
I never imagined that thing would still be alive.

307
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:36,290
I don't know how it got here, but it's turned into a major disaster.

308
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,780
Seems it's tougher than we imagined.

309
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,310
Apparently, the more it eats, the bigger it gets. And it eats energy.

310
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,240
Which makes it especially bad news that it's making the terminal its nest.

311
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,230
Incredible amounts of energy pump through this place to teleport ships.

312
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:59,280
This thing's sudden growth is because it's consuming the immense energy flowing though the terminal.

313
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,410
This is bad. At this rate, Edo will be devoured.

314
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,200
What're you shooting?!

315
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,750
Ow ow ow ow!

316
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,650
I'm scared!

317
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,990
What's going to happen to Edo?

318
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,970
What's going to happen to me? I'm unemployed again.

319
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,060
Why should I care if Edo gets destroyed?

320
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,730
Ack! What's that?!

321
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,230
Something's coming this way...flying past the fleeing crowd.

322
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,060
Is that a...dog?

323
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,630
No...a samurai?!

324
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,710
Boss?!

325
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,330
What're you...?!

326
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,580
Is this a TV camera? A camera?

327
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,950
Um... "Alien vs. Yakuza," the movie...

328
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,060
Playing in theaters now. Don't miss it.

329
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,790
What just happened?! Who is that mysterious man?!

330
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,020
Wait! It's dangerous!

331
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,530
Gin-san, you're too late. We've already been fired.

332
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,720
Kagura-chan!

333
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,680
Where are you?! Pappy's right here!

334
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,440
This is bad.

335
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,830
This is the toughest fight since that time I eradicated the giant cockroach.

336
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,540
No, since the fight I had with the wife when we were newlyweds.

337
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,880
Oh, are you guys hurt or just taking a dump?

338
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,690
Hang in there, assistant manager.

339
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,640
Hey, what's with the demotion?

340
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,720
Are you all right? How'd you get that thing on your forehead?

341
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,100
Did the alien do that to you?

342
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,160
These are the marks of our exalted people!! Fool!!

343
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,370
Her umbrella...

344
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,770
Hey, have you seen Kagura?! You saw her, didn't you?

345
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,410
A cute girl with big round eyes that look exactly like mine!

346
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm not responsible! I'm not responsible! It's not my fault!

347
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,240
It's the Prince's fault! It's because he keeps a collection of monsters!

348
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,220
What? It's not my fault!

349
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,680
The customs people should have checked to make sure it was dead!

350
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,250
Boss!

351
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,340
That fool! Does he want to get killed?!

352
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,930
Sadaharu, time for your walk.

353
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,710
Today, you're free to poop or play wherever you want. You can go wild.

354
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,040
Let's go!

355
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,370
What?

356
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,880
She's a girl with refined facial features who looks just like me. Have you seen her?

357
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,460
I have. I saw a cute girl who looks like you!

358
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,350
Is she a queen of some planet? She was a truly cute darling of a girl.

359
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,660
You should've told me! Please...

360
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,860
I'm an old man and I'm impatient.

361
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,670
Over there.

362
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,750
But it's too...

363
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,060
She rescued us, but the monster...

364
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,330
Kagura!

365
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,070
[To Be Continued]

366
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:27,980
[Preview]

367
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,860
Oh my! Gin-san was eaten by the alien!

368
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,470
And Baldy is hurt trying to protect the injured Kagura-chan.

369
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,670
Isn't that the Bakufu's battleship?!

370
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,740
If she fires with all cannons, everyone will be killed.

371
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,740
The next episode: "You Know What Happens if You Pee on a Worm."

372
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,850
[A giant alien puts Edo on the brink of destruction.]

373
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,060
[What is the fate of Kagura, who is on the brink of death?! And where is Gintoki?!]
