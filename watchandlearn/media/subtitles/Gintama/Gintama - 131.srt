Yes, I know.

00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,130
They should be arriving shortly. Yes, we're all busy.

[A request from me, Otose.]

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,290
Don't worry. The one thing I can guarantee is that they're a lively bunch.

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,740
But how are things on your side?

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,680
Oh, the usual. Everything's the same as before on this side.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,640
Really, nothing's changed at all...

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,200
since the old days.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,810
All right, let's work hard again today!

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,690
Heh, you're awfully energetic.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,170
Well, of course.

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,040
We have to do our best every day so that our customers are satisfied.

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,280
Well, don't overdo it. If anything should happen to you, this inn will...

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,350
It will all be okay.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,600
Because you promised me, right?

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,260
Yeah, that's right.

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,220
Now let's go, Rei.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,620
Okay!

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,770
It's a promise.

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,970
I'll protect this inn...and you.

23
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,420
We're pretty deep in the mountains.

24
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,110
According to the old lady, it's a hidden hot spring known only to a few.

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,680
The hot springs are all booked up during this time of year.

26
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,020
It's like a dream to be able to spend our winter break resting and

27
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,640
relaxing in the baths at a place like this.

28
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,220
Otose knows the Okami, so she was able to get us rooms.

29
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,810
Go spend some time relaxing in the baths for a change.

30
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,350
I gotta say, Mrs. Otose can be nice sometimes.

31
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,290
I have a bad feeling about this.

32
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,930
When that old hag does something like this, there's usually a catch.

33
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,600
When you can't accept someone's goodwill with an open heart, it's over for you.

["Fights Often Ensue During Trips"]

35
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,170
I wonder if we took the wrong road.

36
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,370
There's just this dilapidated old building.

37
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,030
Shinpachi, can't you even read a map?

38
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,630
That's strange. It's supposed to be right here.

39
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,630
Let's see... It's called Senbokyo, right?

40
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,560
Huh? This sign?

41

[Welcome to the Senbokyo Hot Springs]

42
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,560
Doesn't it say Senbokyo?

43
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,820
The paint seems to have run and it looks all eerie, but...

44
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,640
I think...this is the place.

45
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,600
This is a picture of an old man taking a soak.

46
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,760
Are you kidding?! We're supposed to stay in this rundown inn?

47
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,980
I mean, is this place really open? I don't see any signs of people.

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,320
We'll go look for someone. Let's go, Kagura.

49
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,310
Hey hey, give me a break! This is definitely a haunted house.

50
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,830
It's really creepy. Why are there so many crows flying around?

51
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,430
I don't have spiritual powers or anything, but it feels sorta, you know.

52
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,220
What do you mean, "you know"?

53
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,060
Never mind.

54
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,670
Cut it out, will you? I mean really.

55
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,430
Hey, there's someone. An employee?

56
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,860
Excuse me! Mrs. Terada from Edo referred us here.

57
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,020
Excuse me!

58
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,180
Maybe she can't hear.

59
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,050
That hurts!

60
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,670
G-Gin ... That person...

61
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,680
She's walking on the snow, yet...

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
there are...no footprints.

63
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,640
Wh-Wh-What's going on?!

64
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,310
Was that a ghost? Huh? A ghost?!

65
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,140
No way! Not in broad daylight!

66
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,030
No way! Absolutely not! No way, I won't allow it! I absolutely won't allow it!

67
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,490
Please calm down, Gin!

68
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,190
Pr-Probably when you're this deep in the mountains,

69
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,800
there's so much snow that it freezes over and you don't leave footprints.

70
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,130
Oh, you're right. That must be it.

71
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,830
No way! No way, absolutely not!

72
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,220
I won't allow it! I absolutely won't allow it!

73
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,610
But she acted a bit strange, didn't she?

74
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,840
She didn't hear your voice and...

75
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,440
Didn't she sorta look semi-transparent?

76
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,450
Hey, cut it out, will you?! I said there's no way!

77
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,670
What's wrong with being semi-transparent?

78
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,420
Even grocery bags these days are semi-transparent!

79
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,080
So there must be people who are semi-transparent, too!

80
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,220
What? Are you scared? Don't tell me you're scared?!

81
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,460
Well, it's okay. If you insist, we can go home. Wanna go home?

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,690
You're the one who wants to go home!

83
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,980
Besides, even if we wanted to go home,

84
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,160
there's only one bus that passes through this place each day.

85
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,770
We have no choice but to spend the night.

86
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,620
Let's stop this already.

87
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,350
We're here at a hot springs inn. And look at us.

88
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,590
We're over-imagining things. Let's try to brighten up and enjoy this.

89
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,290
You're right. It's our imagination.

90
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,120
Sorry, if I said things to scare you, Gin.

91
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,790
I don't know why you're apologizing.

92
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,540
Scared? What's that? Tell me how that feels!

93
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,220
Gin! We found the Okami!

94
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,360
Oh, that's good. See, Gin, they're open for business.

95
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,290
There's nothing wrong with this place.

96
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,820
I'm so sorry.

97
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,470
You arrived already? Thank you for coming so far.

98
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,530
Welcome. I am the Okami, Oiwa.

99
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,230
Huh? Which is the Okami? Huh, which one?

100
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,980
I'm sorry I was late to welcome you.

101
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,630
I run this place all alone, so...

102
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,430
Umm...no, there is someone else.

103
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,260
There's definitely someone behind you.

104
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,430
Someone who's semi-transparent!

105
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,540
Hey! What is that?!

106
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,430
She's carrying something on her back! Is it a baby?

107
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,720
It's a baby, right?! Please say it is!

108
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,750
That's what I'd like to think!

109
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,180
But it's semi-transparent! It's really semi-transparent!

110
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,530
So, what's wrong with being semi-transparent?!

111
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,070
In this day and age, even politicians are semi-transparent!

112
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,040
They're all involved in shady deals and graft!

113
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,980
So there's bound to be a semi-transparent baby!

114
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,070
But it's strange. Sister and Kagura aren't reacting at all!

115
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,460
The place isn't so bad. This is my first time at a Hot Springs.

116
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,890
Anyone would react upon seeing a baby like that!

117
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,550
Oh, really?

118
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,180
I'm going to get my skin all smooth!

119
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,180
They don't see it. We're the only ones!

120
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,050
I didn't believe in spirits...

121
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,010
But that is a ghost! The Okami is totally possessed by a spirit!

122
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,390
No, it's not only the Okami. What I saw earlier...

123
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,100
Isn't this hot spring inn like super dangerous?!

124
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,430
Don't be ridiculous!

125
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,780
A ghost inn?! Impossible.

126
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,160
No way. Absolutely not.

127
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,050
I will not acknowledge that! I absolutely refuse to believe that!

128
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,980
Then how do you explain that thing on the Okami?

129
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,200
Well... I thought it couldn't be...

130
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,980
but I think my hunch is right.

131
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,220
That Okami...

132
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,010
[We named it "Stand" from it being Stand by me!]

133
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,660
is a  Stand User.

134
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
[No way!]

135
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,340
How can there be a Stand like that, you idiot?!

136
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,240
No matter how you look at it, that's a Stand.

137
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,510
I mean, basically, we're Stand Users too.

138
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,220
That's why we were able to see the Okami's Stand.

139
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,190
Hold on! Since when did we become Stand users?!

140
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,110
I usually hide it. But you always show your Stand.

141
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,580
That thing hanging on your ear!

142
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,380
That's just a spectacles user!

143
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,310
"That thing hanging on your ear"?!

144
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,220
You know full well what it is. They're spectacles!

145
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,860
Oh, you call that Stand "Spectacles"?

146
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,410
He's pissing me off. This guy is so pissing me off.

147
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,350
Are you that determined to disavow the existence of a spirit? You're pitiful!

148
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,100
I mean, take a look at that!

149
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,590
Huh? The spirit is gone.

150
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,890
It wasn't a spirit. That was a Stand!

151
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,980
Huh, where'd it go?

152
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,990
Hey, maybe it was an illusion?

153
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,830
Are you saying that we were so scared that we saw something that really wasn't there?

154
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,480
Well, let's leave it at that.

155
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,890
I don't have the guts to acknowledge such a presence, and then spend the night here.

156
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,940
You're right. It was just an illusion.

157
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,890
It was a demon that our weak minds conjured up.

158
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,980
We'd better shape up. We're samurai. How shameful!

159
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,500
Yes. We can't get lackadaisical just because we've come to a hot springs inn.

160
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,770
Samurai must always be upright and alert!

161
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,850
The rooms are quite small.

162
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,490
It's tough for four people, so I prepared two rooms.

163
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,840
Which do you prefer? Japanese-style or western-style rooms?

164
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,290
You have western-style rooms?

165
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,720
Sleeping on a bed would be nice for a change.

166
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,150
Japanese style!

167
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,380
We're samurai, after all!

168
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,800
Yes, fine.

169
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,390
You samurai will be...

170
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,150
...in this room.

171
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,240
The room is sealed!

172
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,090
Those are clear signs that some giant beast has been sealed inside!

173
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,910
What's going on?! Just what happened inside this room?!

174
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,570
This is bad. There is something definitely strange about this inn!

175
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,150
The young ladies are over this way.

176
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,090
Err, excuse me! Can we change to western-style?

177
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,980
Huh?! But you're samurai.

178
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,930
Well, actually fake samurai... as in, sham-urai.

179
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,030
But the ladies took that room.

180
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,540
Why? Is there something you didn't like?

181
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,750
Well, rather than didn't like...

182
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,810
The sliding doors...

183
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,910
Oh, you didn't like the design of this door?

184
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,390
Design? This is the design?!

185
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,110
Well, there was a time when I was really into rock.

186
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,140
Rock?! This is punk rock?

187
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,080
My name, Oiwa, means rock, you know?

188
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,630
And these things were all the rage back then. Even I was young at one time.

189
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,390
It's not "rock." It's something different. More like "lock."

190
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:56,890
[The seals have writing like "forbidden," "taboo," "dangerous," etc.]

191
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,530
Oh! Could it be these seals are bothering you?

192
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,000
Huh? Umm, yes.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,640
Oh, come on!

194
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,590
Is that it? Oh no. These are different.

195
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,580
Well, these are... I hate to admit this to you as the Okami...

196
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,170
But a guest with a child stayed here before.

197
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,770
And the child misbehaved and put holes in the sliding doors.

198
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,960
Oh! Is that it? So these are to hide the holes?

199
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,060
Shh! This is a secret. You must not tell anyone!

200
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,140
Is that all? You should have just told us sooner.

201
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,650
We imagined the worst, Okami!

202
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,810
This is no laughing matter. It was really terrible with holes everywhere.

203
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,720
I taught the boy a lesson after that, for one hour.

204
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,160
Really, I shouldn't have been so harsh on him over a few holes in the sliding door.

205
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,010
Full turn left!

206
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,100
Hey! How dare you barge into a lady's room?!

207
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,770
Wh-What's this commotion all about?

208
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,100
Did something happen?

209
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,680
Gin! All clear! I don't see it anywhere.

210
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,810
Okay!

211
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,140
Please! Change rooms with us!

212
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,450
Huh?

213
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,480
I have this sudden urge to stay in a western-style room!

214
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,640
We're not samurai or anything, merely pigs!

215
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,790
Hey? This is western-style? Didn't you ask for a western-style room?

216
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,520
This is a Japanese-style room.

217
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,310
Yes, we asked for one.

218
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,770
But when we entered, we found this Japanese-style room.

219
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,780
I don't know what's western about it.

220
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,390
Now you know, so leave!

221
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,220
It's small in here and you're crowding us. There is no western-style room!

222
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,180
W-Western-style room ...

223
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,430
...as in that kind?!

224
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,340
Why?! Why's there a foreigner Stand over there?! I don't understand!

225
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,220
What's with this inn?! This place is full of Stands!

226
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,090
What are you shouting about? Stand?

227
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,310
Oh, sorry. It's just something between us.

228
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,390
You're better off not knowing about some things in the world.

229
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,780
There seems to be something up.

230
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,180
Don't try to hide it. Tell me. We'll hear you out.

231
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,890
Nothing you say will shock me.

232
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,510
Oh, well...

233
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,010
Refreshment time!

234
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,370
Here you go. I brought you an afternoon snack.

235
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,100
Oh, thank you very much! But don't trouble yourself.

236
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,350
Oh no, I want you to stay and relax. Think of this as your own home.

237
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,090
Oh, I prepared the bath, so go and soak anytime.

238
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,990
Yes, thank you.

239
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,850
If you say anything, I'll kill you.

240
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,470
Th-The Okami!

241
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,100
Wh-What's the meaning of this?!

242
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,540
Who is that old hag?!

243
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,810
She knows! That Okami knows all about this!

244
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,460
Not only that! She was feeding the Stand those peanuts!

245
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,950
Man, we've come to a crazy place!

246
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,400
This hot springs inn...

247
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,200
is swarming with those evil spirits nurtured by that old hag.

248
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,960
It's a hot spring inn of death!

249
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,990
No way!

250
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,910
Gin! Shinpachi!

251
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,400
We're leaving! We must get off this mountain immediately!

252
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,050
If we stick around here, we'll end up as fodder for the ghosts for sure!

253
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,910
Never mind waiting for the bus! We'll make a run for it now!

254
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,890
Right!

255
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,190
Hey! Is there anyone on that side?

256
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,770
Looks like there's been a landslide and the road is blocked.

257
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,510
You won't be able to come down the mountain for a while.

258
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,500
Well, there should be a hot springs inn over there,

259
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,840
so ask them to put you up there.

260
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,030
There are rumors that it's haunted, though.

261
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,750
Huh? Why aren't you laughing, too?

262
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,180
I'm just joking!

263
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,850
Isn't it such a nice bath?

264
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,600
This inn looked so old, I was worried at first.

265
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,850
But it's quite nice. Its age is beginning to appeal to me.

266
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,340
I like the fact that there's no other guests.

267
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,900
It's like we have the whole place to ourselves.

268
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,950
We can do whatever we like. I can pee in the water and no one will scold me.

269
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,420
I will scold you.

270
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,740
And it seems we're not the only guests.

271
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,650
Kondo, you're here too?!

272
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,420
No, you're wrong, Kagura.

273
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,890
The monkeys came from the mountain to soak in the baths.

274
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,330
Maybe they're females who want nice, smooth skin?

275
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,280
They're hairy, sneaky ones.

276
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,180
Only their butts are smooth.

277
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,870
Well, it's still a nice hot spring.

278
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,740
Gin, how are you doing on your side?

279
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,360
Huh? I wonder if something happened?

280
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,640
Gin! Shinpachi! Did you guys get dizzy from a long bath?!

281
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,680
There...are so...many.

282
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,410
Oh, you mean there are monkeys on your side too?

283
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,740
No. They're really strange.

284
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,930
What's the matter?! Are you surrounded by guys with tattoos?!

285
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,890
Kagura! What if you're right?

286
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,850
Sorry, all you tattooed people!

287
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,200
I didn't mean to insult you.

288
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,390
But if you're upset, please feel free to throw those two into a pool of cement.

289
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,090
Tattooed people would have been so much better.

290
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,390
I'd be so happy, I'd jump into the cement or into the deep sea voluntarily!

291
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,320
Faint! Knock myself out!

292
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,250
Gin!

293
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,260
Damn it! Why won't I faint?! Stupid!

294
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,280
Die!

295
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,650
Calm down, Gin!

296
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,550
Get a hold of yourself!

297
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,570
No way! I so won't get a hold of myself!

298
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,570
I'll hang it loosely upside down!

299
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,140
I'll wear my pants hanging at the hip.

300
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,360
What's with this hot spring?! What's with those things in the bath?!

301
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,700
I've heard that spirits gather where there's water, but this is...

302
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,040
They're not spirits, they're Stands!

303
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,140
Don't call them spirits!

304
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,130
Huh? Hey, wait a minute.

305
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
On closer inspection, could it be the steam?

306
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,350
No, you're wrong.

307
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,110
No, it's the steam.

308
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,710
It's just swirling around and looks like people, semi-transparent people.

309
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,160
Shinpachi, breathe it in. You'll get morning sickness.

310
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Why're we talking about a pregnant woman now?!

311
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,900
I said...

312
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,660
...breathe!

313
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,520
What're you doing?!

314
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,520
See? There's nothing. It was the steam.

315
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,970
It was the steam!

316
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,690
Oh, you're right.

317
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,220
[Cursed]

318
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,850
It was nothing.

319
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,170
Let me just apologize. Sorry.

320
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,590
Huh? Why? Is something wrong?

321
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,740
Oh, nothing. You just look like you're 100,016 years old.

322
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,880
Hey Gin, they're all gone. I guess it was the steam, after all.

323
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,180
No, it wasn't the steam. I can verify that.

324
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,400
I think we should get out, though.

325
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,880
The heat is getting to me...myself.

326
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,970
Did you just say you yourself?

327
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,150
I myself feel a bit heavy.

328
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,840
Even that looks 100,016 years old!

329
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,810
That itself is changed!

330
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,870
What'll I do?! Otae will kill me!

331
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,470
Huh? What're you saying?

332
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,150
I'd better apologize once more.

333
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,570
I'm sorry, Shinpachi!

334
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,980
Oh, that was a nice soak.

335
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,560
Oh! Sister, Kagura!

336
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,260
Look! Our skin is silky smooth!

337
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,260
[Cursed]

338
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,790
Who the hell are you?!

339
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,260
Who the hell are you?! Which one's which, and who's who?!

340
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,390
What are you saying? It's me!

341
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,480
And I myself.

342
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,800
And I myself!

343
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,460
You're all like that!

344
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,310
Why don't we go to our room and play UNO?

345
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,550
That sounds good. Let's play!

346
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,860
I wonder if you can beat me!

347
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,230
What's going on?! They're all possessed!

348
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,540
Hey! Wait! Don't leave me here alone! Hey!

349
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,280
Okami!

350
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,030
Why you...old hag!

351
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,080
Damn it!

352
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,470
Where the hell did you go?!

353
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,180
Come on out!

354
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,310
Damn you! Just what do you intend to do with us?!

355
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,860
Just what is this inn anyway?!

356
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,720
Turn them back to normal!

357
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,420
We can use him.

358
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,040
Yes, he'll do fine.

359
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,960
All right, congratulations!

360
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,830
You've passed the job interview.

361
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,960
