2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,070
I never would have imagined this.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,080
To be able to see the moon
from Yoshiwara...

4
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,310
Oh, don't be so silly.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,750
You came to Yoshiwara only after
its liberation. Isn't that right, sir?

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,450
No...

7
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,720
It existed long ago...

8
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,330
The ceiling may have been shut,

9
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,610
but the moon existed back then.

10
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,190
A small, brave, and beautiful moon.

11
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,230
Again?

12
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,580
The seventh one this month.

13
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,830
We can no longer ignore this.

14
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,920
At this rate, Yoshiwara...

15
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,160
will never be able to recover.

16
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,540
Also...

17
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,560
Thank you for your patronage, sir.

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,130
Of course.

19
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,040
I see.

20
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,480
Thank you very much!

21
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,150
Excuse me.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,800
No, excuse me.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,840
You've come a long way,

24
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,570
Tsukuyo.

25
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,060
Give up on being a woman,

26
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,160
Tsukuyo.

27
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,920
If you wish to become one who protects
instead of one who is protected,

28
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,650
give up on being a woman.

29
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,680
You may not be the sun which
shines above the people.

30
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,710
But I, alone, know of your beauty which
secretly illuminates the land.

31
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,170
I, alone, shall watch over you.

32
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,180
I, alone...

33
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,810
will protect you.

34
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,880
Ma-

35
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,970
Whatcha doing, Tsukuyo?

36
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,160
Gin-san and everybody are here!

37
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,190
Wake up already!

38
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,460
I'm gonna leave without ya!

39
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,220
I'm coming.

40
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,600
Go on ahead.

41
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,710
Don't forget to spruce yourself up.

42
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,180
Spruce up, is it?

43
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,090
["It's Bad Luck to See a Spider at Night"]

44
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,150
Hey, it's been a while.

45
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,860
Sheesh, still looking as dull as ever.

46
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,020
And you still look as much like
a burnt field as ever.

47
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,070
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!

48
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,310
You'd better not be talking about my hair!

49
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,030
Come on, it's been a while
since we last met.

50
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,720
Could you two please stop fighting?

51
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,150
Now that everyone's here,
we can have a blast!

52
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,170
Sorry, Seita.

53
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,060
Huh?

54
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,800
Could you wait outside for a moment?

55
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,150
What?!

56
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,110
Hold on!

57
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,290
I haven't even been in
a close-up shot yet!

58
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,280
That's all the screen time I get?!

59
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,510
You should be glad that everyone
was able to see you so happy.

60
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,780
No way!

61
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,970
You've crossed the line here, Mom.

62
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,050
This is what I get, after
waiting half a year?

63
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,250
You see, what I wanted to talk
to you guys about...

64
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,730
Screw them.

65
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,020
Stupid show.

66
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,830
I even sat back from the TV in a well-lit
room every week to watch this show.

67
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,740
Hey, now. Give me a break.

68
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,100
I didn't come here to work today.

69
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,730
Pretty please? Savior of Yoshiwara?

70
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,340
There is certainly more freedom in
Yoshiwara after Hosen's death.

71
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:13,840
However, we have some new vermin who used
to stay clear of Yoshiwara because of Hosen.

72
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,850
After all, there was nothing more powerful
than Hosen to deter crime.

73
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,840
To be honest, the crime rate was
lower with Hosen around.

74
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,090
There's no end to the assaults,
burglaries, break-ins,

75
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,010
and other crimes committed by
the Anti-Foreigner Faction.

76
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,790
The members of the Hyakka
aren't able to keep up.

77
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,480
The biggest problem in Yoshiwara
at the moment

78
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,120
would be the sale of illegal drugs.

79
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,040
Prostitutes whose bodies and
souls have been worn out

80
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,800
turn to drugs for a moment of pleasure.

81
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,580
This town may appear at peace,

82
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,580
but they've already spread far
and wide in the shadows.

83
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,780
There's one man running most
of the business in Yoshiwara.

84
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,800
Fujinosuke Hashiba, said to be
Yoshiwara's best customer...

85
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,600
No, his name holds no meaning.

86
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,930
He has many names.

87
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,610
Not only names.

88
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,210
He has multiple titles and faces.

89
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,230
But I doubt that any are
grounded in reality.

90
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,440
He must be laughing as we struggle
to find incriminating evidence,

91
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,410
while he buys Yoshiwara women, drinks liquor,

92
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,710
and watches as this town
collapses around him.

93
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,740
How are we supposed to
catch a guy like that?

94
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,220
I barely deserve the title
of Yoshiwara's Savior.

95
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,570
You should know.

96
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,350
I'm doing business under the table here.

97
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,140
Nevertheless, we need your
familiarity with this world.

98
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,570
Don't worry.

99
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,160
I have a lead.

100
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,010
What?

101
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,750
I saw a spider.

102
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,720
While I was on watch, I clearly saw it.

103
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,390
A spider tattoo on that man's neck...

104
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,900
A spider, huh?

105
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,560
Not much to go by, but oh well.

106
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,270
I'll have to let myself be caught.

107
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,800
In the spider web.

108
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,750
C'mon! Place your bets!

109
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,650
Evens or odds?

110
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,640
Make your choice!

111
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,830
Place your bets!

112
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,420
Even!

113
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,080
Odd!

114
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,550
Even!

115
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:37,790
Odd!

116
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,610
Odd!

117
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,690
Even!

118
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,970
They all have spider tattoos?

119
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,960
The Benigumoto (Red Spiders).

120
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,700
This gambling parlor is on their turf.

121
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,330
There wouldn't be any problem if they
spent all their time rolling dice,

122
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,580
but they're the ones claiming to be

123
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,970
Anti-Foreigner Faction as they
rob, threaten, and kill people.

124
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,400
A bunch of thieves willing to do anything.

125
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,770
Well, I wouldn't say that they're cut out to take
over as the big evil group in Yoshiwara,

126
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,100
but there may be a connection.

127
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,350
You should get going.

128
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,040
I'll stand out if I have a woman with me.

129
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,680
Besides, women can't stand
many-legged creatures.

130
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,860
Fool.

131
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,830
How could the leader of the Hyakka
run away at this point?

132
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,760
Besides, I've already said that I stopped
being a woman long ago.

133
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,890
You're the type that's guaranteed
to press charges

134
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,580
if my elbow happens to poke
your boob on a packed train.

135
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,300
Leave, stupid.

136
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,050
Then go ahead and touch me.

137
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,840
I don't mind.

138
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,660
Huh?

139
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,550
I won't let myself be taken lightly.

140
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,090
Touch me.

141
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,430
I'm not going to touch you.

142
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,920
I don't want any unnecessary trouble.

143
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,440
[Note: To Love-Ru, a sexy-romantic-comedy that was published in JUMP. It's pronounced the same as "trouble".]

144
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,440
You won't run into any To Love-Ru.

145
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,530
Fool.

146
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,980
Just touch me already.

147
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,570
Hey, don't underestimate To Love-Ru.

148
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,170
Wake up to find a naked girl in your bed.

149
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,660
Trip and dive into another girl's crotch.

150
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,970
Even your little sister doesn't mind.

151
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,270
I told you, stuff like that won't happen!

152
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,340
Touch me already!

153
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,400
Cut it out!

154
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,700
A girl shouldn't say stuff like that!

155
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,410
You're supposed to save that
phrase for when it counts...

156
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,740
A spider!

157
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,160
Huh?

158
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,010
This is...

159
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,310
Wh-What...

160
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,470
What do you think you're doing?!

161
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,040
Hey...

162
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,440
This isn't how you said it'd be?

163
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,760
Zip it.

164
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,490
You have no right to talk.

165
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,690
Uh...

166
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,990
Who are you people?

167
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,670
Which gang y'all from?

168
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,530
Why ya peekin' in our place?

169
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,670
'Fess up.

170
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,860
I was getting some puff-puff action.

171
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,400
Like hell you were!

172
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,940
Come up with a better lie!

173
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,050
Uh, that's actually what I was doing.

174
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,420
More like, I was forced into doing it.

175
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,020
Don't insinuate anything weird.

176
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,090
In any case, we were just doing
some puff-puff action.

177
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,460
Nothing suspicious about us at all.

178
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,370
You'd be pretty damn suspicious if that
was what you were actually doing!

179
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,620
Uh, to be honest...

180
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,430
We're a couple of thugs who wanna
join the Benigumoto.

181
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:28,990
Wha-?!

182
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,830
What? Thugs?

183
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,720
Heh, you've got balls.

184
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,200
You brought a woman to come
see me, the great Unkai,

185
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,830
head of the Benigumoto?

186
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,920
No way.

187
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,500
I never meant to offend you.

188
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,260
Cut me some slack, Unkie Turd.

189
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,240
Who are you calling Unkie Turd?!

190
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,360
I've just been a little constipated lately.

191
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,560
We're a married thug couple.

192
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,050
Huh?!

193
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,230
Both of us are intent on joining
the Benigumoto together.

194
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,030
Right? We're a couple of thugs.

195
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,070
Wha...?!

196
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,200
We had our kids grow mullets.

197
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,110
And we force them to
wear tattoo jackets.

198
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,750
That's right.

199
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,240
I lead a gang of girls.

200
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,270
Gintoki was top dog at West High.

201
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,640
I was attracted to his lone wolf attitude
and got knocked up and married at 17.

202
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,960
Rode the winds of Shonan during pregnancy
and ended up with twins.

203
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,460
[Note: The names combine to form "Diablock",
a Japanese block toy similar to Lego.]

204
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,460
Dia and Block have hair
down to their waist now.

205
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,360
Dia? Block?

206
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,510
You gave your kids some crazy names!

207
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,540
Boss!

208
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,840
No doubt about it!

209
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,390
These guys are genuine thugs!

210
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,740
Why not let them join?

211
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,520
I'd be more than happy
to welcome this babe.

212
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,060
Even if she's damaged goods.

213
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,580
Come on, she's married.

214
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,020
Exactly.

215
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,550
I get turned on when I take something
that belongs to another person.

216
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,440
Let's ice the husband and take turns
getting some of that puff-puff action!

217
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,580
Don't take me lightly.

218
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,700
I could skewer every single
one of you in an instant,

219
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,440
if I wanted to.

220
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,010
And here's a heads-up.

221
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,640
My husband is a hundred
times stronger than me.

222
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,260
Your husband's been skewered.

223
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,180
Wha-?

224
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,500
You threw it without any warning.

225
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,430
Say something next time.

226
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,840
Sorry.

227
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,110
The husband aside, this woman
should prove useful.

228
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,300
It can never hurt to have
too many bodyguards.

229
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,980
Work your asses off.

230
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,760
Gintoki. What if, what if...

231
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,550
these Benigumoto have absolutely
nothing to do with the case?

232
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,840
What will happen to us?

233
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,460
Yeah, well... you know?

234
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,270
We'd be treated as accomplices,

235
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,260
and that's the end of that.

236
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,600
What do you mean, the end of that?

237
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,110
Don't you mean the end of us?

238
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,810
Huh? What do we do then?

239
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,180
Go pole vaulting? In Hawaii or something?

240
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,010
Hey, do you want to die?

241
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,460
Besides, where is this car even headed?

242
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,920
Don't worry about it.

243
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,820
It's probably going to a drug warehouse.

244
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,520
We'll find a link there.

245
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,920
Uh, excuse me.

246
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,950
Where are we going?

247
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,500
[Note: Kamaboko = processed fish meat]

248
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,500
A kamaboko plant.

249
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,830
A kamaboko plant, he said.

250
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,830
Isn't that nice?

251
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,270
I happened to be hungry.

252
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,520
No, it's not!

253
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,500
What exactly did you come here for?

254
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,800
And what kind of business do they
have with a kamaboko plant?

255
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,030
Must be, y'know?

256
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,010
Some kind of new drug that's
made from kamaboko?

257
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,540
We're going to run over the plan
before we reach the site.

258
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,100
Grab as much kamaboko
as you can and run for it!

259
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,750
What plan?!

260
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,370
These people just want
to steal kamaboko!

261
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,990
Okay, we're here!

262
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,500
The kamaboko team gets off here!

263
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,030
The illegal drug team should remain seated
until we reach the warehouse.

264
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,150
Illegal drug team and kamaboko team?

265
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,950
What kind of selection is that?

266
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,150
Hey, get off!

267
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,800
You're on the kamaboko team!

268
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,570
Grab as much kamaboko
as you can and run for it!

269
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,610
Excuse me, I can't stand kamaboko,
so please put me on the drug team.

270
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,240
The sight of that pink layer
makes me want to hurl.

271
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,470
Oh really...

272
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,690
Then I'll grab sasa-kamaboko for you.

273
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,090
[Note: Sasa-kamaboko = white
leaf-shaped kamaboko]

274
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,300
Why are you joining in
the kamaboko raid?!

275
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,730
We managed to get on the drug team.

276
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,620
Hey, why is the kamaboko
team arming up?

277
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,900
Are they planning on risking
their lives for kamaboko?

278
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,200
Hey, what about the drug team...?

279
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,780
Gintoki, are we going to be okay?

280
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,960
Probably.

281
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,880
No, I'm pretty sure we aren't okay.

282
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,130
We're fine.

283
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,530
It's getting hard to do business
around here.

284
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,960
We aren't getting any drugs to sell.

285
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,500
They're all going to Yoshiwara.

286
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,480
The drug business has
moved underground.

287
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:19,610
Lowly thugs like us can't do any business without the
permission of the organizations who run the place.

288
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,810
There's been a change up top.

289
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,330
No, I suppose that the top
was forcibly changed.

290
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,800
In the past, there were constant turf wars
between the various gangs around.

291
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,330
But now, our leaders have all been killed,

292
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,990
so we have to hold hands
and do business

293
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,100
for the same man.

294
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,690
There are this many spider tattoos on
people besides the Benigumoto...

295
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,700
It appears that thieves and Faction members
have been gathered from all over.

296
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,200
The gang we're in is like the company
you'd outsource your grunt work to.

297
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,590
I suppose so.

298
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,870
What could a bunch of kamaboko
thieves be good for?

299
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,260
However...

300
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,000
We've found a lead.

301
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,670
The one single lead that will take us

302
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,960
to the nest of the boss spider.

303
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,260
Who is that man?

304
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,750
No idea.

305
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,720
The top leaders don't even
know his identity.

306
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,400
Different people know him by different
faces and different names.

307
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,120
All we know is that he's crushed
a number of groups by himself.

308
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,720
Using some kind of phantasmagoric
technique...

309
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,950
And his monstrous power...

310
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,830
He used that power to set up a web
on this side in the blink of an eye.

311
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:56,570
Playing detective is fine,
but you oughta be careful.

312
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,240
That man's web is vast and deep.

313
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,230
Step on even one of his threads

314
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,200
and you'll become entangled

315
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,060
and eaten.

316
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,970
Leaving no remains behind.

317
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,380
Shoot! We've been spotted!

318
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,210
Hey, you've gotta be kidding me!

319
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,780
Out of all that crowd,
and from that location?!

320
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,320
He wasn't a common criminal after all.

321
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,760
His sharp detection skill

322
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,420
and his kunai weapon.

323
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,000
A ninja?

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,230
No, his skills are more like a...

325
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,260
Damn! We're completely surrounded!

326
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,660
Baby spiders crawling all over the place.

327
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,250
This is why I hate spiders!

328
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,310
Gintoki, I'll buy us some time!

329
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,250
You return to Yoshiwara and notify
Hinowa and the Hyakka about this!

330
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,680
Don't be joking!

331
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,250
You think I'll leave a girl behind
in a nest full of sleazy men?!

332
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,800
I'm the one staying!

333
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,110
I'm the one who brought
you into this mess.

334
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,020
Go, quickly!

335
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,450
I'll follow behind shortly.

336
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,360
Sorry, but I try not to take a woman's
last minute nonsense seriously.

337
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,020
Stop treating me as a woman.

338
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,890
I've already told you, I've stopped being
a woman along with these scars.

339
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,110
Ha! For someone who screams
over a puff-puff action,

340
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,460
you sure talk big!

341
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,270
Please go, I beg you.

342
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,150
I wish to stay as your equal.

343
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,650
When I'm with you, my resolve weakens.

344
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,500
Give up on being a woman,

345
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,490
Tsukuyo.

346
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,420
Don't shake up my feelings any further.

347
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,110
Pay attention, you idiot!

348
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,720
You're the one

349
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,800
who's not paying attention.

Who the hell are you?!

353
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,200
You don't have a chance against him.

The Original Head of the Hyakka...

I alone will protect you.

Boys and girls across the country,
GinTama Gymnastics are starting!

359
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,330
No, they aren't.

360
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,690
Can you stop trying to jump
on every bandwagon?

361
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,180
Oh, yeah? No good?

362
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,730
No good.
