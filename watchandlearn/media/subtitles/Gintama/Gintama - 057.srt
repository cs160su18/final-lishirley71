00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,520
It looks like you're on time.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,230
Of course. "Trust is No.1" is Aoki and Co.'s motto.

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,730
It holds even truer if you have what we want...

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,450
Sakamoto-sama isn't here?

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,050
Our boss had something to attend to. Anyway, did you bring it?

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,320
Yes. It's over here.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,740
Now what about you?

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,340
Two dozen units of what you ordered. You can verify it yourself.

10
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,190
W-What's this?!

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,330
W-What's going on?!

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,440
What are you doing?! Open the doors immediately!

13
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,620
T-The money! It's gone!!

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,550
What?! The goods are gone.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,120
We've been had...

[Q: Who are the guys that appeared in the opening sequence?]

17

[Q: Who are the guys that appeared in the opening sequence?]
[Tatsuma Sakamoto (left), Mutsu (right)]

18
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,080
[Sorachi-sensei, happy birthday one day early. We'll really go "there" this time.]

["When Looking For Things You've Lost, Remember What You Were Doing On The Day You Lost It"]

20
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,020
Anyway, the goods and the money were stolen.

21
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,130
When we landed on Earth, our boss wandered off and went missing.

22
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,500
You guys, go do something about it.

23
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,480
Do something? Sympathize with you?

24
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,950
Do you want me to make you feel better? You want me to say some kind words?

25
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,710
No, Gin-chan. She wants you to insult her.

26
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,480
She wants you to shower her with bad words. I'm sure of it!

27
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,020
No, she doesn't. This is probably a request.

28
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,350
Not probably. It is a request.

29
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,400
A request? Let me remind you that this is a business.

30
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,300
I won't give you a discount just because we know each other.

31
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,960
I have money.

32
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,570
So what does the job entail?

33
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,040
What a quick change in his attitude!

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,090
Take a look at this.

35
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,840
Okay...

36
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,770
You'll get paid after you finish the job.

37
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,680
Bummer...

38
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,310
What's this?

39
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,210
These are the stolen cargo.

40
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,390
Two dozen Yakuman batteries made from a material extracted

41
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,930
from a special mineral from the planet Nasional.

42
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,200
Batteries?

43
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,450
They're not ordinary batteries.

44
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:06,190
[Battery]

45
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,750
One of these is strong enough to power an entire space battleship.

46
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,400
What do you plan to do with twenty of them?

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,190
It's twenty-four, Gin-san.

48
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:14,650
I want you to retrieve the batteries and the money, find our boss, and return them all to me.

49
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,760
It's easy to say that, but there's hardly any leads to go on?

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,380
Edo is big. It's like trying to find a specific grain of sand in a beach.

51
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,670
They just keep on coming. What is it this time?

52
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,780
If you have something to show us, do it all at once.

53
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,380
The Pleasure Support Club has no idea where they might be.

54
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,760
[Aoki and Co.]
[CEO, President Aoki]

55
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,530
If you're going to ask questions, go to the people we were conducting our trade with.

56
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,090
Oh yes. Also...

57
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,770
If you're ever in trouble, use this.

58
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,770
And when you find our boss, kick him in the balls for me.

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,770
Gin-san, you're going to talk to the company that was part of the trade, aren't you?

60
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,000
No...

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,460
Then where are you going?

62
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,050
I'm going to go kick someone in the balls.

63
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,830
The balls?

64
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,440
Yeah. Sakamoto-san, right? Do you have any idea where he is?

65
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,670
Pretty much.

66
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,360
He's the leader of the Pleasure Support Club,

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,510
so do you think he's gone off to investigate this himself because he feels responsible?

68
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,980
I told you before, didn't I? His head is empty.

69
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,810
Oryo-chan, please marry me!

70
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,670
No, thank you!

71
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,950
You're right. It really is empty.

72
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,150
Looks like I won't have to kick him...

73
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,960
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,870
You're pulling it out! You're pulling it out! You're pulling it out!

75
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,540
[Note: In Japanese, "gin" means "silver" and "kin" means "gold."]

76
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,540
S-S-S-Stop! Stop, Kintoki!

77
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,470
How many times do I need to tell you?!

78
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,440
It's not "kin," it's "gin." How long are you going to keep doing that?

79
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,110
All right! I get it! Let go!

80
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,160
So what do you want with me, Kintoki?

81
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,000
Were you listening to me?

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,050
Wait, Gin-san! We won't get anywhere if we keep at this!

83
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,290
It doesn't matter if he says "kin" or "gin."

84
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,280
This is important. It's going to appear on the test!

85
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,030
If someone called your name, wouldn't you hate it if they said,

86
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,910
"Kagurazaka-chan. Ahahahaha"? You'd hate it, wouldn't you?

87
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,910
[Note: Kagurazaka is in Shinjuku district in Tokyo.]

88
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,650
That really pisses me off.

89
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,070
I didn't say that. I didn't say...

90
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,070
I'm going to kill you!!

91
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,640
I may not look it, but I'm rather busy.

92
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,390
If you don't have any business with me, can I go?

93
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,560
We're here because of you, you bastard!!

94
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,600
Huh? Batteries? I don't know about that...

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,490
They were stolen from you! Weren't they your company's cargo?!

96
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,590
I leave the little things to Mutsu.

97
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,050
There's no use asking me. I don't have any idea at all.

98
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,310
Oh, the pretty lady over there...

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,240
Want to have some fun with me?

100
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,110
No, thank you!

101
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,740
That didn't go well...

102
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,090
Then do you know anything about Aoki and Co.?

103
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,790
Beats me. I don't know about little things.

104
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,790
Anyway, Kintoki, we haven't seen each other in a while.

105
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,830
Let's party at Oryo's place.

106
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,660
Gin-chan, he's trying to bring us back to where we started.

107
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,840
How long are you going to play village idiot with us?

108
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,410
So this is Aoki and Co.

109
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,570
It would be nice if they'd talk to us.

110
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,590
That's why we brought this guy.

111
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,850
Ladies, want to have some fun with me?

112
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,560
No, thank you.

113
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,930
The president of the company you were dealing with is here.

114
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,470
You can do something, right?

115
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,360
W-Wait, ladies...

116
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,900
Well, well, Sakamoto-sama.

117
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,490
It's been quite terrible for both of us, hasn't it?

118
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,880
Let's get down to business.

119
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,630
Do you have any idea who might have attacked you?

120
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,100
Who knows? Our motto is "Trust is No.1."

121
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,380
I don't think we've done anything that would make anyone hold a grudge against us.

122
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,530
But someone attacked you specifically during your transaction.

123
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,380
I can only speculate that information about the trade was leaked ahead of time.

124
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,890
The same goes for both of us. Don't forget that we were also victims.

125
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,510
Even so, we're also investigating the incident at the moment.

126
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,410
I'll let you know if we find something out.

127
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,800
I just don't get it.

128
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,870
We haven't found a single clue since yesterday.

129
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,920
All we found was a good-for-nothing president.

130
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,350
He's more like a plant manager than a president.

131
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,890
Say, Kintoki, I'm tired already. Let's have some sake.

132
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,420
What are you saying? Your Pleasure Support Club asked us to do this.

133
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,360
What's the point in slowing us down? Right, Gin-san?

134
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,930
I'll send the bill to Mutsu. Keep on drinking.

135
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,280
Is it all right to be doing this?

136
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,620
We've got no choice. The client wants us to drink!

137
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,490
That's right. Stop talking about silly things and drink!

138
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,500
No. I'm a minor.

139
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,000
If you can't drink, then eat.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,900
You'll never gain any practical skills by being a malnourished brat.

141
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,550
Another helping of o-chazuke!!

142
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,070
[Note: O-chazuke is rice with tea poured on it.]

143
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,070
You should do some work, too.

144
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,110
We're having a party today. Come on, drink, drink!

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,140
I told you so.

146
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,480
What did you tell me, huh?

147
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,410
Something like, "If you drink sake, don't get drunk."

148
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,430
Then you shouldn't have been drinking in the beginning.

149
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,990
We wouldn't be suffering if we could, right, Kintoki?

150
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,110
Sake is all about drinking and getting drunk over and over.

151
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,680
That's what life is all about.

152
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,900
That's no different from what a gambler who's over his head in debt would say.

153
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,880
In other words, they're hopeless human beings.

154
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,090
In the end, today was a complete waste.

155
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,810
It doesn't look that way.

156
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,570
It looks like it was worth making a lot of noise.

157
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,490
Kintoki, do you still remember?

158
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,550
I'd never forget.

159
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,740
We'll move on my signal.

160
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,990
Okay...

161
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,150
Now!

162
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,450
All right!

163
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,070
What are you doing?!

164
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,920
Something's coming!!

165
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,870
Jeez.

166
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,580
Your skills have gotten rusty. Stand back.

167
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,730
I'll handle this.

168
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,300
Tatsuma...

169
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,020
I'm using this now...

170
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,500
What are you going to do now? If you move one step... Bang!

171
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,050
If you leave quietly, I won't do anything to you.

172
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,630
Amazing. He drove the enemy away without fighting.

173
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,400
We mustn't get into unnecessary fights.

174
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,230
Nothing good will happen whether we win or lose.

175
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,120
Hey...

176
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,810
What are you doing?!

177
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,970
You just let our lead escape, you moron!

178
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,210
B-But no one got hurt, so isn't it all right?

179
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,310
Don't be stupid! We're right back where we started!

180
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,150
You good-for-nothing! Good-for-nothing! Good-for-nothing!!

181
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,200
U-Umm...

182
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,140
What is it?!

183
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,910
We're busy right now!

184
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,440
Oh...

185
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,970
You're from Aoki and Co.

186
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,400
Sorry to interrupt you earlier while you were busy.

187
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,410
So what do you want?

188
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,590
We're irritated right now,

189
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,990
so if it's something frivolous, we're take out our frustrations on him.

190
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,140
[Note: Koshihikari is a type of rice.]

191
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,140
If you want to make us feel better, bring us ten kilos of Koshihikari.

192
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,180
Why are you slipping in a demand for rice?

193
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,910
I want you to hear about some information I obtained concerning what we discussed earlier.

194
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,080
Information?

195
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,400
After conducting our internal investigation,

196
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,090
we've discovered the identity of the organization that wanted those batteries.

197
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,080
So which organization is it?

198
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,130
It's called Evil Organization.

199
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,670
Evil Organization...what?

200
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,170
It's an evil organization that's called "Evil Organization."

201
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:16,410
Evil Organization Ltd.

202
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,740
So this is what's-their-name's... Hideout, huh?

203
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,240
It's "Evil Organization."

204
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,660
It's written in big letters on their sign.

205
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,440
They're a corporation?

206
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,930
And they're in the middle of a field... What should we do, Gin-san?

207
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,800
Don't ask me. It's tiring for me to use up my energy if I don't have to.

208
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,300
Anyway, let's sneak in from the back.

209
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Hello! I'm from Pleasure Support Club!

210
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,310
We just talked about this! Don't do that!

211
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,510
He's as flippant as Mikawaya, our neighborhood liquor store!

212
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,500
Do you want to act stupid that badly? Do you?!

213
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,210
Do you really want to go that far to act stupid?!

214
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,980
What are you saying, Kintoki?

215
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,060
I was just trying to get those batteries back, if they had them...

216
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,070
So you've finally come.

217
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,610
Pleasure Support Club...

218
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,190
You're...

219
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,140
You're that silver-haired guy!!

220
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,990
Gin-chan, do you know him?

221
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,340
No. I don't really remember him.

222
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,930
Are you Isomura-kun, the guy I never gave back the JUMP to?

223
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,080
I never expected to meet you here!!

224
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,910
You're going to pay with interest for what you did to me!!

225
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,480
Looks like they're ready for a fierce battle.

226
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,170
What are we going to do against so many of them?

227
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,860
Well, we'll manage...

228
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,540
Manage? There's so many of them!

229
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,470
Shut up. I said that we'll manage, so we'll manage.

230
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,910
What's with that baseless confidence?!

231
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,290
You may not know, but Tatsuma Sakamoto is monstrously strong.

232
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,190
Huh?

233
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,010
He was pretty famous during the Anti-Foreigner War.

234
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,130
This idiot is strong?

235
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,670
Yeah. He's really strong. Incredibly strong. He's stupid, though.

236
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,670
No way!

237
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,590
Is that idiot stronger than you?

238
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,700
Listen closely. I never said that idiot was stronger than me.

239
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,200
You don't have to keep calling me an idiot. That hurts a lot.

240
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,430
This idiot.

241
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,720
What are you blabbing on about?!

242
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,990
Get them, my minions!!

243
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,730
They're coming!

244
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,390
I guess I have no choice.

245
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,310
I said that I'd be using this now.

246
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,780
What's wrong, Tatsuma?!

247
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,350
I dropped my pistols.

248
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,130
What?! You're so useless!!

249
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,720
Do something, you idiot!

250
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,440
Jeez. Oh well...

251
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,590
Here.

252
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,620
This is...

253
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,020
Your subordinate said to use it.

254
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,130
She probably knew this would happen.

255
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,000
Hmm... This goes here... And this goes here...

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,040
Why are you dismantling it?!

257
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,170
Well, when I was holding it...

258
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,180
He really is an idiot!!

259
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,840
Aww man. Leave that idiot alone.

260
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,350
As expected of the man who crushed our hopes. He's pretty strong.

261
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,080
What should we do?

262
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,600
We have no choice. We're going to use our secret weapon.

263
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,280
Yes...

264
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,530
My, my. We've finally cleaned up.

265
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:22,860
As I expected of you, Silver-hair. I applaud your ability to corner us this far!

266
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,310
What is he talking about?

267
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,720
He sounds pretty arrogant.

268
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,040
Only monkeys and idiots like high places.

269
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,230
Huh? Did you call me?

270
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,750
No, we didn't.

271
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,820
Don't you wonder where your batteries are?

272
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,290
Yes. The batteries are, in a sense,

273
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:49,590
[In a sense, an item that holds enough power to substitute an electric power facility. A true craftsman's piece created through blood, sweat and hard work.]

274
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,040
an item full of so much power that you don't need an electric power facility.

275
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,730
A supreme battery that can only be created by a true craftsman's blood, sweat and hard work!!

276
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,100
Ah. So you do have them after all? If you have them, give them back.

277
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,270
No one's going to give anything back just because they're told to.

278
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,380
Anyway, the fact that we can have a normal conversation means you don't need that megaphone.

279
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,340
You really are an idiot.

280
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,360
Stupid, stupid, stupid! This is no ordinary megaphone.

281
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,380
Watch this and be amazed!

282
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,120
Click.

283
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,390
That's a Justaway!

284
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,880
No, it's not!!

285
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,530
It's our battery-powered ultimate weapon, the Justank!!

286
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,400
Nothing more, nothing less!!

287
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,760
Come on. That's just a rip-off.

288
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,880
The plant manager's going to sue you.

289
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,630
That's copyright infringement.

290
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,290
An evil organization never obeys the laws!!

291
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,640
Click.

292
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,490
Let's go, Justank!!

293
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,840
W-What is this?!

294
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,630
I did it!

295
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,730
I finally completed my secret weapon.

296
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,860
Come on. If you move, I'll fill you with holes.

297
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,870
Huh? No one's here.

298
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,400
You've been doing that all this time?!

299
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,870
Do you understand our current situation?

300
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,380
Wow. That's a big ship.

301
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,480
It's not a ship! It's the enemy!

302
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,110
It's a Justank! It's attacking us!!

303
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,820
What are you doing?!

304
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,590
What's wrong? Are you running away, Kintoki? You're such a coward.

305
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,520
What? Why put it so spitefully? Are we playing chicken? At a time like this?

306
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,260
Leave this to me.

307
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,560
Don't tell me you're going to take on that Justank with a single gun.

308
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,830
Take a look at that. It has something on its forehead, right?

309
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,560
That's...

310
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,740
The battery!

311
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,560
Its weak spot is out in the open!

312
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,240
That's just convenient. Too convenient.

313
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
I'm fine that it's convenient.

314
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,350
If we don't make some cool scenes for me,

315
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,420
this episode will just be an episode about an idiot.

316
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,990
There!

317
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:05,500
[Stand your ground]

318
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,860
"Stand your ground," huh? You got me there.

319
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,650
What is that?! You and your subordinates are all dimwitted!

320
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,510
No, not dimwitted, but rather idiots! They're all idiots!

321
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,440
It's pretty rare to see a pistol that makes a flag come out nowadays!

322
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,100
Don't be impressed by that!

323
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,580
It looks like you're all out of ideas. And so I'm going to finish you off.

324
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,470
What's that?!

325
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,120
That's the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon!

326
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,960
It's got a very high-quality finish.

327
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,460
Another rip-off, huh?

328
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,590
Say whatever you like.

329
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,630
Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon! Fire!

330
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,830
It looks like this is the end for you!

331
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,550
That's...

332
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,290
Beacon coordinates match. They're all safe.

333
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,290
It seems we made it in time.

334
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,220
W-What?

335
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,400
We are the Pleasure Support Club.

336
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,090
The company that Tatsuma Sakamoto leads!

337
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,040
We won't forgive anyone who gets in the way of our business!

338
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,580
W-W-W-W-What should we do?!

339
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,650
Retaliate! Fire, fire!!

340
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,590
W-What?!

341
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,890
You managed to make it in time, Mutsu.

342
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,970
That guy...

343
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,420
Empty?

344
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,460
What is the meaning of this?

345
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,610
Where did you hide them?! Tell us the truth!

346
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,610
I-I really don't know! It was there.

347
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,250
Leaving something as valuable as that lying around while you all fought outside.

348
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,910
That's really dumb.

349
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,290
Someone carried them off while we were fighting.

350
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,800
You probably figured it out already. The hint is..."profit!"

351
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,540
Hurry. Why are you wasting time?

352
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,970
Where are you going in such a hurry?

353
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,540
You're with the Pleasure Support Club?

354
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,380
A night drive? You've got a pretty unsexy companion and truck.

355
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,150
Well, how can I ever thank you for your help?

356
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,560
But we didn't find your money or our cargo.

357
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,620
Well...that's...

358
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,620
Things seem a little too convenient.

359
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,640
Your correct information led us to solve the case.

360
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,120
But we didn't find the money or the cargo.

361
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,960
In that case, who benefited the most?

362
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,970
You have insurance, don't you?

363
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,520
Huh? Yeah...

364
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,210
It's no use playing dumb.

365
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,450
If you lost the money, you'd have the insurance to cover it.

366
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,130
It doesn't hurt you at all.

367
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,960
If the person you hired was crushed, that would be even better.

368
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,900
It would keep them quiet.

369
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,480
W-What?

370
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,740
Everything went according to your plans.

371
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,490
But you made one mistake in the end.

372
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,140
Are you insulting us?!

373
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,020
It's bold of you to act like a good person.

374
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,760
That's how you were able to manipulate us all.

375
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,430
C-Call the police.

376
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,720
Are you sure you want to do that? I think you're the one who's going to be arrested.

377
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,950
Where's your proof?

378
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,890
If you've got the guts to accuse me, you've got to have proof!

379
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,720
Proof.

380
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,750
Proof, huh?

381
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,990
P-President...

382
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,870
We know everything you're up to, idiot.

383
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,700
Thank you for helping us in this matter.

384
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,060
You're annoying. Don't ever bring work to us again.

385
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,050
I'll catch his stupidity if I stay with him too long.

386
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,580
Come to think of it, where's Sakamoto-san?

387
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,090
Our boss? Right about now he's...

388
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,550
Oryo-san, please marry me!

389
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,210
No, thank you!

390
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,390
Judging from the thickness, there's got to be at least three million in here.

391
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,490
They're all thousand yen notes.

392
