2
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,600
I never would have expected
you to bring friends.

3
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,090
Now there's a rare sight.

4
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,090
I figured you were still running
around on your own.

5
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,670
Honestly, you've got a real
knack for making enemies.

6
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,430
Hey, guys.

7
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,460
This fella isn't as bad as people say.

8
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,720
He's just a bit more awkward than most.

9
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,330
Bah, mouthy old hag.

10
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,400
Hey, let's get going.

11
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,300
Huh? Wait, what...

12
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,120
Haven't you had enough to eat?

13
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,650
You're already leaving?

14
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,760
I see that you're as unfriendly as ever.

15
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,020
How many years will pass
before I see you again?

16
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,420
Be careful.

17
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,870
Don't get your balls taken.

18
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,360
If they catch you, you'll never
be able to return to this town.

19
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,640
You there.

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,920
Look after him for me.

21
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,240
["Freedom means to live true
to yourself, not without law!"]

22
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,490
Sorry about the lack of manners
around this place.

23
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,170
Seriously, every one of them looks
ready to bite your head off.

24
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,400
Dogs make much better pets than cats.

25
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,730
Dogs are loyal to their masters and
those eyes just make you want to pet them,

26
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,270
but these freaks don't give a
damn about their masters.

27
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,030
They'll follow anyone if
they get food out of it.

28
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,690
Nobody can tell what they're scheming.

29
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,830
Scary creatures, for real.

30
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,070
Mr. Katsuo...

31
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
Am I to interpret your words
as slander against us?

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,620
Whoops, sorry about that.
No ill intentions.

33
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,680
I was talking about how my Mel-chan
is the cutest in the world.

34
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,990
It appears that the cats in this town have
more spirit than your average stray.

35
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,920
Excellent specimens.

36
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,430
I'm willing to pay double your price.

37
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,110
Man, you for real?

38
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,720
If this is what you want, I can run
out and catch you a buttload.

39
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,990
They're just strays.

40
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,140
The people will rejoice if they're gone.
Nobody will complain.

41
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,570
Well, I doubt that they realize we're
cutting deals behind closed doors.

42
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:16,510
In some places, black cats are
considered to be bad luck,

43
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,890
yet in other places, they are
considered to be good luck.

44
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,080
Cats are creatures with two sides.

45
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,070
You people may consider
them nuisances,

46
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,590
but we consider them messiahs
who will save our planet.

47
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,430
We cannot take action which will
draw attention to us.

48
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,930
Can we count on your cooperation
in assisting our planet?

49
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,810
Bro, how did negotiations go?

50
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,830
Messiahs, my ass.

51
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,360
Cats are scary creatures, for real.

52
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,180
Hey, you hear about the
ball removal mess?

53
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,010
Originally, I heard you'd be released
after they took your balls,

54
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,130
but nobody's come back.

55
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,000
There's a rumor going around
that they even take your soul.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,950
Oh, yeah. I haven't seen
Hoichi around lately...

57
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,310
He couldn't have...

58
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,250
Of course not.

59
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,800
Hoichi's out with that guy again.

60
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,200
The newbie?

61
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,790
Fool! Conceal your presence!

62
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,480
Hey, isn't this bad?

63
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,070
That Gin fella was pretty strong.

64
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,220
If he joins up with Hoichi,
we'll be nothing.

65
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,200
If only he would get caught.

66
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,670
Once he's gone, we'll be free, right?

67
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,660
Guess that's it. We'll call it a day.

68
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,280
Man, you still can't learn to
hunt after all these tries.

69
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,800
You're not gonna be able
to survive in this place.

70
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,520
I-I don't want to learn how to hunt!

71
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,930
How am I supposed to eat
a cute little sparrow?!

72
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,810
I wasn't raised the way you were!

73
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,140
I'm human!

74
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,280
How many times do I have
to tell you this, dimwit?!

75
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,120
Hey! You guys should pitch in!

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,570
Master Hoichi, do you
prefer salt? Or sauce?

77
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,750
Gintoki, what about you?

78
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,690
Oh, I'll have salt...

79
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,720
Wait! You guys adapt too fast!

80
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,370
It appears that they have
what it takes to be strays.

81
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,810
What kind of stray cat would build a fire?!

82
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,040
Hey, Odd Jobs! Come join us!

83
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,950
We can sit around the campfire!

84
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,970
You people can burn into ashes!

85
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,140
Ah, I'm so hungry I can't sleep.

86
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,160
How long am I going to
have to live like this?

87
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,040
When will I turn back to normal?

88
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,000
Shinpachi... Kagura...

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,900
Wonder how they're doing?

90
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,440
Man, you don't know when to give up.

91
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,970
Gin, you can no longer go
back to being human.

92
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,370
Hah, I figured you weren't
listening to my babbling.

93
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,780
You believe my ridiculous story?

94
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,220
Why would I waste my time on
you if I didn't believe you?

95
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,990
Huh?

96
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,800
I wanted to give you advice as someone
who's been down this path,

97
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,680
but I didn't expect you to
be so slow in the head.

98
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,210
D-Don't tell me...

99
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,280
You finally noticed?

100
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,680
No way...

101
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,850
[Note: Doreamon, the robotic cat from the future.]

102
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,220
You're Doraemo-

103
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,720
No!

104
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,850
Not even close!

105
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,100
How could you get Doraemon
from what I just said?!

106
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,240
Well, I figured you meant that
you're a cat from the future.

107
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,310
And perhaps your ears had
been bitten off by mice.

108
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,690
When did I ever say that
I had been bitten by mice?!

109
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,940
When did I ever say that I had
a four-dimensional pocket?!

110
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,930
Huh? So if you aren't Doraemon,
then what?

111
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,320
Could it be that you're Pa-Pa-

112
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,100
Pa-meow?!

113
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,580
It's Pa-man!

114
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,750
[Note: Pa-man, boy superhero manga by the creator of Doraemon.]

115
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,700
Don't change it slightly!

116
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,750
Not even close!

117
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,390
Okay, maybe the chimpanzee, Pa-man 2!

118
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,950
H-Hey, you've gotta be kidding.

119
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,760
Then you...

120
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,540
Why?

121
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,030
[Note: Frieza is a famous villain
from the manga Dragon Ball.]

122
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,190
Why is Lord Frieza here?!

123
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,030
My forehead's the only
thing that's even close!

124
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,120
Can't you tell...?

125
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,730
I used to be a human,
same as you guys.

126
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,610
Huh? Huh?!

127
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,540
Y-You aren't the final
form of Lord Frieza?!

128
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,230
That's what you're surprised about?!

129
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,510
Hold on!

130
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,180
You've been the boss cat around
here for many years, right?

131
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,430
How many years?

132
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,020
How many years have you been a cat?

133
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,480
I turned into a cat thirteen years ago.

134
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,930
So like I said, you can no longer go back.

135
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,750
Well, your curse is probably
different from mine.

136
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,120
You've already given up on
turning back into a human?

137
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,380
This is my penance.

138
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,590
I can't run away.

139
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,850
It is my burden to bear.

140
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,160
I was a lousy bastard even before
I became a cat.

141
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,710
No different from what I am now.

142
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,990
A despicable man who twisted arms and
used force to get what he wanted.

143
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,550
The only difference was that I was a mere
yakuza at the bottom of the chain.

144
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,970
I killed anyone and everyone if ordered.

145
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,810
I took more human lives than
I could possibly count.

146
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,150
It wasn't my fault.

147
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,260
I was a hired gun,
so I didn't have a choice.

148
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,730
I had to make a living.

149
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,750
I shifted all the blame to my employer.

150
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,880
Emptied my mind of thought and
focused on working obediently.

151
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
But one day...

152
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:04,230
I spotted a stray, brilliantly free, so unlike
how I was bound to my employer.

153
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,340
The next thing I knew, I was
feeding him every day.

154
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:17,160
My only freedom during those brutal days
came when I was playing with him.

155
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,030
After that, I could no longer kill people.

156
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,230
After cutting down so many people
without feeling a thing,

157
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,620
my encounter with this small creature
was what taught me the value of life.

158
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,350
I would no longer kill.

159
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,170
That was the promise I made him.

160
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,870
But my employer was
still giving me orders.

161
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,000
A suicide mission for all
intents and purposes.

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,260
He must have noticed that
I had outlived my usefulness.

163
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,120
I was prepared to die.

164
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,470
I would rather die than take another life.

165
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,720
That's how I felt.

166
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,650
The next thing I knew, I was
surrounded by a sea of blood.

167
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,530
I could see a human that resembled
me within that sea of blood.

168
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,420
I broke my promise and
ended up in this form.

169
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,430
Yet he gave me his body
to help me survive.

170
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,750
So I made up my mind.

171
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,550
Until that point, I had taken away many
things that could never be replaced.

172
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,390
But I would use this body,

173
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,780
the precious body he gave me,

174
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,960
to protect those things that
can never be replaced.

175
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,700
My ears may end up tattered, I may be
universally hated, I may end alone,

176
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,460
but I will protect those things
until this body dies.

177
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,350
As I thought.

178
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,460
Your practice of harassing newbies
was to protect those cats.

179
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,120
You attacked them so you could
personally test to see if

180
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,810
they have what it takes to survive
in this brutal Kabukicho.

181
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,470
To avoid needless loss of life...

182
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,070
You ruled through might and fear
to prevent any foolish action,

183
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,170
by the strays,
that would agitate humans.

184
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:31,000
Fear was the only way to control the
foul-tempered cats in this town.

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,950
If you're able to understand
that much, you'll be fine.

186
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,240
I have nothing more to teach you.

187
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,350
I leave the rest to you.

188
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,450
From now on, you lot are
the bosses of Kabukicho.

189
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,730
Huh?!

190
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,600
Don't decide that on your own!

191
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,580
We can't possibly do that!

192
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,750
Yeah! I can't be a boss cat!

193
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,480
Please change that to a boss gorilla!

194
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,500
That isn't the issue here!

195
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,650
You guys should be fine.

196
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,490
I'm too old to hold those ruffians back.

197
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,340
Our relationship with humans deteriorated to
the point where neutering came into practice

198
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,450
because I wasn't able to control them.

199
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,150
What are you saying?!

200
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,820
I'm sure that the cats will have a
change of heart when they learn

201
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,720
how you've sacrificed yourself
to protect them!

202
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,850
You are the only one who can
serve as boss cat in this town!

203
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,720
I was never boss cat material.

204
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,050
But there's still something
this old body can do.

205
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,130
Don't tell me...

206
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,990
You're going to save the ones
who've been caught?!

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,290
Hoichi, you seem to be having
fun with your new friends.

208
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,250
Let us join in on the fun.

209
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,190
Bastards, what's the meaning of this?

210
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,490
Hoichi, you've done a fine job of
running roughshod all over us.

211
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,620
But that ends today!

212
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,530
We'll beat you up and turn
you into the neighborhood association.

213
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,720
This town doesn't need a boss.

214
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,580
We're gonna live free!

215
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,770
An uprising?

216
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,730
Enough!

217
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,080
Do you fools have any idea
how Master Hoichi has...

218
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,100
Zip it!

219
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,060
Beat the crap out of them all!

220
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,210
Don't let a single potential
boss cat get away!

221
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,600
Run for it.

222
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,550
I'm leaving the rest to you.

223
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,150
Hoichi!

224
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,180
Saves me the trouble.

225
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:45,040
I was on my way to see the dumb faces
on the cats who've been caught.

226
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,530
Now, show me the way.

227
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,420
What?! He's completely ignoring us!

228
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,330
Wh-Why doesn't he fight back?!

229
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,190
D-Don't be scared! Flatten him!

230
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,650
Wait, Gintoki!

231
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,250
A fine haul!

232
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,210
Not sure what's going on,
but we're in luck!

233
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,340
Got them all in one go!

234
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,570
Shoot!

235
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,630
We made too much noise and
the humans noticed us!

236
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,280
What are you doing?!
Get the heck out of here!

237
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,530
Hoichi!

238
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,320
The Gutter Rat Gang is apparently behind the
project to capture Kabukicho strays.

239
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,830
They told the townspeople that they were neutering
the cats to prevent an infestation,

240
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,990
when they were actually selling them
off to Planet Catnip's embassy.

241
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,990
And none of the cats they've
captured have returned.

242
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,750
Thought so.

243
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,050
I knew that something was up.

244
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,470
I heard that they were on
the hunt again last night.

245
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,680
A large number of strays
were caught.

246
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,300
This town's looking pretty clean now.

247
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,580
Otose-san, we assisted with the project
to reduce the number of bad cats

248
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,200
so humans and cats would have
an easier time living in this town.

249
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,490
But this is...

250
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,870
A town without a single stray cat...

251
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,360
I wouldn't call this clean.

252
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,170
Let's crash 'em!

253
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,500
Crash the embassy and save the strays!

254
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,190
And Gin-chan might have been
caught up in their conspiracy!

255
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,520
Forget it.

256
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,480
We're dealing with an embassy here.

257
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,440
One wrong move and you
won't be getting off lightly.

258
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,950
But!

259
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,850
There's no need to worry.

260
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,230
You think this is enough to
get rid of the strays

261
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,610
who've managed to
survive in this town?

262
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,820
Don't do anything foolish.

263
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,950
This is their territory.

264
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,450
Cats have their own sense of honor.

265
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,510
We can still turn back.

266
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,930
This won't help us return
to our original bodies.

267
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,500
We might die.

268
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,950
As cats.

269
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,440
Didn't you hear Hoichi?

270
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,940
I'm leaving the rest to you.

271
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,210
If we're all taken out,
who's going to replace Hoichi?

272
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm a gorilla, as you can see.

273
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,010
I could never be a boss cat.

274
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,720
So I have no obligation
to keep that promise.

275
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,550
My apologies to Master Hoichi,

276
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,550
but I have no intention of living
as a cat or dying as a cat.

277
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,510
I will live as a samurai,
and die as a samurai.

278
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,350
It doesn't matter if we're cat or gorilla.

279
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,390
We fight for our friends.

280
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,950
That is the samurai way.

281
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,450
Is that so?

282
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,450
Hoichi, as of today, we'll take over your
title as the king of Kabukicho strays.

283
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,900
We'll stake everything we have
to protect the things

284
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,460
you've staked everything to protect.

285
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,500
The Kabukicho Boss Cat Alliance!

286
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,310
On the scene!

287
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,610
They were caught in a pitfall.

288
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,330
I wonder how they escaped.

289
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,200
And why is there a gorilla?

290
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,780
Did we ever catch a gorilla?

291
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,550
A-All according to plan.

292
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,440
Right...

293
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,620
We've successfully infiltrated
the enemy base...

294
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,230
Y-Yeah... Just as planned...

295
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,140
So what do we do now?

296
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
Help!

297
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,410
I'm a gorilla! Not a cat!

298
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,590
This has nothing to do with me!

299
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,320
No!

300
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,260
I don't want to die with these fools!

301
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,520
Keep it down!

302
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,610
After all that big talk,
you breakdown eight scenes later?!

303
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,180
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, gorilla?!

304
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,210
We should all be ashamed after talking
big and walking into that pitfall!

305
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,390
Why's that? I'm not ashamed at all!

306
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,810
It was all according to plan!

307
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,730
I'm not worried at all!

308
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,040
This isn't the time to fight
amongst ourselves.

309
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,890
We must escape at once,

310
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,110
or we're done for,
let alone save Master Hoichi.

311
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,870
Look at his belt.

312
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,750
We must grab those keys.

313
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,790
Listen up.

314
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,430
Once a cat squeezes his head
through the bars, he's free.

315
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,690
Zura, you should have a chance
with that tiny brain of yours.

316
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,640
Fortunately, nobody will care
if you crack anything.

317
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,080
I will!

318
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,050
Just get going. We have no time.

319
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,210
Hey! I'm saying that it's impossible!

320
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,160
I said to get going!

321
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,230
He's out! His body's out!

322
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,410
Hey! What am I supposed to do now?!

323
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,220
My neck is stuck tight!

324
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,300
I'll suffocate if my legs fall behind!

325
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,820
Keep it down! They'll notice!

326
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,140
You just need to get your head out!

327
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,920
Push harder! Come on!

328
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,910
Easy for you to say!

329
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,450
Huh? Is something stuck?

330
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,900
My tail! My tail is caught in
the automatic door!

331
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,870
That's weird. It won't move.

332
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,940
Dying!

333
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,850
My head's gonna come off!

334
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,270
Out! Get out!

335
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,990
You have to get that head out if you want
to survive! There's no other way!

336
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,530
I'm dying!

337
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,030
You're going to kill me before
my head ever pops out!

338
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,210
Pretend like you're the
Tom in Tom and Jerry!

339
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,230
You can do it!

340
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,250
You can match Tom!

341
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,290
Flatten yourself and slip on through!

342
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,810
H-He's free!

343
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,360
Well done, Zura!

344
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,510
Grab the key and open us up!

345
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,570
You okay? Still got your tail?

346
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,380
Yeah, my tail is fine.

347
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,750
Why is my tail out?!

348
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,140
Why mine instead of yours?!

349
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,760
Sorry, I grabbed it when I was in pain.

350
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,130
Sorry, my ass!

351
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,540
Why did you have to pull my tail out?!

352
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,180
What?! When did you...

353
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,720
Hey! Don't use my tail like that!

354
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,860
Now's our chance. Get out.

355
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,690
Why are you using it like a beam saber?!

356
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,250
What's going on with that thing?!

357
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,890
And we didn't even need the key!

358
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,850
Give that back!

359
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,020
I'll use it!

360
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,790
Our materials are escaping!
Catch them!

361
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,440
There's also a gorilla!
What's going on?!

362
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,910
Bah, more of them.

363
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,980
Gintoki, you go on ahead!

364
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,500
I'll hold them here!

365
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,170
Don't pull out your tail like
it's completely normal!

366
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,850
Bah, I have no choice.

367
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,110
Odd Jobs, you owe me one.

368
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,150
Bring it on, scum!

369
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,610
I'll show you the power of the Force!

370
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,690
What the hell are you using?!

371
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,200
That's got nothing to do with the Force!

372
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,600
That's just your dirty hose!

373
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,530
What are you doing?! Hurry up!

374
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,810
We're leaving the rest to you, Odd Jobs!

375
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,840
Grant the stray cats of Kabukicho!

376
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,680
And their proud king!

377
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,200
True freedom!

378
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,910

380
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,810
Hoichi, you're just like him.

381
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,430
I once picked up another stray
who was just like you.

382
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,650
The next episode...
