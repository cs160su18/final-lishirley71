00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,900
I'm sorry... I promise I'll come back for you.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,820
Sorry... I'm sorry...

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,340
Hey, hey, hey! Goemon, a member of the teen-idol group Hansamu, had a shotgun marriage.

5
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,840
This is rotten.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,440
Really, this world has gone rotten. Cohabitation or shotgun marriages... People are losing their morals.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,160
No, that's not what I meant. There's something in here that looks like mold.

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,420
This is mold, right?

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,280
Indeed.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,310
It may be a moldy and outdated way of thinking,

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,060
but if we lose our discipline, it'll be the end of humanity.

12
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,100
No, that's not what I meant.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,400
When did you buy this? Isn't it past the expiration date?

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,130
Right!

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,970
Women are too sensitive about their "expiration" date! They shouldn't sell themselves so cheap.

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,760
Hey, cut it out. This is rotten. Who bought this?

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,710
It really is rotten!

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,220
You bet they are. Your brains are rotten.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,910
Boy, they just don't listen anymore.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,320
Especially Shinpachi, sometimes I feel he looks at me with contempt.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,370
Maybe I should beat him into submission. Kagura...?

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,020
With her, it's the opposite--she'd beat me up.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
[This is your child. Please raise him. I am exhausted and can no longer care for him.]

24
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,540
No. No way. This isn't happening.

25
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,340
Really. It's so ridiculous.

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,090
No way. That was just... Right...

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,550
It's all right. This can't be happening...

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,380
No, no, no, no, no! No way! This can't be happening! Not happening!

29
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,310
There's no way this is happening to me right now. Uh-uh! No way!

30
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,540
I said...!

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,070
Shut up, you idiot! It's too early for your crap!

32
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,070
[A naturally wavy-haired baby was left in front of Odd Jobs.]

["Milk Should Be Served at Body Temperature"]

35
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,340
You're rotten...

36
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,270
You really are...

37
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,520
I always knew you were good-for-nothing,

38
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,400
but I didn't think you could be so thoughtless as to plant a seed and just move on.

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,820
But I always got a "5" in PE. So, I know how to control myself.

40
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,890
[Note: School subjects in Japan are evaluated by numbers, 5 being the highest, like an "A".]

41
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,890
Well, this has nothing to do with PE.

42
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,920
Don't act stupid. His hair is soft like a cat's and wavy.

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,300
And that arrogant expression, too. Obviously inherited from you.

44
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,700
You're saying I passed on the naturally wavy hair trait? I'd never lay a trap like that on my own kid!

45
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,210
I'd make a silky straight-haired kid, even if it meant untwisting my genes!

46
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,400
Come on!

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,680
Stop talking so loud. The baby will cry! Right, Silver J. Fox?!

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,990
Can you stop it? Can you stop calling him by that name?

49
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,490
I bet his young mom just left him to go play pachinko. How annoying!

50
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,480
Mr. Naturally-wavy hair is trying to dodge his responsibility.

51
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,590
He just doesn't know when to admit the truth, right, Ginraku?

52
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,590
[Note: Ginraku is written from the "Gin" in Gintoki and the "gura" in Kagura]

53
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,600
[Note: Many comic storytellers have a name that contains "raku."]

54
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,600
Will you stop it?! Stop calling him by that comic storyteller's name!

55
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,110
Oh, this is bad!

56
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,510
He's getting cranky.

57
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,720
Did he poop in his pants or what?

58
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,610
It doesn't look like it. He just wants some milk.

59
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,580
Someone! Does anyone have breast milk?

60
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,900
Let me try. I feel like some might come out now.

61
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,030
No way!

62
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,320
Why are you bringing out your motherly instincts all of sudden?!

63
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,280
It might come out of mine. In fact, I've had an upset stomach since yesterday.

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,350
That's not where milk's made! That's called diarrhea!

65
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,990
He's drinking!

66
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,950
He really is!

67
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,000
Wow, he's sucking really well! It's like he's real!

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,620
Hey! Don't let her carry the baby anymore.

69
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,180
Hey! Let me try it, too!

70
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,310
You're too young! Come back in a hundred years!

71
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,290
These days, men can take better care of babies!

72
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,160
Leave it to me as the old woman! Old women are really good at this kind of thing.

73
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,110
Hey, hey...

74
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,250
This is not good.

75
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,060
Everyone looks so happy...

76
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,640
It never hurts to have one of these either. Really, what a troublesome baby.

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,330
Really... That's why I hate little brats.

78
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,530
Peek-a-boo!

79
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,650
What? He isn't laughing at all.

80
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,310
It seems... They're all going gaga over him.

81
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,060
All right, Kintoki. Don't become a loser like your father.

82
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,120
Mantoki. Look over here, Mantoki.

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,260
Ginraku. It's your mother, Ginraku.

84
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,280
Sakata. Idiot Sakata.

85
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,850
All these names are derived from my name!

86
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,210
Ah! Where are you going?!

87
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,570
That bastard! I wonder if he's going to abandon him again...

88
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,560
Over my dead body!!

89
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
Um...

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,570
Excuse me.

91
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,220
I'd like to ask you something...

92
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,070
An abandoned child?

93
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,940
Right. I'll leave the rest up to you guys, the police. Please take care of it.

94
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,600
Hey, hey... Are you kidding me, Mister?

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,720
You and this boy are like two peas in a pod. He's even got those dead fish eyes of yours.

96
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,710
Don't you know? Nowadays, all brats are like that.

97
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,440
It's because they're obsessed with video games and the Internet, and they don't play outside.

98
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,380
It's a really sick era.

99
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,640
Anyway, I don't know with whom you made this kid. Aren't you a stud, Mister?

100
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,960
Okita-kun. Mister is over here. You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?!

101
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,430
Well, Mister... It means you must reap what you sowed.

102
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,080
Anyway,

103
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,510
I'm busy with official business, so let's just wrap this up.

104
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,020
Why am I surrounded by people who won't listen to my story?

105
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,920
Do we look so much alike? The two of us?

106
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,020
Oh? Gin-san?

107
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,660
Are you working now? You really do work hard.

108
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,050
O-Oh... Well... That's right...

109
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,950
Babysitting... I mean, I was asked to do something like...

110
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,330
See-ya

111
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,530
Hey, wait, Gin-san!

112
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,930
One Azuki Bar and Baagen-Dash, please.

113
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,160
We don't usually have such fancy ice cream.

114
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,160
Well, don't mind us...

115
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,840
They have it at the convenience store, don't they?

116
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,540
I'll go buy it.

117
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,180
It's all right. Seriously!

118
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,680
I gotta get outta here! If she finds out, I'm not sure what she'll do!

119
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Ah, Gin-san!

120
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,690
I said

121
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,530
wait!!

122
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,650
[Note: "Daina bomb" is a play on the word "dainagon" which is a kind of red bean sweet.]

123
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,650
Daina bomb?

124
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,440
Ah...

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,730
Hey... Are you all right?

126
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,200
I see...That was it... You two were...a couple...

127
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,200
I feel so stupid... I didn't know anything... I was the only one...

128
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,970
I was like...a buffon...

129
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:24,810
You played with my feelings and strung me along... While you two were busy making a baby together.

130
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,150
Sarutobi-san, what are you talking about? I'll knock your brains out.

131
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,420
That's enough. It really is! I look so stupid. I really do!

132
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,130
You don't "look stupid," you are stupid! You really are stupid, aren't you?

133
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,370
No matter how much disdain you show for me, I don't feel good anymore!

134
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,950
Our little S&M game is over!!

135
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,830
When did I ever do S&M with you?

136
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,410
You two have tons of children and have a big family!

137
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,800
And live in a house with many holes in the paper sliding doors!

138
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,840
[Note: Kids love to poke holes in paper sliding doors.]

139
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,840
Good-bye! Best wishes, whatever!

140
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,350
But...

141
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,000
I won't let you do that!

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,970
Oh, please, you're a one-woman soap opera! You're a B-movie script!

143
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,490
I pity you, Otae-san.

144
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,090
The moment a woman gives birth, she isn't seen as a woman anymore! She's just a family member!

145
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,800
You're no longer a woman!

146
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,050
You've taken yourself out of the competition! Way to go!

147
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,610
What kind of battle are you talking about?!

148
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,850
I said I didn't give birth! Who wants to have a child with that pathetic samurai?!

149
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,180
Then how do you explain that boy? He looks just looks like him! His natural wavy hair and eyes!

150
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,700
He's just like him!

151
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,510
I really don't know! At least I'm sure he's not my child!

152
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,990
Right, Gin-san? Say something to her!

153
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,200
Like father, like son!!

154
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,730
That's your bastard child all right. And you call yourself a samurai? For shame.

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,400
I'll make Shin-chan quit his job. Let's go, Sarutobi-san.

156
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,720
Why? Why won't anybody around here listen to me?

157
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,630
Because you never listen to other people.

158
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,310
Oh...I see...

159
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,320
I'm sorry, but I don't know. I've never seen a lady like this before.

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,710
I see.

161
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,120
Oh, I'm sorry. I was so forward. I still haven't introduced myself.

162
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm Kahei Hashida. I run a store here in Kabukicho.

163
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,050
Huh? That big corporation?

164
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,130
What's that?

165
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,240
You see? You can see it from the Yorozuya. That huge building!

166
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,810
So, what happened?

167
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:31,250
Well... The other day, my one and only precious grandson suddenly disappeared.

168
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,810
A kidnapping?

169
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:39,340
I don't know for sure, but he just started walking, so he probably...

170
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,350
I have reason to believe that lady in the photograph was involved.

171
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,710
A beautiful lady, like this?

172
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,760
Did you report it to the police?

173
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,540
Well, the circumstances are a bit complicated, so I don't want to make this matter public.

174
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,000
But under the circumstances, you really shouldn't be worried about your privacy.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,500
Right... That's probably true, but...

176
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,890
Please... If you see this lady, just contact me.

I'm asking for your cooperation. And here's a photo of my grandson...

Excuse me. Is anybody here?

Hey, over here. How can I help you?

Ah...

181
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,390
I feel like I've lost my confidence. Hey, you. You're not really my son, are you?

182
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,900
Where're your real parents? Please release me from this responsibility.

183
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,610
Call your father. Say "Daddy."

Remember who you are!

193
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,930
Hey, hey. Aren't you going a little overboard? She can't speak unless you stop that!

194
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,640
Forgive me. I got too worked up.

195
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,780
But from now on, it's a family matter, so we'll deal with it ourselves.

196
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,150
I'm sorry...

This is the person the old man was looking for.

A photo of his grandson.

Kidnapping? What? Who? Where?

It's useless. Don't play dumb.

You're that woman's lover or something, aren't you?

Hey, you! What are you talking about?

215
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,130
I was told to capture the suspect alive, but it doesn't matter. It's a man. Kill him.

Hey, hey, hey! I'm not your problem!

I just found this kid outside my door. I do odd jobs! I don't know the first thing about kidnapping!!

218
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,190
Then give us that baby back!

I don't know anything about it!

Catch him!!

You have an interesting fighting technique.

229
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,060
I wonder if you must be used to fighting to protect someone.

230

Dangerous people like you can't raise a child. Get out of my way. It's time for his milk.

Good ...You're good.

232
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:15,410
The smell of the beast... You can't hide it. You smell like the beast and so does that brat.

233
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,570
It's no fun fighting a one-armed opponent. I'll let you go.

Oh, dear!

238
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,020
It's so dirty! I wonder why men always dirty the urinal like this.

239
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,340
Especially on the left side.

240
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,080
I hear most men point left.

241
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,680
It's rare for men to point right, and it's the sign that they'll become the ruler of the kingdom.

242
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,640
They say Toyotomi Hideyoshi pointed to the right.

Oh, my! My husband points to the right. He'll become the ruler!

Toilets are disgusting lately too. It's like, "Which way do their butt-holes face?"

I know, huh? It's probably those ronin our master hired.

246
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,200
Really. Don't they know how to use a toilet?! I don't know if they're exclusionist rebels or what, but come on.

247
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,530
And who knows what our master is up to behind the scenes.

248
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,930
The rumor is his grandson, Kanshichiro-sama, was kidnapped.

249
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,010
I wonder if he was involved in some bad business.

250
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,750
You're wrong. It heard Ofusa did it.

Huh? Is that so? Oh, no! That lady would do something like that?

252
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,170
Well, after she was treated so badly, it couldn't be helped. Because she...

253
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,580

Kya! It's Hasegawa, the new guy!

Stop saying "Kya!" It doesn't sound cute, you old hags!

Damn it!

262
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,840
I shouldn't have taken this job as a janitor! There aren't any hot little maids here!

263
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,070
There're only old women!

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,440
Hey! Just keep walking.

265
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,110
Huh?

266
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,820
That is...the girl those old women were just talking about...

267
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,070
Hey, hey... This isn't the sort of place I should stay too long.

268
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,290
But what are you going to do if you quit this job? Are you going back to your loafer life?

269
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,700
That's right. I'm always like this.

270
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,600
When I come across something I don't like, I quit. Escaping is becoming my habit.

271
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,130
That's right. He's a totally useless man, a DORK. He oughta kill himself.

272
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,920
No, no, no. That's messed up. Why do I have to kill myself?

273
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,340
That wasn't right. I mean, death's no trip to Kyoto.

274
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,080
No, no, no. You'd better die. There won't be anything good in your future if you live, uh-huh.

275
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,420
"Uh-huh..." What? Huh?

276
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,660
What are you doing, you guys?!

277
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,820
Are you the one adding the weird narration and filling my head with such suicidal thoughts?!

278
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,670
Why are you here?!

279
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,430
We're housekeepers.

280
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,800
How about you? What are you doing here? Did you change jobs again?

281
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,560
What do you mean "again"?! Why are you giving me that look?!

282
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,740
Oh, well. Good timing. Hasegawa-san, can you show us around?

283
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,090
Show you around?

Damn him! Where did he go?

285
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,590
He can't be far away! Find him!

286
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,160
Hey, they're gone.

287
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,030
I said they're gone.

288
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,370
I said they're gone!

289
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,900
There's no way I can hide in there!

290
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,440
Oh! You were hiding over there, after all.

291
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,180
Whatever. There's no way I could hide in there! Are you stupid? I bet you are.

292
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,650
I'm not stupid, I'm Katsura!

293
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,500
Gintoki, they're probably exclusionist ronin.

294
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,910
And the Hashidaya they mentioned is one of the biggest corporations in Edo.

295
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,380
Do you know anything about it?

296
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,380
Kahei Hashida is a dangerous man.

297
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,110
He supports the exclusionist ronin so he can move them around behind the scenes.

298
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,900
That's why he became so powerful. It's not just an ordinary businessman.

299
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,670
Why did a man like that's grandson come to me?

300
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,980
I guess you did "nyan nyan" with one of the girls at Kahei's place.

301
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,190
I already told you, I didn't! And what's "nyan nyan"?

302
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,570
That's an outdated word! Did you mean Yuyake?

303
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,860
Anyway, look at his arrogant face. He's definitely identical to you!

304
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,470
It's the job of a baby to cry. But you're ignoring your duties, slacker?!

305
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,460
What kind of childcare is that?!

306
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,040
You've got to be kidding! If he starts crying now...

307
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,350
Well, I'd just throw him into the river.

308
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,160
Oh, yeah. The only time a man should cry is if his hair's permed too tight.

309
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,200
You have good prospects in that area.

310
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,710
Even more than Shinpachi.

311
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,950
Hey, Gintoki... Look down.

312
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,860
Huh?

313
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,810
It looks like his upper part is all right, but his lower part gets wet easily.

314
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,160
Hey, hey! This is bad!

315
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,230
It doesn't look like the old man of Hashidaya is a harmless old businessman!

316
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,920
He's more like a dangerous man with a dark rumor!

317
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,280
Let's go home! Let's go home with this old man! I'll buy you some pickled seaweed!

318
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,890
I can't turn back now after hearing that.

319
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,180
As I thought, there's got to be something going on behind the scenes.

320
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,580
You thought I was some kind of hussy you could buy with pickled seaweed, huh, bastard?!

321
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,300
How many? How much pickled seaweed were you going to offer me?

322
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,180
Don't tell me four! You were not going to give me only four?!

323
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,440
Kagura-chan, please be quiet.

324
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,510
Is this the place? Is this the room they brought that woman to?

325
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,180
Hey, how many?! Just say it. It's not like I'm interested or anything...

326
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,050
[Diaper]

327
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,090
Oh, yours points to the right. You'll become somebody big in the future. Good for you!

328
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,310
What? What? Don't feel bad about wetting your pants.

329
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,300
Those parts of a man have a will of their own. Something like this can happen.

330
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,500
There you go.

331
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,130
Really...

332
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,500
I was mistaken for a dad and for a kidnapper... Today is my unlucky day.

333
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,180
Oh, sorry, sorry. It's your unlucky day, too. We've both got it rough, don't we?

334
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,010
Oh, well. But as long as we're alive, there'll be days like this. For you...

335
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,020
...there'll be many more hardships in life.

336
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,940
Eighty percent of life is made up of hardships.

337
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,000
Seriously...

338
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,220
Stuff like this happens to me all the time.

339
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,830
But it's not all bad.

340
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,970
At the end of a day like today, sake tastes great.

341
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,700
When everything is over, shall we have a drink together?

342
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,480
All right... Shall we go?

343
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,440
Come on! Spill it, already!

344
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,530
Where's Kanshichiro-sama? You'll be released of your responsibility if you tell us.

345
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,420
Hey! Say something!

346
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,380
What a stubborn woman.

347
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,690
I have no idea why Kantaro loves this slutty, flithy woman.

348
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,190
You seduced my son and killed him.

349
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,710
And you abducted his child... You, wicked woman!

350
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,050
You guys are the ones who abducted Kanshichiro.

351
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,010
He's my son. I won't let anyone take him from me!

352
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,440
It's a shame a woman like you bore a child from the Hashida family.

353
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,440
Kanshichiro doesn't need a mother. I'll raise him as a son and true heir.

354
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,510
If you won't say anything...

355
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,850
We'll have to get physical...

356
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,950
This is bad, Hasegawa-san.

357
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,050
Hey, what are you doing there?

358
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,970
Housekeepers?

359
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,060
Um... That's right. Th-These two are the new housekeepers...

360
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,840
So I'm showing them around the building.

361
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,120
That's right, master.

362
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,200
Well, we're not your "master."

363
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,010
What? I thought men like to hear that kind of word, don't they?

364
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,100
No, no, Kagura-chan! No! Don't say that!

365
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,020
Then, please excuse me...

366
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,940
Wait.

367
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,180
It stinks. I smell a lying spy with the stench of a rat.

368
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,540
I seem to be smelling a lot of odd things today.

369
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,110
But right now I'm in the mood for the smell of blood and steel!

370
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,450
Will you fight...

371
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,500
...Nizo, the butcher?

372
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,540
What's the meaning of this?

373
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,610
Sorry to interrupt your fun.

374
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,870
But I just found some suspicious rats.

375
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,110
Huh? I saw you guys at Otose-dono's place.

376
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,230
Oh, my! You followed me here. You're nosy people.

377
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,120
I told you this was a personal matter, so I don't need your help.

378
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,380
Don't worry. We came here for something personal, too.

379
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,040
By the way, Don't you think you're going too far even for a devoted grandfather, Kahei-san?

380
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,210
You guys are more than just nosy.

381
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,500
There are things you're better off not knowing about in this world.

382

384
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,110
Are you asking me if I made an "apo?"

385
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,290
What's an "apo"? Huh? Could it be a fruit from the northern area, like a "Fuji Apple"?

386
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,900
The next episode... "If You Want to Meet Someone, Get an Appo First."
