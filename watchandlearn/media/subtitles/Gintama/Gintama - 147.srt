00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,650
I see you're working hard, Shin-chan.

3
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,940
Ah, Sis.

4
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,660
Sorry about making such a racket with my swishing.

5
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,180
Did I wake you up?

6
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,950
Well, I'd call that swooshing instead of swishing...

7
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,120
But it's fine.

8
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,330
Don't mind me. Continue.

9
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,850
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

10
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,090
Shin-chan.

11
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,560
That's not the issue here.

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,720
Changing your cry won't accomplish anything...

13
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,180
I want to become stronger...

14
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,810
Stop!

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,100
Stop!

16
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,320
So I'm not the one being protected all the time...

17
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,100
So I can protect everyone else!

18
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,020
...I don't have use for weaklings.

19
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,270
Big...!

20
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,100
I want to become stronger...

21
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,280
I'll protect Kagura!

22
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,810
I'll protect the Kagura we believe in!

23
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,040
So I won't lose to Kamui... or myself...

24
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,310
[Stronger]

25
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,050
Stronger!

26
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,000
We...

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,370
...want to become stronger.

28
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,300
"All Adults are Instructors for All Children."

29
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,500
Yeah? Then do it.

30
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,890
Good luck.

31
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,100
That's all you have to say?

32
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,610
Wait, weren't you listening to our monologue before the episode title?

33
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,350
I mean... we had that serious look and all...

34
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,260
Building up to a whole training arc thing after running into enemies stronger than anything we've seen...

35
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,040
What training arc?

36
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,410
That's what you guys are about to start?

37
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,660
Sounds rough.

38
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,220
No, not that.

39
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,910
Isn't there some kind of special training... you know?

40
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,160
That you can teach us...?

41
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,580
That's right!

42
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,930
You need to do some training too, Gin-chan.

43
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,680
We've got lots of tough enemies coming up.

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,200
We...

45
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,480
...want to become stronger.

46
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,610
And so, three months passed.

47
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,210
Man, that was some tough training.

48
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,280
Three months haven't passed!

49
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,740
Only three seconds have passed!

50
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,370
It's good to be home.

51
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,720
Why does your narration make it sound like you've been training?!

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,340
Don't worry.

53
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,060
The flow of time here and there is different.

54
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,100
A month over there isn't even a second over here.

55
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,160
Where is over there?!

56
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,470
You're making no sense at all!!

57
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,610
It means that in three seconds here,

58
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,770
we were able to reap the benefits of training three months over there.

59
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,520
We never moved an inch from here!

60
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,300
And where is over there for crying out loud?!

61
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,770
[Note: Room of Spirit and Time - Training space that appears in the Dxxxxn Baxx series.]

62
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,470
Since when did we train in the Room of Spirit and Time?!

63
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,770
What's wrong with that?

64
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,060
Let's just say we got it over with.

65
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,690
It's such a pain.

66
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,560
I don't wanna do any training.

67
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,300
It's such a pain.

68
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,220
He just said something a JUMP main character would never say!

69
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,320
He doesn't have a shred of ambition!

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,430
Have you forgotten the three principles of JUMP?!

71
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,220
Friendship!

72
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,220
[Friendship]

73
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,930
[Effort]

74
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,930
Effort!

75
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,100
Victory!

76
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,020
[Victory]

77
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,290
You can't have victory without effort!

78
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,450
You can't defeat stronger rivals if you have no ambition!

79
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,880
No way...

80
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,460
Sounds like a pain.

81
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,470
Cause I mean, y'know...

82
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,140
It's a pain.

83
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,700
Nothing's more painful than, y'know...

84
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,720
For example...

85
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,430
Man, this is a pain.

86
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,490
Giving an example is a pain.

87
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,100
How much pain are you in?!

88
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,600
Besides, did you plan out a basic outline for your training?

89
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,340
You're both saying that just 'cause everyone's doing it, right?

90
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,720
You just wanted to talk about training.

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,760
If you think that training will make this show more JUMP-like, you're wrong.

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,510
They're them. We're us.

93
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,050
If you want to train that badly, you can go live in some other anime.

94
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,920
Mom?!

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,970
You're saying things like a mom when you're just a lazy bum!

96
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,570
Besides, the whole "Friendship, Effort, Victory" thing is so old-school.

97
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,870
Stop clinging to a slogan from dozens of years ago.

98
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,370
The world has moved on.

99
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,940
Ibaragi is dead.

100
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,990
[Note: This is referring to Masahiko Ibaragi - Former editor-in-chief of Shonen JUMP]

101
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,990
He hasn't died yet!

102
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,440
He's working hard as the editor-in-chief for JUMP SQ!

103
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:31,600
[Note: JUMP SQ is a Monthly JUMP magazine targeted for older teens and young adults.]

104
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,750
Besides, a training arc just consists of boring tasks.

105
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,600
That's not going to get you ratings.

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,680
And it's tiring for us, too.

107
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,260
The ones that can get away with stuff like that,

108
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,940
are shows with flashy special attacks and effects...

109
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,940
[Note: Example used here is from Dxxxxn Baxx's Kamehameha]

110
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,350
Or the training itself is innovative. It only works for a select few.

111
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,350
[Note: Example used here is from JxJx's Bxxxxxe Adventure Part 2 training.]

112
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,260
It's an area beyond our reach.

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,790
This guy's despicable.

114
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,430
He's bringing up shady topics just because he doesn't want to train.

115
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,870
Or what?

116
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,390
You two have an innovative, yet visually stunning training method in mind?

117
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,810
Of course you don't!

118
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,310
You just want to train, right?

119
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,790
I do too!

120
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,570
I do have an actual plan!

121
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,940
Oh? Then let me hear it.

122
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,980
First, we do that...

123
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,410
Camp out in the mountains.

124
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,610
Typical.

125
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,060
And? What do you do there?

126
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,800
That thing, uh...

127
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,180
With bears.

128
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,410
Where you fight bears to hone your natural instincts?

129
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,580
That's old.

130
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,520
That idea's been done to death.

131
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,700
Where it holds your feet as you do sit-ups.

132
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,770
Use the bear more effectively!

133
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,580
How can you use a bear that way?!

134
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,880
That's such a waste!

135
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,030
Let the bear do its thing!

136
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,770
Oh, I see.

137
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,510
You call that doing its thing?!

138
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,620
Why is the bear training now?!

139
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,580
You could do kind this kind of stuff in a gym!

140
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,320
A fitness instructor could handle that!

141
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,590
You need something different...

142
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,340
Why?!

143
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,370
You're not even doing anything anymore!

144
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,270
And you're back from the mountains!

145
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,790
It's pretty innovative!

146
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,010
It's way too innovative!

147
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,810
You're not even training!

148
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,770
Not doing anything!

149
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,760
So that's why you've been behaving so oddly the past few days, Shin-chan.

150
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,270
You really are the son of a samurai.

151
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,600
S-Sis...

152
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,230
Why didn't you come to me sooner?

153
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,900
I-I'm sorry.

154
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,960
I guess I was embarrassed or I wanted to keep it a secret...

155
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,830
If you rely on that failure of an adult, forget about improving. You'll only get worse.

156
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,850
You say that when I'm sitting right here?

157
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,020
Leave it to me.

158
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,600
I promise I'll help you two become a top-notch samurai.

159
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,800
Now listen carefully, you two.

160
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,440
The desire to become stronger and the desire to become more beautiful

161
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,470
may appear different, but are actually the same.

162
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,100
In other words, you have a desire to change yourself...

163
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,090
Did you know that when you go on a diet,

164
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,050
there's something more important than limiting how much you eat?

165
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,970
That would be to picture what you look like after you've lost weight.

166

You could say that your goal is to reach that ideal.

People are unable to run down a path with no goal,

but once they have a goal, they can continue to run any path no matter how long it is.

If you set a goal that isn't reachable,

you might as well not have a goal.

The man who was a neat freak would always sit down when taking a piss.

So he wouldn't splatter any on the floor.

Meanwhile, the man who was a dirty slob paid no heed.

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,840
He always took care of his business standing, regardless of how much he got on the floor.

255
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,690
A very slight difference.

While the dirty slob's legs became thicker as he aged.

Training should be a part of your daily life.

However, I have a question.

310
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,600
Is the strength you seek merely physical strength?

311
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,390
Is that what you seek from training?

312
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,890
Right.

313
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,970
The true purpose of training

314
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,620
is to push you to your limits

315
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,890
and discover your true self that remains hidden in ordinary times.

316
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,890
Your true self...

317
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,890
Exactly!

318
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,890
Once you've found that, you will not merely attain simple physical strength...

319
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,930
Yes! You will attain true strength!

Once, there was a man who discovered his true self.

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,600
He was a white-collar worker.

322
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,060
He always woke up at the same time, always got on the train at the same time,

323
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,930
always went to the same workplace, and always went home at the same time.

Never late. Never absent.

00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,840
An excellent job performance.

326
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,700
He was the very picture of diligence,

327
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,560
but anyone that looked would find him a dull person.

328
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,570
However, the man never felt bored.

329
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,640
In fact, he had no interest in living his life any other way.

330
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,790
It was a bone-chilling winter morning...

331
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,520
The man attempted to get on the usual train at the usual station at the usual time.

332
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,830
But the difference was the presence of an old man standing in front of him.

333
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,530
Out of consideration for the old man, the man boarded through a different door.

334
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,220
When he reached the next station, the seat in front of the man was open.

335
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,660
This was rush hour.

336
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,700
Under normal circumstances that would be impossible.

337
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,740
Nobody around him moved towards the seat, so the man had no choice but to sit down.

338
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,370
After some more traveling, the train reached the man's stop.

339
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,370
To get off, he needed to leave his seat and make his way through the crowded train to the exit.

340
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,030
That was when the man thought...

341
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,720
"I'd rather get off at the next station and turn back instead of bothering all these people."

342
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,000
And then it was the next station...

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,810
And the next...

344
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,220
By the end, he'd decided to ride until the last stop.

345
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,490
"Yes... What's wrong with being late today?"

346
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,750
And he finally arrived

347
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,510
at the beach.

348
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,210
As the man stood in front of the ocean, he realized

349
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,050
that he was such a tiny existence...

350
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,260
That he'd been living in his own little world...

351
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,490
And so the man quit his job and went on a journey.

352
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:14,380
Yes, that was when he finally realized his true self hidden within and attained true strength.

353
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,270
Why?!

354
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,280
Wow!

355
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,130
No!

356
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,190
You're not supposed to be impressed by that!

357
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,680
And your flashbacks are always too long!

358
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,960
And why would his true self be a bear?!

359
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,860
Why are you making connections with Kagura-chan's picture?!

360
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:37,750
[Note: Mega Drive was called Sega Genesis in the United States.]

361
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,700
Well, I was up all night yesterday playing Altered Beast on Mega Drive.

362
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,430
That's not a reason!

363
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,750
But the bear's really strong.

364
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,850
That's simplifying things too much!

365
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,430
That only covers physical strength, no matter how you look at it!

366
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,680
Then I'll get to the subject at hand.

367
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,300
What training is required to become a true samurai.

368
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,680
[Samurai]

369
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,170
Long ago, Gintoki and I trained in both the pen and the sword at the same school.

370
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:01,240
Yes, if I directly pass on the instruction received from our honorable teacher,

371
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,750
you should be able to become a true samurai like us.

372
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,010
We'll go through your former training...?

373
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,090
Hey, cut it out, Zura.

374
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,890
That training's too dangerous.

375
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,220
It's still too early for them...

376
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,210
They can handle it.

377
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,820
They do not merely seek strength.

378
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,720
Gintoki.

379
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,370
They want to fight by your side.

380
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,750
Do you think a little hardship will be enough to beat them down?

381
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,220
You should know the answer very well.

382
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,350
The training will be harsh, but I'm sure you can endure it.

383
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,350
I like the look in your eyes.

384
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,680
Okay, then start by putting these turtle shells on your back.

385
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,810
They're heavy, but you're not allowed to remove them.

386
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,350
Okay, now you have to go search for a certain item while wearing those weights.

387
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,140
I'm going to throw this rock that has "Katsura" written on it outside.

388
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:11,390
[Katsura]

389
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,650
You must discern this perfectly ordinary stone, besides for the "Katsura" written on it,

390
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,390
from the other stones, and bring it back here.

391
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,170
There's only one stone.

392
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,970
Whoever doesn't bring it back doesn't get dinner tonight.

393
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,440
And just so you know, you won't be able to pick up a random stone and write "Katsura" on it.

394
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,770
I can tell from the handwriting.

395
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,910
Okay, then go!

396
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,460
What is this?!

397
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,660
What is this training?!

398
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,880
We've definitely seen this before!

399
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,060
[Note: Again, a training done in Dxxxxn Baxx. Manga Vol. 3 to be specific.]

400
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,590
What?

401
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,060
Has someone ripped me off?

402
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,880
You're the one who ripped it off!

403
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,240
That's odd.

404
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,980
I remember our teacher doing the same...

405
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,790
What?

406
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,390
[Note: Master Roshi. Character from Dxxxxn Baxx.]

407
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,990
Are you trying to say that you're a student of Master Roshi?!

408
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,390
Hey, Zura.

409
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,510
That's totally wrong.

410
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,460
You're the fool.

411
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,230
Huh?

412
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,550
This wasn't how it went?

413
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,860
It wasn't.

414
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,430
It was a mistake to lend the entire Dragon Boozu series to an idiot like you.

415
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,430
[Note: Dragon Boozu is a Gin Tama parody of Dxxxxn Baxx.]

416
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,990
Right?

417
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,880
Don't surprise me, Gin-san.

418
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,330
I almost thought you became strong through this copycat training.

419
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,850
Hey, give me a break.

420
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,250
It was totally different.

421
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,430
Nothing like this.

422
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,040
First of all, we were carrying fitness instructors, not turtle shells.

423
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,270
Heeyyy!

424
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,840
Cut it out, you freaks!

425
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,200
I told you to drop it already!

426
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,270
And where did these people come from?!

427
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,520
[Gin]

428
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,810
I'm going to throw this instructor that has "Gin" written on it outside.

429
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,840
Why are the instructors the ones being thrown?!

430
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,160
The instructor on the back of the person who doesn't return them doesn't get dinner.

431
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,110
Why?!

432
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,770
The instructor didn't do anything wrong!

433
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,380
And you won't be able to pick up a random instructor and write "Gin" on it.

434
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,180
There aren't random instructors standing around!

435
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,140
I can tell from the handwriting.

436
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,770
You can tell from the instructors' faces!

437
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,470
I can't take this anymore!

438
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,470
We were fools for asking you people!

439
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,970
We won't depend on anyone else!

440
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,760
We'll find our own method of becoming stronger!

441
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,370
Thank you very much!

442
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,740
Just wait and see!

443
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,990
We'll become so strong you'll be shocked!

444
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,570
That's how it should be.

445

You must choose your own path by yourself.

446

They've cleared the first stage of training.

447

I won't go easy on them if they whine.
