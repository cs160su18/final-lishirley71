[The Shinsengumi has 45 articles strictly enforced
by the laws of the "Kyukuchu Hatto."]

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,080
[Hijikata, the man who created those laws, couldn't
possibly...?! And "the man" who returned is...?!]

Did you hear? It seems that guy is returning
to Edo after finishing his job.

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,440
It's Sensei, right? His baggage
arrived already.

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,960
The new weapons he got are inside.

8
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,010
I heard he also picked up some
good quality swords,

9
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,330
so the top members are scrambling.

10
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,630
They're really lucky.
I want a new sword, too.

11
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,410
Ah-hem.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,610
Ah, Yamazaki-san.

13
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,840
Ah! Could that sword be...

14
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,450
...an Osafune Mark II?!

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,450
[Note: Parody of Bizen Osafune, a famous sword.]

16
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,980
That's great! It's got the brand
name on it. So cool!

17
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,940
Well, it's not like I came
here to show it off.

18
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,560
I just happened to pass by. By chance...

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,550
I'm jealous.

20
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,100
Just a little... Please let
me try a practice swing!

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,820
Ah, of course you can.

22
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,560
Wow! I can really feel that
brand-name difference!

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,900
Additionally, it's waterproof. I don't
want to brag, you know...

24
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,030
Hey, what are you guys making
such a fuss about?

25
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,450
Ah, Captain Okita.

26
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,550
Look at Yamazaki-san's sword...

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,570
Huh?

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,900
That sword is a...

29
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,740
[Note: It's rumored the historical Soji Okita
used a sword named Kikuichimonji.]

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,740
Kikuichimonji RX-78!

31
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:52,000
It has a built-in digital music player with
a maximum playing time of 124 hours!

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,950
It's the Kikuichimonji RX-78!

33
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,120
It costs twice as much as the Osafune!

34
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,660
The swords at the captain's
level are really something!

35
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,540
Hmm... Is this sword that great?

36
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,130
I just picked it up without thinking,
so I didn't realize that.

37
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,580
Huh?

38
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,730
What's that stick? Yamazaki... What
is that? Did you buy that?

39
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,170
It almost looks rusted.

40
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,150
Captain, please let me try a
few practice swings for a bit!

41
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,150
Wow! This first-class stuff
is really amazing!

42
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,250
It sounds completely different!
The deep bass is amazing!

43
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,960
Hey, what's going on? Why
is it so noisy this morning?

44
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,080
Chief! I'm sorry. Well...

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,510
That sword is...

46
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,850
The Kotetsu Z-Second.

47
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,850
[Note: Kotetsu Nagasone was a famous swordsmith. The historical Isami Kondo was said to own a fake Kotetsu sword.]

48
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,080
Not only does it have digital
music equipment,

49
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,160
but it also has a special metal attachment on
the end that can be used as a floor cleaner!

50
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,060
It costs three times as much
as the Kikuichimonji! Cool!

51
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,590
You guys are using such cheap swords?
A sword is a samurai's soul.

52
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,490
If you use such shabby swords, it'll
reveal the true nature of your soul.

53
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,290
Kondo-san, you're great! We
won't ever be equal to you.

54
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,800
We should work harder and hope to some
day own stuff on your kind of level.

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,010
Kondo-san, can I try some practice
swings for a moment?

56
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,890
Ah, go right ahead.

57
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,260
There!

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,150
Kotetsu!

59
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,730
Ah, I'm sorry. I thought a sword like this
could cut through rock, but it failed.

60
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,730
You! You definitely did that on purpose!

61
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,730
You were jealous of my Kotetsu-chan...
You were jealous!

["Rules Are Made to be Broken"]

63
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,250
I'm not going to say a sword
is a samurai's soul.

64
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,980
Besides, I don't think the level of the
sword one carries raises his status.

65
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,990
For me, a sword is just a sword.

66
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,360
And that's the most important
thing to me.

67
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,240
Most important of all is a sword that can
break through the enemy's blade.

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,700
It seems you're overdoing
it as rashly as ever.

69
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,600
A sword can be used again
after it's been mended,

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,210
but humans don't work that way.

71
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,950
As long as a human doesn't
break, he can recover, right?

72
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,030
If you keep fighting in such a way that
damages your sword so much,

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,750
you'll end up being broken in two
pretty soon. That's what I meant.

74
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,620
This looks like a good sword.

75
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,390
Old man, until mine is repaired,
let me borrow this.

76
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,640
You can't use that one.

77
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,780
That sword comes with a story behind it.

78
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,180
What? You mean I can listen to music with
it or it can be used as a floor cleaner?

79
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,040
There's no question that sword
is terribly sharp. However...

80
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,140
It's cursed.

81
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,570
Cursed? You've got to be kidding me.

82
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,880
An ordinary sword user will be consumed
by the soul of that sword.

83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,730
You won't able to handle it.

84
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,030
...Will you listen to my old
story for a moment?

85
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,130
It's a tragic tale of a reincarnated
demonic sword...

86
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,800
But I didn't listen to it.

87
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,170
In general, old men's stories tend to
be long. I don't have time for that.

88
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,540
Whether its price is high or low, whether
it can be used to listen to music,

89
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,550
or whether the sword is cursed,
it doesn't matter to me.

90
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,420
You must be Shinsengumi Vice-Chief
Toshiro Hijikata-dono.

91
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,300
Although you're a samurai, you've
sided with the Amanto for perks!

92
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,500
You're a traitor! We, the advanced
party of the Anti-Foreigner Faction,

93
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,030
are here to bring punishment
from heaven!

94
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,650
This is a chance to test it out.

95
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,960
Let me see how this cursed
demonic sword works.

96
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,000
Here we go!

97
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm sorry!

98
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,510
Huh? What's this...?

99
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,520
Wh-What am I doing? My body
is moving on its own...

100
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,350
My mouth is moving on its own...

101
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,080
I'm sorry! My life! Please spare me!

102
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,530
I'll lick anything, even the
soles of your sandals!

103
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,260
Who's this pathetic guy?!

104
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,030
That's Toshiro Hijikata!

105
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,790
The man who is feared as the Demon
Vice-Chief! How miserable!

106
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,560
Wh-Wh-What's wrong with me?!
My body doesn't respond at all!

107
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,750
An ordinary sword user will be consumed
by the soul of that sword.

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,580
Don't tell me... This...?!

109
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,080
Why is the demonic sword's curse making
me act this way?! That's ridiculous...!

110
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,950
I don't know what's going on,

111
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,560
but we'll be paying you back for
everything you did to us before!

112
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,410
You just said you would lick the soles
of our sandals, didn't you?!

113
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,220
Then lick it!

114
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,070
Y-You bastard!

115
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:50,180
It may be a cursed sword or whatever,
but... I... Ugh... won't...!

116
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,970
Um... Please forgive
me by accepting this.

117
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,250
I have 3,000 yen.

118
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,320
But please don't take my Suica, because
I won't be able to go home without it.

119
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,320
[Note: Suica is a rechargeable IC card used
as a fare card on train lines in Japan.]

120
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,280
Don't screw with us!

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,730
What's with this guy?!
He's flip-flopping his personality!

122
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,480
Anyway, why does an adult like
you have only 3,000 yen?!

123
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,130
This is bad... There's something
totally wrong with me...

124
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,990
I'm a goner...

125
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,210
As things are...

126
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,460
I'll be finished...

127
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,710
Hey!

128
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,570
A familiar uniform.

129
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,300
A familiar stance.

130
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,560
But his face is...

131
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,930
I just saw a member of the Shinsengumi
being attacked, so I rushed over here...

132
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,170
What are you doing in a place like this,

133
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,290
Hijikata-kun?

134
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,130
You're...

135
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,100
A toast to Kamotaro Ito-kun's
return. Cheers!

136
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,110
Cheers!

137
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,630
Well, Ito Sensei, you did
a good job this time.

138
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,300
But that many weapons...

139
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,230
I wonder how you got those stingy people in
the government to loosen their purse strings!

140
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,420
Kondo-san, being stingy means being shrewd
enough to profit from a different viewpoint.

141
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,600
All you have to do is just explain that the government
will profit by making expenditures on us...

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,290
Though, just as you say, Kondo-san,

143
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,580
they're pertinacious people who don't care
about our hardships and groveling.

144
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,740
It wasn't easy for me to explain it to them,
in a way they could easily understand.

145
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,760
That's right! That's absolutely right!

146
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,420
They're pertinacious! They really are!

147
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,470
Kondo-san, what does
pertinacious mean?

148
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,900
You shut up! Kids should be quiet!

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,930
Kondo-san, if people like them stay at
the top, this country will be ruined.

150
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,010
We can't stay in a smoldering
place like this.

151
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:02,330
We have to move forward! We must
work toward a higher goal!

152
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,460
And we'll eventually become like the swords,
the keystones of this country.

153
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,570
I believe that saving this confused country is
the mission for those of us born as samurai.

154
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,400
For that, I wouldn't mind
giving my life to you!

155
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,460
Kondo-san, let's work hard together!

156
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,730
Right. Everyone, let's work
hard pertinacious!

157
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,100
No, you're using "pertinacious"
the wrong way.

158
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,610
Ito-san has started expressing
his valuable opinions again.

159
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,640
Even the Chief calls him "Sensei."

160
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,110
He's just a newcomer who
joined us only a year ago.

161
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,330
I wonder if he's getting so full of himself

162
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,920
because he was just assigned the title of advisor.

163
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm not blaming him.

164
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,510
He's intelligent, really good at his job and
is fully proficient in Hokuto Itto Ryu.

165
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,510
[Note: The Hokuto Itto Ryu is a northern sword style.]

166
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,360
Vice-Chief is also intelligent, but he's
really only a battle strategist.

167
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,970
So Ito-san's the only person who
can manage political matters.

168
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,600
No wonder he is a great help to the chief.

169
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,070
Ito-san has hardly ever been in the headquarters...
but it might be about time...

170
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,450
For what?

171
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,120
I've never seen Ito-san and Hijikata-san talk
about each other, only about their jobs.

172
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,400
Hijikata-kun, I have something
to ask you.

173
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,560
What a coincidence... me, too.

174
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,090
You hate me,
don't you?

175
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,930
Because I'm Kondo-san's favorite,
and although I'm a newcomer,

176
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,110
I'm rising to fame so fast
that it threatens you.

177
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,620
I bet I'm an eyesore to you, right?

178
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,150
That's what you think? You want to advance
in your career, but I'm higher than you.

179
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,890
I bet I'm an eyesore to you, right?

180
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,930
It's a groundless suspicion, Hijikata-kun.
I don't think about that kind of thing.

181
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,870
That's good. It seems we have cleared
up any misunderstandings.

182
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,000
An eyesore...

183
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,500
It's even more than that.

184
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,560
Some time in the future, I'll kill you.

185
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,110
Toshi...

186
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,480
I heard about you from Ito Sensei.

187
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,090
That was a stroke of bad
luck. How's your injury?

188
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,040
Toshi...

189
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,650
Although we call ourselves samurai,

190
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,960
we're really just a bunch of country boys.

191
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:41,440
[Kyukuchu Hatto]

192
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,110
Even though that's what we
are, when facing death,

193
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,090
we're able to act more like
samurai than real samurai.

194
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,650
It was because of the Kyokuchu Hatto,

195
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,890
the strict laws you created,
that we can be like that.

196
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,760
It has 45 articles, encompassing everything
from daily behavior to manners,

197
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,590
and even battle preparation.

198
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,690
These are the strict laws that govern us.

199
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,100
If you break any one of those laws,
you'll have to commit seppuku.

200
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,280
That's your image of the ideal samurai.

201
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,000
We all agree.

202
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,680
Do you understand, Toshi?

203
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,740
You're the ideal samurai
model for everyone.

204
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,960
Everyone models himself after
you. Everyone watches you.

205
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm not in a position to say this, but don't do
anything to betray the way of the samurai.

206
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,820
...He's quite a guy.

207
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,970
As quick as a flash, news of my
shameful behavior has spread.

208
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:26,120
Well, for him, it's the perfect opportunity
to defeat me and rise up the ladder.

209
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,710
Toshi, stop talking that way. Ito Sensei is
thinking about the spirit of the group...

210
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,740
I already told you to stop
calling him "Sensei."

211
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,340
Kondo-san, are you going to give
your position of Chief to him?

212
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,160
If that's not the case,

213
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,120
are you going to share your position as
head of the Shinsengumi with him?

214
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,770
Need I remind you that members are
unsure about how to treat him.

215
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,580
His former colleagues, who entered at
the same time, are already his allies.

216
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,230
Are you saying that Ito Sensei is trying
to take over the Shinsengumi?

217
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,040
Who knows?

218
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,530
But ever since he got here he's done nothing
but gather allies and influence.

219
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,600
...It's obvious he's up to something.

220
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,530
He's not as powerful as he wants
to be and he's not satisfied.

221
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,130
Kondo-san... If a snake has two heads...

222
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:24,000
...one either has to rot and fall off or the
ensuing feud will split the body in two.

223
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,210
I believe that Ito Sensei is a crucial
man for the Shinsengumi.

224
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,000
Hey, Toshi, we're not doing this
to ensure your own position.

225
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,700
We're doing this to protect Edo and
to stick to the ways of the samurai.

226
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,190
To get that wisdom, I'll ask for
anyone who can teach it.

227
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,360
It's natural to call the person
who teaches us "Sensei."

228
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,100
If you ask me to treat him
like a follower, I'll refuse.

229
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,650
I've never thought of you
guys as my followers.

230
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,130
As for the way of the samurai,
we're on equal footing.

231
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,120
Kondo-san, you don't
understand anything.

232

Pretty words won't help manage
the organization...!

to record it! Tomoe-chan!

Punishment is complete.

240
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,570
Hey, hey, did you hear
about the Vice-Chief?

241
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,390
Hear what?

242
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,020
The Vice-Chief was attacked by Anti-Foreigner
Faction ronin the other day.

243
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,660
He was saved by Ito-san. But
you probably won't believe it.

244
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,600
The Vice-Chief knelt, bowed
and begged for his life.

245
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,800
It's impossible that something
like that could happen.

246
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,770
He would rather die than
do something like that.

247
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,670
He's the demon Vice-Chief.
The "demon."

248
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,360
But I heard it, too.

Hey, hey, cut it out already.

If this conversation is overheard,
we'll be in trouble.

rules to pass JUMP around.

Just take a peek. You'll see hell on earth.

301
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,330
What? Is there anyone you like?

302
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,480
Not really. I don't have anyone.

303
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,290
Come on! I already told you,
so it’s your turn to tell me.

304
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,890
It's not fair! Not fair! You lied to me,
didn't you?! You did! You tell me!

305
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,730
All right! I'll tell you then! But don't
tell anyone! It's a secret.

306
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,910
Well, I don't know about that.

307
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,200
Oh, damn it! The teachers are on
patrol. Put out the cigarettes!

308
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,160
Is this a school trip or something?

309
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,460
…That's how it goes.

310
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,090
After I got this sword,
everything went wrong.

311
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,950
It looks like I’m really cursed.

312
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,240
That’s why I didn't want to tell you.

313
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,580
You don't believe me, do you?
There's no way you'll believe me.

314
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,170
Just like that, I had switched personalities
with someone completely different.

315
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,790
No, that wasn't someone else.

316
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,260
The weak side inside everyone
gets awakened by this sword.

317
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,200
Hijikata-san, you can't blame
being weak on the sword.

318
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,520
You were weak to begin
with, Hijikata-san.

319
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,580
That's right; I'm always like this…

320
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,560
Oh, my…this is really something strange.

321
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,210
Then why don't you just throw
away that cursed sword?

322
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:01,570
I would, If I could. I even find myself carrying
it with me to the toilet and bath.

323
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,800
I can't get rid of it, even if I want to.

324
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,220
And the old man at the swordsmith’s
isn't there anymore.

325
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,220
Then are you trying to say…that's the reason
you had a fight with Kondo-san?

326
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,950
…I wish I could say that…

327
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,610
Hijikata-san, if you don’t
pay attention this time,

328
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,050
Ito-san will take away your
vice-chief position.

329
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,230
No time for that now.

330
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,850
Since I became like this, I've already broken
more than ten of the Kyokuchu Hatto rules.

331
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,820
If Ito delivers a sentence for seppuku
tomorrow, I wouldn't be surprised.

332
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,770
As I am right now, I wouldn't refuse.

333
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,170
If you're with me, you'll
attract Ito's attention.

334
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,550
…Hijikata-san…

335
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,660
Wait, Hijikata-san!

336
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,110
[Note: Yakisoba pan is noodles in a hot dog bun.]

337
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,110
Go buy me a Yakisoba pan.

338
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,110
And JUMP, too. Of course,
you pay for them.

339
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,400
Toshi is late. It's already past the time.

340
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,050
This is a really important meeting…

341
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,650
Kondo-san.

342
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,060
This is a good opportunity. I was going
to bring him up for discussion.

343
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,680
I think you’ve already heard
about his recent behavior.

344
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,400
He broke the Kyokuchu Hatto
rules more than ten times.

345
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,090
And yet he created those
rules for the members.

346
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,210
Besides him being late for an
important meeting like this,

347
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,380
If we continue to let him act like this, we won't
be able to control the other members.

348
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,630
Sensei, hold on. I know Toshi well.

349
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,290
He must have something
exceedingly important…

350
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,220
I'm not only talking about
this particular case.

351
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:43,250
Of course, I fully understand what he
achieved for the Shinsengumi before.

352
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,180
That's why I want to give
him some candid advice.

353
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,300
If he's the symbol of the Shinsengumi,
and he downplays the rules,

354
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,590
other members will do the same.

355
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,630
A pack of wolves that has lost its discipline
will be like sheep without a shepherd.

356
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,040
He's the one who deserves
strict punishment!

357
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,200
Kondo-san, please make a firm decision!

358
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,220
Hold on! Toshi will definitely…

359
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,560
Hi! I bought your Yakisoba
pan, Okita Senpai!

360
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,090
I'm sorry, but they didn't have
JUMP, so I got MAGAZINE…

361
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,910
D-Damn it! I was trapped!

362
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,610
Those guys…were working together!

363
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,080

365
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,490
I didn't expect anything
like that, Okita-kun.

366
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,630
That you would be on my
side. What do you desire?

367
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,350
Naturally…the Vice-Chief position.
