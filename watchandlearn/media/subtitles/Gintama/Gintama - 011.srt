[Strawberry milk is Gin's favorite. Get lots of calcium and your bones will be strong]

3
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,080
[The client is an old man on his last legs.  He's literally "dead or alive."]

4
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,080
["Look, Overly Sticky Sweet Dumplings Are Not Real Dumplings, You Idiot!"]

5
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,630
What? So what if it's a little different?!

6
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,490
Don't you know the saying "Everyone's different, and everyone's great?"

7
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,860
It's not Number One, it's the Only One!

8
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,000
Quit complaining!

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,510
You're badly mistaken if you think you can get by in this world by blaming everyone else.

10
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,640
The world is full of demons!

11
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,770
Now listen up! This is what's important!

12
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,150
[Calcium]

13
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,870
Yes, calcium!

14
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,850
As long as you get plenty of calcium, everything will turn out fine.

15
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,180
Cramming for exams? Fights with your parents?

16
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,620
That girl you like? A smelly crotch?

17
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,450
Get your calcium and it'll all work out

18
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,690
No, it won't!

19
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,200
No matter how much calcium you drink, if you get hit by a car, your leg's still gonna break!

20
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,680
I got hit too, but I'm fine!

21
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,230
It's all because I drink this every day.

22
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,030
Don't act so high and mighty. You just like the taste of strawberry milk!

23
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,600
What?! I drink coffee milk too, you know!

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,580
800 calories every day, go easy on the salt,

25
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,080
pretty tasty for 300 yen per meal.

26
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,480
That's my hospital meal!

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,670
Just drink strawberry milk, strawberry milk.

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,690
Your breath! Sickly sweet!

29
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,440
What? Gin exhales his "sweet breath".

30
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,460
Argh! Shinpachi sustains 99 points of damage!

31
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,690
Keep the noise down!

32
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,140
You're bothering the other patients!

33
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,970
There's even one who's on the verge of death. Do you get me, you little creep?!

34
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,280
Oh, sorry. He's so noisy.

35
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,600
You're a really awful person!

36
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,660
It is time for Professor Jaijien to make his rounds.

37
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,740
Look, I'm a grown man, so just leave me alone.

38
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,520
You're making it hard for me to stay in the hospital.

39
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,930
No matter how old we get, we are all on a journey in search of our place in life.

40
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,200
Quit paraphrasing life like it's a folk song!

41
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,780
Father-yo! Mother-yo! Hey-hey-ho!

42
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,070
Looking-for-my-home, in-a-manhole.

43
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,860
A long journey, a tiring one.

44
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,470
And forget the rap music! Besides, what kind of lyrics are those?!

45
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,560
Man, too many artist wannabes.

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,360
I chalk it up to calcium deficiency.

47
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,470
Strawberry milk, huh?

48
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,420
I drank a lot of it when I was young.

49
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,220
With the gals in tow.

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,130
How dare you?!

51
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,170
Satsuki, now she was a good girl.

52
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,130
"So much strawberry milk isn't good for you.

53
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,310
Drink coffee milk once in a while," is what she'd say.

54
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,770
And Yukari... She was totally in-your-face. But she worried about me, too.

55
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,050
It's been a long time since I've seen a "Strawberry Milky" like you!

56
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,450
Strawberry Milky?

57
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,650
Right.

58
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,060
A man who puts his honor on the line

59
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,770
and keeps drinking strawberry milk is known to all as Strawberry Milky!

60
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,330
Nah, I'm just the Odd Jobs guy in this poor little town.

61
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,060
Odd Jobs?

62
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,930
And we'd better get going. We've got work to do.

63
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,800
Odd Jobs?

64
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,370
Man, we're so busy. After all, I do take odd jobs.

65
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,310
Odd Jobs!

66
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,580
This is bad! It's like the emergency bell went off inside him.

67
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,770
Hamada didn't flinch when he was called "Crater-face,"

68
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,580
but that autumn during our second year in middle school,

69
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,570
he went crazy and threw chairs around when someone called him "Pock."

70
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,030
Who's Hamada?

71
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,420
You just said Odd Jobs, didn't you?

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,440
That means you'll do any kind of odd job for anyone?

73
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,690
I can't bring you back from the edge of the grave!

74
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,870
For that, please make a donation of gold at the church.

75
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,080
Sometimes, they'll do it for free. But Great-grandma told me not to say...

76
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,150
No, sorry. By gold, I'm talking about a game and...

77
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,010
Oh man, talking about a game in my final moments... Aghhh!

78
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,830
Once again, Professor Jaijien will make his rounds.

79
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,380
I want you to find the owner of this hair ornament.

80
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,720
Why is that?

81
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,780
She was my first l-o-v-e.

82
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,890
Hey, what's with the pickled seaweed?

83
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,310
Whenever I hear a sad story, eating pickled seaweed calms my heart.

84
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,530
I've spent all my days chasing tail the whole time.

85
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,730
But for some reason, all I can remember now is her smile.

86
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,740
Gimme some pickled seaweed, too.

87
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,540
Both of you? Pathetic!

88
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,560
Laugh if you want.

89
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,830
An old man like me would yearn for love on his deathbed.

90
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,590
I'm not laughing...

91
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,010
She was so beautiful...

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,610
She always wore the kanzashi and worked hard every day.

93
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,660
She was the talk of the town.

94
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,530
Ayano!

95
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,210
Every man was in love with her.

96
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,890
And they all went to the shop where she worked and got fat eating dumplings.

97
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,810
I wanted to join them, but I had no money and besides, I was way too shy.

98
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,870
All I could do was lurk behind corners to catch a glimpse of her.

99
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,500
Then one day...

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,660
I see you've come to visit again.

101
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,300
Don't be shy! Come over here.

102
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,410
You're always watching from over there.

103
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,810
I see you every time.

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,480
Those were the first words Ayano uttered to me.

105
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,540
But right after that...

106
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,050
You must really like it.

107
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,510
Here you go.

108
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,060
You wanted these, didn't you?

109
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,740
But don't tell anyone, okay?

110
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,920
She had no idea how I felt about her.

111
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,290
Which was probably a stroke of luck.

112
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,460
After all, just being near her made me almost pass out.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,430
Of course, I couldn't even swallow the dumplings.

114
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,190
Are you all right?!

115
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,090
What's wrong?!

116
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,070
As I lay there choking on the dumpling, I didn't think about dying.

117
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,600
My only thoughts were of regret that I wouldn't see her again.

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,170
Somebody, help!

119
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,390
I pulled myself together and run away.

120
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,220
When I regained my senses...

121
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,060
I was lying in some alley, covered in my own vomit.

122
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,070
I had been half out of my mind when I ran,

123
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,260
and somehow I had grabbed her hair ornament on the way.

124
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,280
I want you to find her.

125
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,490
It's gonna cost you. We're a top-class operation, after all.

126
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,930
I have money.

127
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,100
I've spent all I want on women, and still I can't use it up.

128
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,550
I have no family, so I've often wondered what to do about my wealth.

129
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,560
If you accept my request, I'll leave you my entire fortune.

130
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,960
Ah well, I guess we don't have much choice!

131
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,410
We can't turn down an old man's request.

132
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,030
You look like you're trying hard not to look so happy!

133
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,970
Shut up, Shinpachi!

134
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,010
You're gonna take good care of our client!

135
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
You put your heart and soul into this!

136
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,440
Excuse me? I'm still a patient here.

137
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,010
You fool!

138
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,820
Odd Jobs exists to help people, right?!

139
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,950
It isn't money or education, but love. That's what's important in life!

140
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,290
And when a youth forgets vitality and kindness, then he's nothing.

141
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,070
Huh? Why am I the hapless youth in this?

142
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,620
Is "fortune" better than pickled seaweed?

143
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,480
It's even better than a family pack of pickled seaweed.

144
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,610
Wow!

145
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,070
Hey!

146
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,260
Kanzashi Dango Shop?

147
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,970
Never heard of the place.

148
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,460
I heard it used to be in this district, a long time ago.

149
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,240
Nope, I can't remember anything beyond three days ago.

150
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,020
You're worse than a chicken.

151
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,630
Since you're here... How about paying your bill, Gintoki?

152
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,780
The last time you paid was 219 days ago.

153
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,030
After that, you had isobe dumplings 207 days ago

154
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,200
and amazake and kinako dumplings 202 days ago...

155
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,670
And what?

156
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,330
Are you like those kids who can memorize every stop on the Tokaido line from Tokyo?

157
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,460
The day isn't long enough.

158
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,100
Anyway, we're looking for a girl named Ayano who used to work at this shop named Kanzashi.

159
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,250
Well, it's over 50 years ago, so she's probably a granny now.

160
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,730
Nope, no good. I'm not interested in chicks over forty years old.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,540
Never mind that, Gintoki. Pay your tab, will you?

162
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,010
The last time you paid was 219 days ago.

163
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,970
You'd be more popular with chicks if you learn the formula for pi.

164
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,030
Huh? For real?!

165
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,500
Wait! Which is better?! Being able to name the chief secretaries of Russia or the shoguns?!

166
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,610
I bought it. Your JUMP and Weekly Playboy.

167
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,360
Also, I couldn't reach Kayoko and Rira because their phone numbers have been changed.

168
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,310
I see.

169
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,810
Then call Mai and Ayumi.

170
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,440
Then I want you to buy me some fruit-flavored milk and a fried shrimp sandwich.

171
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,120
You've got to have fruit-flavored milk with a fried shrimp sandwich.

172
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,560
Don't you know even that?

173
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,020
No, I don't!

174
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,690
Why do all the people around me have their own rules?!

175
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,660
Anyway...

176
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,560
I see three options.

177
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,420
1. Read your palm.

178
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,430
2. Hold hands.

179
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,470
3. Paper.

180
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,810
Which is it?

181
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,310
Money! Pay up! Do you know how much I've spent on you so far?!

182
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,620
My goodness, you youngsters always thinking about money!

183
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,590
How sad. Are you some money-cursing ghost?!

184
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,100
I can't keep up with this! Who does he think he is, that old geezer?!

185
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,910
And that's just unbelievable.

186
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,130
The photos in Playboy go from large to small.

187
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,740
Why doesn't he look at them in order?! I can't believe he skipped pages!

188
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,700
Oh, I can't stand that old pervert.

189
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,240
Just shake that head of his.

190
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,020
They may call us angels in white, but it's enough to make me wanna kill.

191
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,530
It'd be a different story if we got tips for this.

192
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,920
Not gonna happen.

193
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,790
Even his hospital bills have piled up for months. He's famous for being broke.

194
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,680
Why that old pervert.

195
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,590
Why that dirty, old bastard!

196
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,180
Money!

197
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,020
Oh, you found out?

198
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,250
How dare you?!

199
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

200
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,690
Are you trying to ruin an old man's dream all because of a little thing like money?

201
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,310
How dare you say such a thing!

202
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,760
When the money runs dry, so does our relationship. It's over.

203
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,320
I'm taking the JUMP. I wanna know what happens in the tenth issue.

204
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,660
This hospital food, too. I'm sorta curious about the lightly sweetened desserts.

205
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,270
So that's it. No hard feelings eh?

206
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,320
So now you know, I'm not just some old pervert...

207
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,200
...I'm a very sick old pervert.

208
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,480
Reika says my hollow cheeks are irresistible.

209
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,300
Who was it that said something about being oppressed with sorrow?

210
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,640
Oh yes, that was Kana.

211
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,200
Your pallor... Are you really?

212
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,010
There's more to the dumpling story. Will you listen?

213
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,620
Later, I heard that she got fired from the shop.

214
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,790
It wasn't just me.

215
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,970
She secretly gave dumplings to poor kids, hungry stray dogs and cats,

216
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,140
as she came across them.

217
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,770
Her boss found out that she'd given me free dumplings.

218
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,850
So I was the reason she was fired.

219
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:01,450
I did a terrible thing. Now it's too late to apologize.

220
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,570
I wanted to at least return her hair ornament before I died.

221
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,170
Actually, I'd just like to see her smiling face one more time.

222
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,760
Let's go.

223
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,770
We're leaving?

224
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,950
We're going to find the owner of the hair ornament.

225
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,500
Huh?

226
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,130
Listen.

227
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,020
Let's say you drink too much strawberry milk during the day

228
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,570
and wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.

229
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,680
But it's cold outside. You don't want to leave the comfort of your futon.

230
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,240
But the urge to pee gets stronger and stronger!

231
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,400
Anguish! Worry! Trouble!

232
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,350
You make up your mind and go to the toilet!

233
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,040
You stand in front of the john! You let loose!

234
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,560
Man, that feeling of release!

235
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,510
All that pent-up feeling being released!

236
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,830
But then you realize... you're not in front of the john, you're still under the covers!

237
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,760
That warm feeling spreads between your thighs. But it won't stop. You can't stop!

238
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,770
That's what it's all about.

239
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,000
That's the true nature of Strawberry Milky! Understand?!

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,500
Strawberry Milky!

241
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,990
That's it...

242
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,010
Strawberry Milky!

243
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,740
Strawberry Milky! Strawberry Milky!

244
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,910
Strawberry Milky!

245
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,450
Strawberry Milky! Strawberry Milky!

246
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,680
Strawberry Milky! Strawberry Milky!

247
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,030
But how are we gonna track down the owner of a common hair ornament?

248
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,420
I have an idea.

249
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,110
Sadaharu, if you find her, you can chew this up all you like.

250
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,800
Hey, that's ridiculous!

251
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,650
What do you mean "chew this up all you like"?! Who is "this"?

252
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,530
Smile.

253
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,920
What kind of smile is that?!

254
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,140
It's been fifty years! There's no scent left on it.

255
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,280
Who knows? Maybe Ayano had strong B.O.?

256
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,450
What?! Body odor?

257
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,360
Don't shatter my youthful dreams of a woman, pickled seaweed girl!

258
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,020
Don't worry, Shinpachi. Pretty girls always smell good, no exception.

259
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,850
Although, there are some who are pretty but have strong body odor.

260
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,880
Is that a fetish?

261
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,310
No, no, no... Rather than the perfect woman, it makes you remember her, you know?

262
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,110
Huh?! Hey! You led us back home!

263
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,900
Did you think you were just out for a walk, moron?!

264
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,790
What is it? You're supposed to pee outside! Life is all about hit-and-run!

265
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,480
Hey, you don't think?

266
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,160
No way...

267
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,160
Whatcha want?

268
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,400
Came to pay the rent?

269
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:41,210
Listen, I'm a creature of the night, so I don't work during the day.

270
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,910
Come back when it's dark, idiot!

271
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,150
No, there's no way she's...

272
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,720
Nope, not way.

273
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,090
She doesn't look like an Ayano.

274
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,910
Nope, no way.

275
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,340
How do you know my real name?

276
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,600
Wha?!

277
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,490
My head is gonna explode! I can't understand her words?!

278
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,270
Don't mess with me, granny!

279
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,150
No way are you Ayano!

280
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,920
If that's your name, then "battleship" would come before it!

281
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Heey!! You callin' me a battle axe?!

282
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,450
Otose is an alias. My professional name.

283
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,610
My real name is Ayano Terada.

284
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,050
Little ants, out for a nice walk?

285
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,790
You can't cover up the truth with inane babble! I am Ayano, not an ant!

286
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,760
Yes? Otose Snack Shop.

287
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,750
What? Odd Jobs?

288
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,290
It's a call for you from Oedo Hospital.

289
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,560
Something about an old man in critical condition.

290
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,290
Someone you know in the hospital?

291
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,660
His condition is critical. He's nearing his end.

292
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,300
He had an untreatable heart condition.

293
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,970
Well... I understand he was quite the lady's man,

294
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,430
but not a single one of them has come to his bedside. How sad.

295
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,480
In any case, as far as the hospital is concerned, we'll have one less problematic patient.

296
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,600
Dr. Jaijien, his pulse is weakening.

297
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,480
Look out! It's a runaway horse!

298
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,270
Help!

299
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,010
Watch out!

300
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,660
Damn it!

301
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,170
Hey, we stepped on something just now!

302
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,870
Forget it.

303
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,940
In the pursuit of our mission, a few small sacrifices are nothing!

304
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,250
That was a person! Maybe a person. It was a person!

305
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,150
Nah.

306
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,850
I think it was a pebble or a cottonball.

307
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,270
You guys are awful.

308
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,780
It's time.

309
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,520
No one came to his deathbed, after all.

310
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Old man!

311
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,060
Wh-Who are you people?!

312
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,510
Strawberry Milky has a promise to keep to a comrade.

313
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,300
I brought her to you.

314
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,150
D-Dr. Jaijien! He's conscious!

315
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,110
What?!

316
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,660
Hey, are you listening?

317
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,980

I returned the kanzashi. Can you see, old man?

Yes, I can see.

Hey, granny?

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,070
Did you actually remember him?

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,830
Remember what?

I wonder...

332
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,780
And now...
