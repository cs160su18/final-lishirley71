6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,160
We're delighted to welcome you to host club Takamagahara.

7
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,000
I am one of the club's top three, Shin.

8
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,140
I am Gin. Just do it.

9
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,040
Gura. Fuu!

10
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,010
What?

11
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,720
You've got guts. Come here.

12
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,810
Though, I'd rather be served by some pretty ladies.

13
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,550
Excuse...

14
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,680
...me.

15
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,020
Huh? Gin-sa--

16
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,140
Ma'am? Oh my, drunk already, fuu?

17
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,540
No, the old lady hasn't drunk anything yet.

18
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,900
Hey Shin, take the old...

19
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,820
...er, madam, over there and let her rest. Just do it.

20
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay. Even if it costs me my life.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,890
How troublesome. But never mind.

22
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,810
Kyoshiro-han, let's get back...

23
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,490
to what we were talking about.

24
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,780
Something to drink?

25
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,880
Shochu and water, 7 and 3. Now, getting back to...

26
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,280
Is that shochu 3 or water 3?

27
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,150
[Shochu and water 7:3]
[Note: the entire gag is about the homonym "san" which can mean the number 3 or a name title.]

28
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:59,560
[Shochu 3]

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,050
Shochu. Now getting back to...

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,150
[Water 3]

31
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,030
Shochu 3?

32
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,140
That's shochu 3. Now getting back to...

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,810
Shochu-san, what will you have?

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,530
[Shochu-san]

35
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,530
My name is not Shochu-san!

36
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, I want shochu san but that san isn't "-san"

37
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,160
but "three" as in three parts shochu, seven parts water. Okay?

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,670
Okay. Even if it costs me my life.

39
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,310
That'll never become popular.

40
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,670
Though you've been pushing it! It's irritating, so stop it!

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,390
Getting back to our discussion. This is getting tedious, so I'll be frank.

42
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,840
If you don't want...to see your friends hurt, accept our demands.

43
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,240
It's not a bad offer, don't you think? It's very simple.

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,900
You charm stupid women with your sweet talk

45
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,210
and our tough guys drive away the stupid men.

46
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,910
We'll split the profits exactly 70-30.

47
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,490
Everybody's happy.

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,130
I told you before.

49
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,360
Neither I, nor Hachiro have any intention of using the services of people like you.

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,880
We survive in this town on our own strength, and we've come this far.

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,320
We have no intention of changing that.

52
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,230
Oh... Then you don't care what happens to your...

53
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,530
Hey, come on. That hurts! And that's annoying me!

54
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,430
If you don't have a lighter, use this.

55
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,890
My, that's nice. Is it a present?

56
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,710
It's heavy. It's like we're a couple. I can't accept it.

57
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,650
I didn't give it to you. Use it to give me a light!

58
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,780
Don't use it with a flint stone!

59
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,160
Oh, what've you done? This was expensive, you know.

60
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,110
Kyoshiro-san! Don't worry about me! Don't do what they want!

61
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,230
We've lived through Hell and even changed our faces!

62
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,570
Hachiro...

63
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,600
Quiet.

64
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,040
But no matter what, we decided to walk on our own, to live in this town...

65
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,540
our own way!

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,230
You've got some nerve.

67
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,650
All right, then I'll show you just how scary it is to live in this town.

68
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,080
Stop it!

69
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,590
It's too late now. I have to draw the line.

70
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,500
I'll show you just how more serious...I am than you!

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,380
Stop it!

72
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,370
Say, did you know?

73
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,370
When a samurai draws the line, he slits his belly.

74
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,340
I'm not ready to do that, so I wouldn't really know, though.

75
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,680
Wh-Who are you?

76
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,580
What the hell are you doing?!

77
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,580
I have an order for three Dom Perignino!

78
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,280
Okay. Even if it costs me my life.

79
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,300
Ah, just do it!

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,480
Things don't go that easily in this world.

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
A text message, eh?

82
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,180
It's Meru-chan. Meru-chan became a mom while I was away!

83
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,680
She gave birth? Congratulations.

84
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,950
Congratulations, nothing, moron!

85
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,650
I can't stay here. We're leaving right now!

86
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,630
R-Right!

87
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,210
Remember this, people!

88
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,000
We won't be this easy on you the next time we meet!

89
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,360
Thank you very much.

90
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,280
You put us through a lot of trouble.

91
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,940
But I can't let a son get killed right in front of his mother's eyes.

92
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,190
Son?

93
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,670
Don't play dumb.

94
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,080
Gin-chan, we have a problem!

95
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,810
The old lady... The old lady is nowhere to be found!

96
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,180
What? How about in the bathroom?

97
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,410
No.

98
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,350
Maybe those guys grabbed her.

99
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,370
Mom!

100
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,160
Mom?

101
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,660
I see. So that guy was the Odd Jobs above Otose's shop.

102
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,490
That means Kyoshiro hired them to oppose me.

103
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,170
It'll be trouble if we go up against Otose.

104
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,460
I heard our Big boss is in love with that old lady.

105
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,770
Isn't that in the past?

106
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,200
I heard she didn't talk to him for more than ten years

107
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,840
because he was late passing around the neighborhood notebook.

108
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,190
Ah! Aniki! Did you see the way the puppies move? They're like plush toys!

109
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,980
I told you not to speak so loud!

110
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,150
Meru-chan is in her most fragile state right now.

111
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,450
What? Another one came out.

112
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,030
Calm down!

113
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,670
But this pup isn't breathing!

114
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,150
What? Hey what is this? What's going on? What should we do?!

115
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,310
Please, Aniki! Do something. I can't take this.

116
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,640
I can't take it either.

117
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,840
Men shouldn't panic!

118
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,520
If you don't pull yourselves together, who's going to look after this pup?!

119
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,890
A man has to be strong at times like this!

120
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,020
I-I'm sorry.

121
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,000
You there! Get me a clean washcloth! A clean one, now!

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Right!

123
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,240
Brought it!

124
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,200
Old lady. How is he, old lady? Will he live?

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,110
Will Meru-chan's baby live?

126
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,940
It cried. It's alive!

127
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,190
It's a miracle.

128
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,010
Thank you, old lady. Thank you so much.

129
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,320
Forget it. Take good care of it now.

130
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,860
I will.

131
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,100
Old lady, what're you doing here?

132
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,390
I heard you said something about someone giving birth.

133
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,540
In times like this, nothing gets done if a mother isn't around.

134
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,510
That's so true.

135
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,270
That's true.

136
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,450
That's not true!

137
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,770
Who are you, old lady?

138
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,710
Mother.

139
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,950
Hachiro's mother.

140
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,330
Hachiro... That Hachiro?

141
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,000
Hachiro Kuroita.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Hachiro Kuroita?

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,920
Hachiro Kuroita... I've heard that name before.

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Big boss!

145
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,540
Sakata-san. Sakata-san!

146
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,000
Hachiro-san! How'd it go? Did you find Mom?

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,780
I had no luck.

148
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,910
Neither did I.

149
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,010
It's not only Mom, but I lost contact with Kyoshiro. He left the club to chase after her.

150
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,010
Crap!

151
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,840
Because of this, we were completely fooled.

152
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,210
None of us imagined that Kyoshiro-san was the old lady's son.

153
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,660
He's changed so much. Not even his mother or the Buddha would recognize him.

154
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,400
And you, dressed like that and calling yourself Hachiro.

155
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,050
It'd be strange if we didn't think you were her son.

156
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,040
Lies, exaggerations, confusion! I'm calling JARO.

157
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,040
[Note: JARO stands for the Japan Advertising Review Organization]

158
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,160
That was your own mistake.

159
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,390
But first of all, I'm not a son.

160
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,280
I may not look it, but I'm a former daughter.

161
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,020
I'm a trannie. Hachiro is my professional name.

162
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,020
My real name is Hanako.

163
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,400
Hanako...

164
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,230
What?

165
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,260
Hanako...?

166
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,990
Yes.

167
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,440
Hanako is...

168
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,730
Hachiro and...

169
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,890
Hachiro is...

170
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,400
Hanako?!

171
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,920
Yes.

172
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,130
But why didn't Kyoshiro-san say anything to his mother?

173
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,960
Is it because now they are like strangers to each other?

174
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,540
Kyoshiro-san has been supposedly sending his money home to his mother for five years.

175
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,720
He wanted to see her more than anyone.

176
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,610
To make it to the top in this town, you need more than just appearances.

177
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,470
It's embarrassing to say, but we're all people who can't face our parents.

178
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,710
Yes?

179
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,340
Hello. Kyoshiro-san? It's Katsuo.

180
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,370
That old lady who was at your place...

181
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,780
For some reason, she just followed us on her own.

182
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,220
We don't know what to do with her.

183
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,450
She kept saying "I'm Hachiro's mother, I'm Hachiro's mother."

184
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,690
What should we do with her? Can we just get rid of her?

185
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,950
If you don't want that to happen, come get her right away.

186
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,360
If you dawdle, there's no telling what we might do to her.

187
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,600
Got that, Hachiro Kuroita-han?

188
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,540
Over here, over here, Kyoshiro-han. I mean, Hachiro-han.

189
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,420
I was surprised when the Big boss told me.

190
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,140
I understand your real name is Hachiro Kuroita.

191
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,280
Where is she?!

192
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,690
Don't worry. She's a valuable hostage.

193
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,550
We haven't done anything to her.

194
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll keep the fact that you're her son under wraps.

195
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,100
We yakuza act according to our principles.

196
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,580
But I don't understand why you're so desperate to hide that.

197
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,440
I've gone so bad, there's no saving me.

198
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,050
I could never face my mother. But you're different.

199
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,790
You're the top host in this town. The most successful.

200
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,950
You should proudly stand before your mother.

201
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,250
What am I going to face her with?

202
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,000
I've gotten rid of the face my mother knows.

203
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,760
In exchange for pushing my way to the top, I've thrown away being Hachiro.

204
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,500
You can call me the top host, but that's just a title.

205
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,760
I live here in the same town as you.

206
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,740
I do the same sort of dirty things.

207
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,380
No, no, you're a fine fellow.

208
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,930
You're the first guy who's refused our demands and stuck to his guns.

209
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,790
Even if that does end as of today.

210
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,920
Huh?

211
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,480
What's that money for?

212
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,750
This is everything I own.

213
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,360
But I used a lot in expanding my club, so there's not much left.

214
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,580
What? You're still putting up a fight? We don't want such trifles.

215
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,970
We want you to let us run your club!

216
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,200
I have pride in my work as a host.

217
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,250
That's why I can't accept your demands,

218
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,170
and why I have no intention of submitting to you in front of my mother.

219
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,310
You...!

220
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,800
A host's job is to make women happy.

221
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,390
That's why I absolutely cannot do anything that would make women,

222
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,090
who are the most precious things in this world, unhappy.

223
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,090
What?! You mean you don't care what happens to your mom?

224
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,190
Kyoshiro-han. You're quite dauntless.

225
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,720
Just as I would have expected of the top host.

226
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,170
Truth is, I don't like being too pushy.

227
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,500
But I don't have a choice since the Big boss is desperate

228
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,920
to develop more sources of money.

229
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,630
Since the Amanto arrived, the yakuza have changed.

230
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,690
But with that money, I might be able to convince the Big boss.

231
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,160
I'll let you go today in deference to your 7:3-parted hair and your dauntlessness.

232
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,690
I'll release Mom after that.

233
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,570
What the?!

234
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,180
Guys like him don't deserve your money.

235
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,910
Use it to treat your mother to something delicious.

236
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,420
You're...!

237
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,760
I'm not very good with machines.

238
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,870
This isn't looking good! Let's get out of here.

239
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,260
Just - do it! Do it! Do it!

240
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,110
Do it! Do it!

241
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,460
What crazy people. I can't distinguish them from the yakuza.

242
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,310
Hey, that's enough. Or this old lady gets...

243
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,780
This old lady gets...

244
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,510
I've got the old lady, fuu.

245
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,920
No you don't!

246
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,100
You fool! Don't underestimate me!

247
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,560
It's unmanly to chase after a woman who left you, fuu-fuu.

248
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,500
Ouch.

249
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,600
What kind of one-sided interpretation is that?

250
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,830
Were you sent by that old lady Otose or something?

251
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,320
Ouch.

252
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,960
You think you can go up against our Gutter Rat Gang in this town and stay alive?

253
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,300
You fool!

254
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,130
If you make an enemy of...

255
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,300
Boss Jirocho, you'll...

256
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,270
A clean hit!

257
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,410
Uh-oh... I feel dizzy...

258
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,900
What did this old lady eat?

259
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,990
I mustn't let go. Tough it out.

260
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,850
What're you blushing for?!

261
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't give a damn if you're gutter rats or lab rats.

262
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,570
Don't go bothering the mice who've pushed their way through the gutter mud, desperately trying...

263
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,530
to make a living.

264
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,030
Meru-chan!

265
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,850
Aniki!

266
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,500
Boss?

267
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,120
Let them go. Let them go.

268
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,720
We don't have enough lives to take these guys on. If we...

269
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,310
back out now, I'm sure Big boss would understand.

270
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,060
But...!

271
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,400
As Gutter Rats, we live by our rules.

272
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,460
I never fail when returning a debt of gratitude.

273
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,400
I borrow 7, I'll return 3.

274
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:40,120
The same goes for revenge. If I take 3, I'll give back 7. Remember that.

275
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,260
Kyoshiro's doing as well as ever.

276
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,490
Did you hear? Kyoshiro-san never did identify himself to his mother after all.

277
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,900
Remember! You boil that pumpkin in soy sauce and broth!

278
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,530
Come on! How many times are you going to tell me the same thing?!

279
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,040
Don't raise your voice! You're always trying to trip me up!

280
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,040
He says he still hasn't become a man who can meet her with his head held high.

281
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,660
Even though he hasn't done a single thing to be ashamed of.

282
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,050
That's so true.

283
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,810
I know him. I know how pure a heart he has.

284
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,080
I've been at his side watching him, all this time.

285
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,840
Hachiro-san.

286
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,200
This odd box was left at the door.

287
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,960
Remember! You mustn't over-boil it! It'll turn mushy! Just enough!

288
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,160
Come on! How many times are you going to tell me the same thing?!

289
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,010
Don't raise your voice! You're always trying to trip me up!

290
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,150
Oh, Kyoshiro-san!

291
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,360
What's this?

292
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,990
Just a minute! We didn't order this!

293
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,930
Why're you smiling?

294
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,090
It's our special service.

295
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,200
Remember! Chew your food well!

296
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,260
Come on! How many times are you going to tell me the same thing?!

297
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,240
It's the first time I've said that! You're not going to trick me!

298
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,390
What is this? Who wants something so lame?

299
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,970
Kyoshiro-san wouldn't eat something like this.

300
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,150
Okay, then, I'm leaving. After I'm gone, make sure you lock up!

301
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,810
It's dangerous, these days.

302
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,090
Come on! Hurry up and leave!

303
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,080
See you, old lady. Sweet dreams.

304
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,080
You too, brat!

305
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,740
See you, then.

306
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,970
Uh! Mom...

307
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,330
I'm sorry we couldn't help you, after all.

308
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,350
What're you talking about?

309
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,610
[To Hachiro, From Mother]

310
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,650
You did let me see him.

311
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,280
Dear Hachiro,

312
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,470
First of all, you're still not very good with chopsticks.

313
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,770
I've told you to fix that. Mother is quite concerned.

314
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,060
And another thing, don't make munching noises when you eat.

315
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,890
It really irritates Mother.

316
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,390
And finally... I don't know the details, but...

317
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,040
Mother is just happy to know you're doing well.

318
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,170
No matter what happens,

319
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,440
your mother will always be proud of you.

320
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,380
Mom...

321
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,250
That annoying woman is finally gone.

322
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,750
Now I know that a Mom is nothing if not annoying.

323
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,990
True.

324
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,120
I agree.

325

Damn! It's a raid!

328
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,510
Run!

329
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,740
Too!

330
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,940
I-It's the Shinsengumi!

331

Shichiro Kiyokawa,

332
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,490
you're under arrest for the bombing of the Planet Kinmoku Embassy,

333
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,490
murder of Shogunate officials and destruction of a coffee shop.

334
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,310
You're the ones who busted up the coffee shop!

335
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,130
What's going on?

336
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,310
It's the Shinsengumi!

337
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,490
The Shinsengumi's at it again!

338
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,160
[The Shinsengumi's At It Again]

339
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,540
Oh...

340
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,890
Tsu Terakado won the New Singer Award at the Edo CD Grand Prix.

341
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,890
Amazing.

342
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,210
Not that. The article above it.

343
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,240
Oh... Serial kidnappings of women, eh? How frightening.

344
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,630
But Otae-san is safe for sure.

345
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,850
Not that. The article to the right.

346
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,140
Oh... Sogo did it again, eh? You take the responsibility, okay?

347
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,880
No, no. It's your fault.

348
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:32,230
All crimes result from vulnerabilities in your heart!

349
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,400
It's something you could say about both those

350
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,330
who commit crimes and those who are its victims, wouldn't you say?

351
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,390
What I want to say is that depending on your mental attitude

352
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,160
you can prevent a crime before it happens.

353
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,610
What I want to say is:

354
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,530
don't get into too festive a mood just because it's spring!

355
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,350
That's what I want to say!

356
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,160
However, it's darn near impossible for us to protect the peace

357
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,590
in Edo without everyone's cooperation!

358
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,250
Listen to me, everyone!

359
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,310
At this time when everyone is in a festive mood,

360
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,120
we need to lock down and beware of terrorists! That's right!

361
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:10,240
What's the matter? You have no spirit. Come on, shout out!

362
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,510
In this festive time, we need to lock down and beware of terrorists! Sell your kidneys!

363
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,880
Sell your kidneys, dammit!

364
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,370
Good afternoon.

365
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:27,250
I'm Chief of the Shinsengumi for a day, Tsu Terakado!

366
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,710
Everybody! Don't get carried away by the festive mood just because it's spring.

367
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,100
Elephant turds are huge!

368
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,340
They're huge!

369
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,310
I will do all I can to protect the peace in Edo today.

370
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,100
Help me out, okay? Cat poop smells awful!

371
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,760
Awful!

372
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,180
Okay, then, listen to this song!

373
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,010
"Chome-ko Nanza Kuso Kurae!"

Toshi, I'm glad we invited her, after all. Neapolitan.

376
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,750
Hell no! Rocky III "The Flames of Friendship"!

377
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,750
[Note: It was actually the Japan release version of Rocky IV that had the additional title "Flames of Friendship"]

378

Chome Chome Chome Chome Ko!
