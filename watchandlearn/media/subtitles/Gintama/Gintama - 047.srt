It's a d-d-dream...

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,010
Huh? I can't move.

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,940
It's no use...

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,500
Huh? Could it be?

[Note: Kanasibari means to be bound and paralyzed by a ghost.]

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,810
Could it be kanashibari? Is it kanashibari?

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,280
Huh? Wh-Wh-What's going on?

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,350
Nah, can't be...

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,930
C-C-Could it be ghosts...

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,760
Ohh...I don't believe in that. I absolutely don't believe in that.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,170
I'm not afraid. How can I be... I'm the star.

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,480
Once upon a time, I was called the White Demon and the people were afraid of me.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,250
I can't be afraid of a ghost.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,420
Hey, Kagura! I have no voice? I'm talking, but nothing's coming out.

16
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:16,300
Hey! Hey! I'm having trouble breathing. I'm struggling to breathe.

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,470
Is it a ghost, after all? Is it the ghost's doing?

18
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,110
I take back what I said. I do believe in ghosts!

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,380
Hey, is someone there? Ghost, are you there?

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,250
I was wrong. So please release me from the ghost paralysis. Please! I'm begging you!

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,580
Help! Help me please!

Hey, it's morning...

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,080
I can't move... I haven't moved...

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,920
Am I going to be like this for the rest of my life?

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,730
Ghost-san, please answer me! Ghost-san! Ghost-san! Ghost-san!

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,070
Good morning.

Oh, Shinpachi. Shinpachi! Help me!

Shinpachi. Shinpachi! Shinpachi!

My voice isn't coming out. I'm talking, but I have no voice.

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,180
Morning, Shinpachi.

33
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,570
Kagura...it doesn't matter who... Save me. Save me. Please. Save me.

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,940
You look sleepy. Morning, Kagura-chan.

35
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,440
Huh? Where's Gin-chan? Is Gin-chan still asleep?

36
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:25,160
That's right. Gin-san's suffering from ghost paralysis.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,670
Shall I wake him up?

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,670
Hurry and come here!

39
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,430
No, never mind. Gin-san's in kanashibari.

40
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,570
What?! How do you know?

41
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,610
How do you know? Why won't you save me even though you know?

42
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,590
Kanashibari? What is kanashibari?

43
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,350
It's a ghost paralysis. You're awake, but your body can't move.

44
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,680
It's a very convenient state for the animators.

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,770
Convenient?

46
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,890
Seems all the anime staff are taking a trip to Kinugawa Hot Spa,

47
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,780

Oh, I'm free of the ghost paralysis.

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,870
Anime staff! You think you can get away with such laziness?!

It's so irritating.

66
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,830
The pollen this year is worse than normal.

67

Everyone on the street is sniffling and suffering from the pollen. I wonder why.

68

Seems it's not cedar pollen.

69

Doesn't seem like inside or outside makes any difference. Where is this pollen coming from?

86
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,400
It might be coming from someplace close by. But there aren't many plants in Kabukicho...

The name's Hedoro.

100

It's written "He" as in fart, "do" as in angry, and "ro" as in Robinmask.

What's with that? He's releasing all kinds of pollen into the air.

Well, this explains Edo's pollen allergy epidemic.

But he said he was a florist.

Don't be ridiculous!

No matter how you look at him, that face is here to conquer Earth!

118
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,240
During the day, he's a florist. But at night, he works on his real job of world domination.

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,110
This is way worse than good girl by day, naughty girl by night.

What? It's gonna explode?!

127

What? Poison gas?!

Sadaharu! I can't just leave him in there!!

130

140
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,250
He really is a florist.

141
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,990
Who'd come to buy from him? Such a scary shop.

142
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,250
But he seems to be having so much fun.

143
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,310
He doesn't look at all like he's here to conquer Earth.

144
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,850
Of course he's happy.

145
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,760
He's growing devil flowers that will be the vanguard troops to conquer Earth.

146
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
More importantly, how will we pass him the Neighborhood Notebook?

No way! It's me?

You don't have to hand it to him personally.

152

You don't have to do anything dangerous. Act like Passerby A and leave it as you walk by.

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,610
W-Wait a minute!

154
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,060
There's no Passerby A, or B or C or D.

155
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,350
Everyone's too scared to walk around. Passerby A will clearly stand out big time.

156

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,130
Chan.

160
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,010
Chan.

161
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,180
There are no such passersby B and C!

162
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh crap! Hedoro's watching. Hedoro's looking right at them!

163
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,560
B! C! They're being watched! B! C!

164
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,780
What hard luck I've had.

165
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,180
After losing my wife, my son...

166
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,230
Chan.

167
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,270
This is all he can say.

168
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,280
Chan.

169
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,360
He really means father, not "Chan."

170
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,510
After losing his mother, he's had no one but me to rely on.

171
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,290
It can't be helped. But what will I do if he doesn't learn more words? For example...

172
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,550
Chan. Chan chanko chan. Let me chan.

173
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,550
[Note: Chan-chan-ko is like a padded vest.]

174
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,230
What? What? Say that again?

175
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,090
Life won't be easy like this.

176
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:36,310
But I wonder if I should fix it. It feels good to be called "Chan, chan"-I feel like I'm respected.

177
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,110
What should I do?

178
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,210
Father didn't know. Daijiro's only word, "Chan," did not mean "Father."

179
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,210
[Note: This is a spoof of Lone Wolf and Cub.]

180
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,410
Mother had often told Father:

181
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,180
"You need to chanto! Our budget is really tight."

182
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,180
[Note: Chanto means "work like you're supposed to"]

183
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,950
That's what "Chan" meant.

184
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,980
It had nothing to do with Daijiro loving Father or anything like that.

185
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,920
Chan.

186
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,960
We don't need any of that superfluous storyline!

187
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,200
Huh? Is Hedoro crying?!

188
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,100
I'm not quite sure, but now's my chance!

189
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Here's the Neighborhood Notebook!

190
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,910
This is trouble, big trouble, humongous trouble.

191
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,820
He's sharpening his knife. It's like a Japanese fairy tale.

192
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,190
Chan. Will we be eaten up, chan?

193
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,180
My, I appreciate all three of you coming all the way out here

194
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,090
just to bring the Neighborhood Notebook.

195
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,460
Please make yourselves at home. I'll prepare something to snack on.

196
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,460
He's going to snack on us!

197
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,970
He's definitely going to snack on us!

198
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,300
Uh...er...um...Hedoro-san, I mean Hedoro-sama.

199
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,340
No, just plain Hedoro is fine.

200
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,040
Uh...I'm sorry about earlier.

201
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,780
I hit you with the notebook.

202
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,190
The strap on my sandal thong broke and... I know this sounds like an excuse, but it's the truth.

203
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,350
No, forget it. It was an accident. An accident.

204
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,010
More importantly, don't they say a sandal thong breaking is a bad omen?

205
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,530
I hope nothing bad happens.

206
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,710
He's about to do something evil.

207
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,030
He's about to bring us bad luck.

208
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,560
Uh...Hedoro-sama? I mean Duke Hedoro.

209
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,870
No, just Hedoro will do.

210
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,330
Uh...we appreciate you entertaining us,

211
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,480
but I just received word that my father is in critical condition, so we have to leave immediately...

212
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,880
What?

213
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,890
Why didn't you say so sooner?

214
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm concerned, too. Would you mind if I came along?

215
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,880
He plans on coming with us!

216
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,650
He plans to follow us to the depths of hell and put us in critical condition.

217
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,860
He's planning to put us in critical condition.

218
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,510
Uh...no, it's all right. Dad was a rotten father anyway.

219
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:16,370
What? Is that so? And just when I thought I'd bring some of my flowers as a get-well gift.

220
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,600
No, really, it doesn't matter. In fact, I'm hoping the funeral comes quickly.

221
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,480
Is that so? By all means, please use my flowers for the funeral.

222
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,040
I grew these flowers with my heart and soul.

223
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,980
I'm sure they'll lead your father to the land of Perfect Bliss.

224
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,420
Lead him to?

225
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,150
Not just his father, but the entire planet.

226
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,090
He's leading us to the land of Perfect Bliss!

227
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,320
Hedoro-san, why did you become a florist?

228
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,730
I don't look the part, do I?

229
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,560
No, that wasn't what I meant...

230
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,780
It's all right. I'm fully aware of it! Especially because of the way I look...

231
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,990
I've always wished I could be a flower.

232
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,920
People always feared me because of the way I look.

233
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,840
So I thought I'd make at least my heart as nice as a flower.

234
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,010
That's why I want to be as close as possible to flowers.

235
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,040
But it seems it doesn't fit me, after all. I haven't had a single customer yet.

236
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:25,260
Sakata-san, you and your friends are the only ones who weren't afraid of me.

237
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,260
Sorry, but...

238
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,210
We're absolutely frightened of you.

239
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,810
Gin-san... Do you think maybe Hedoro-san is actually a nice person?

240
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,350
No. The "Gap Rule" applies.

241
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,810
"Gap Rule"?

242
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,180
When someone with a ducktail hairstyle

243
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,510
does something nice once in a while, his image goes up.

244
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,120
Contrarily, when someone who is ordinarily nice

245
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,660
does something even a little wrong, he becomes a villain.

246
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,880
That's the "Gap Rule".

247
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,290
So, what do you think I am?! That makes me a devil in human skin!

248
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,350
Which means, Hedoro is actually...

249
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,040
Wrong! He looks nothing if not hungry! Tonight's dinner is meow-burger.

250
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,730
You guys are too easily fooled when his appearance doesn't match his actions.

251
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,340
"You can't trust a book by its cover" is what stupid people say. First impressions...

252
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,520
are what you need to believe! Be inspired. Feel with imagination!

253
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,580
Okay, Kagura! What do you think will be in that pot in a few hours?

254
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,800
Uh...lots of hot rice?

255
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,750
Wrong! This is where we have a problem!

256
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,300
I'll show you the correct answer!

257
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,540
[A few hours later]

258
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,060
Oh! I think it's just about ready.

259
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,860
Did you see it? Could you see it? What our future looks like?

260
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,360
It's pitch black. No headlights or anything!

261
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,490
Forgive me for keeping you waiting. I'm not very good at this.

262
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,730
No, no, no take your time. Take forever.

263
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:04,740
Feel free to lie down. Make yourselves at home.

264
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,970
When I'm done, I'll wake you up.

265
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,070
Shinpachi! You know what that means, don't you? What'll happen if we fall asleep?

266
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,810
Yes! If we fall asleep, we'll be attacked and end up in the pot! We'll be in the miso soup!

267
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,550
Hey!

268
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,050
Huh? The more you say not to fall asleep, the sleepier I become.

269
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,550
Is this like what happens the day before a test?

270
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,740
If you're aware of it, don't fall asleep!

271
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,790
We have no time to lose.

272
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,280
I'll create a diversion to draw his attention! You run like hell!

273
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,570
Gin-san.

274
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,000
Look at that.

275
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,290
That's...

276
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,810
JUMP...used to keep his fridge level?

277
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,900
JUMP stirs the dreams and adventurous spirit of all men.

278
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,660
Anyone who treats it like that

279
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,620
is evil!

280
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,850
What kind of reasoning is that?!

281
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,420
Are you all right, Sakata-san?

282
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,270
That was close...

283
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,140
You were just about to step on a ladybug. Killing is wrong.

284
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,760
Watch where you're going, you two.

285
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,350
You nearly knocked over these daisies.

286
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,950
Killing is wrong.

287
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,050
Give me inner strength...

288
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,660
Inner strength...

289
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,600
Hedoro!

290
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,570
We're not letting you

291
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,200
take over the Earth!

292
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,700
Gin-san, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I gave in.

293
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,470
All I can think of is sacrificing you so I can survive.

294
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,700
Out of my way!

295
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,480
I can't worry about others when my life hangs in the balance!

296
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,220
That's totally cruel!

297
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,550
Just tell him, "Gin-chan, I'll live your share for you, so rest in peace"!

298
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,480
You're sinister. Sinister, I say!

299
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,350
He's coming! He's coming!

300
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,190
Which means, Gin-san is already...

301
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,260
No!

302
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,630
Gin-san? What about the Earth?! Weren't you going to protect Earth?

303
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,260
My life before Earth!

304
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,200
What's with that?!

305
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,740
What's with this house?! Where's the exit?

306
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,140
It's a trap. The house itself is a trap!

307
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,140
There! Over there!

308
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,450
Ow ow...

309
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,420
What's the matter, Shinpachi?

310
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,830
O-Over there...

311
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,030
An altar!

312
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,560
It is, isn't it? An altar. A sacrificial altar, right there.

313
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,100
No! I don't want to die yet!

314
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,660
But why is there an altar here?

315
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,160
Idiot! It's obvious.

316
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,270
It's to make a pact with the Devil and achieve eternal life.

317
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,860
[Bedroom]

318
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,870
That's right. Eternal leaf...

319
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,690
Sakata-san, where did you go?

320
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,570
That's odd. I thought I heard something around here.

321
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Maybe I was wrong. I have to find them quickly.

322
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,390
So they weren't here...

323
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,850
I found you!

324
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,070
Run!

325
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,210
No! I don't want to die a virgin!

326
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,980
Shinpachi! If you sacrifice yourself, everything will be okay!

327
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,880
What?! Don't decide that by yourself!

328
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,850
We'll live your share for you!

329
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,520
You're saying the same thing!

330
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,680
Wait!

331
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,210
He's coming! Climbing up!

332
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,430
Then go down!

333
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,190
By yourself!

334
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,090
Are you people demons?!

335
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,530
That's the demon!

336
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,430
Please wait!

337
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,860
The demon!

338
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,830
Look there! A way out!

339
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,420
What's this?!

340
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,290
Were we this high up?

341
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,230
Sakata-san.

342
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,420
I finally caught up with you.

343
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,410
Shinpachi. Kagura. It's been nice knowing you...

344
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,610
Gin-san...

345
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,720
Gin-chan...

346
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,920
If the three of us team up, then we'll have a chance.

347
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,810
Let's end this right.

348
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,510
Let's protect the city of Edo...and the Earth.

349
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,030
Yes. That's the one last thing we can do.

350
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,750
Let's go!

351
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,640
Okay!

352
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,950
Oh, a drone beetle.

353
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm glad... Are you all okay?

354
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,340
Yes.

355
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,350
Thank you very much.

356
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,540
And from that day on, Earth lived on peacefully and was not conquered.

357
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,580
And in the streets of Edo, the pollen continued to swirl about.

358
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,180
If there was one thing that did change...

371
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,640
I feel horrible.

372
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,740
Why am I running into that guy everywhere on my day off?

373
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,770
Why is that?

374
