Umm... This is a question from Coffee Lover in Tottori Prefecture.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,440
"Good day, Sensei. I've been wondering about this for a while.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,370
All the characters in GinTama are based off real people from the Edo Period.

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,770
Who is Gin-san based off of?"

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,550
Here's your answer. It's Kintoki Sakata.

[Kintoki Sakata]

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,620
He's the famous Kintaro-san from folklore.

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,320
He's not from the Edo Period, but the Heian Period.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,580
In one story, he's the son of a mountain hag and has peerless strength.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,240
He used to wrestle bears in the folktales.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,480
Afterwards, he became one of Minamoto no Yorimitsu's four guardians.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,060
He is said to have defeated the demon, Shutendoji of Ooe Yama.

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,870
But Gin-san isn't a descendant of Kintaro.

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,520
He was just modeled a bit after him. Don't be too concerned about it.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,400
That aside, what's with that conceptual art?

Once more? That man has been revived dozens of times!!

158
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,110
I see... Is his younger brother with the inferiority complex still thriving?

159
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,180
What a terrible thing to say! What do you know about Luigi?!

160
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,740
Anyway, how can you come here without a disguise?

161
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,250
Did you forget that you're a wanted criminal?

162
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,850
No police officers would have the time to come to a place like this at this hour.

163
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,530
I guess some revolutionaries have a lot of free time.

164
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,870
I'm very sorry, sirs...

165
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,770
Your bath is bothering the other customers...

166
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,220
What of it? We've been in line all night.

167
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,200
We should at least be able to take a bath.

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,150
Stop, Sogo. Sorry, I'll be finished soon.

169
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,910
I still haven't washed myself down there, yet...

170
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,380
No, I'm going to call the police.

171
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,440
No, we are the police.

172
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,070
I said, I'm calling the police...

173
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,520
I said, we're...

174
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,210
No, just...

175
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,240
No, just...

176
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,860
Umm, just...

177
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,250
J-Just...

178
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,500
Just a moment! I still haven't washed myself down there yet!!

179
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,540
Just how rude can some people get?

180
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,150
Some people will try anything to cut in line.

181
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,370
Tsk... I never expected to run into the Shinsengumi here.

182
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,080
An unbelievable performance by a bunch of idiots.

183
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,910
Oh, they noticed us!!

184
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,690
Zura, hide in the kotatsu immediately.

185
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,820
I'm not Zura, I'm Katsura.

186
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,610
What are you doing here?

187
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,570
I'm batting that question right back at you.

188
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,970
I'm batting that question right back at you.

189
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,030
I'm batting that...

190
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,560
Enough. It's getting annoying.

191
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,970
Ugh... Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...

192
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,870
Oh, a kotatsu.

193
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,130
Let us in for a second!

194
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,870
Hey! Don't come in without permission!!

195
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,420
Don't be so stingy!! It's not a big deal!!

196
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,060
Oh, what's this? Did you come to buy a game console, too?

197
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,110
You sure have a lot of free time.

198
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,510
Kondo-san, that applies to us, too. Please stop.

199
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,500
Unfortunately, this shop only has a hundred game consoles in stock.

200
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,050
That's right. They'll run out at just about the place where Toshi is standing in line.

201
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,750
Unfortunately, you won't get a game console.

202
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,570
Too bad.

203
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,450
We've been in line since yesterday morning. Right, Toshi?

204
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,800
Huh? Why are you here, Toshi?

205
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,290
It's cold.

206
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,590
Don't say that!! Why aren't you holding our place in line?!

207
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,760
Hey! Now all our standing in line since yesterday has gone to waste!!

208
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,540
What are we going to do?! I made a promise to Otae-san!!

209
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,110
Get an OwEe for all the hostess club hostesses. If you don't, I'll flick your eyeballs.

210
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,970
That's not a promise!! That's a threat!!

211
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,480
Kondo-san, don't worry. Yamazaki is holding my place in line.

212
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,820
Hijikata-san, Yamazaki is...

213
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,700
Over there playing Kabaddi.

214
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,720
Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi...

215
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,720
[Note: Kabaddi is a popular sport in South Asia.]

216
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,780
Yamazaki!! Who are these people?!

217
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,670
It's now midnight! The Bentendo OwEe is now on sale!

218
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,300
Stay in line. Don't panic or run.

219
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,120
Follow the employees' directions. One per person...

220
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,790
Are you listening to me?!

221
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,920
It doesn't matter!! This world is all about survival of the fittest!

222
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,230
All right! I got an OwEe!

223
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,970
I won't let you have it.

224
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,750
You bastard...

225
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm going to get the OwEe!!

226
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,970
I'm not letting you!!

227
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,340
I'm going to...

228
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,170
Get the OwEe!!

229
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,790
I've got it!!

230
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,780
I won't let you have it!!

231
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,860
The OwEe is mine!

232
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,800
Whoa... Six people charged into the store and customers are following them.

233
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,550
This is dangerous. This is really dangerous.

234
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,000
A riot!! They've become a rioting mob!!

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,670
If something is not done right away, something terrible will happen.

236
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,010
The OwEe might be pulled from the sale!!

237
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,770
I'm going to talk to Yamada-san of the Bentendo public relations department.

238
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,020
What do you think? Did you expect that this would happen?

239
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,770
Well, pretty much...

240
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,600
The OwEe release date was delayed several times.

241
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,640
Everyone probably couldn't wait any longer.

242
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,240
Do you think the OwEe will be pulled from the sale if someone gets hurt?

243
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,630
It'll be all right. We have a plan.

244
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,630
It will be solved peacefully...

245
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,060
And it's a great way to demonstrate how it works.

246
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,120
Wha?! What is that?!

247
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,610
It's a giant TV screen.

248
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,820
And an OwEe!!

249
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,010
Do you all want this game console that badly?!

250
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,190
Then win it by playing a game!! Get what you want by playing a game!

251
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,060
That's what a true gamer would do!!

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,310
Do you all want...

253
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,080
...this game console that badly?!

254
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,310
Then win it by playing a game!! Get what you want by playing a game!

255
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,280
That's what a true gamer would do!!

256
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,520
Who is that?

257
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,030
The manager.

258
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:16,190
How about participating in a little challenge to win the OwEe?

259
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,200
You chosen gamers here...

260
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,200
You energetic gamers who rushed in first...

261
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,440
I'm going to split you up into two teams and you have to play games against each other.

262
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,240
Hey, what is he saying?

263
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,710
Naturally, I'll give the winning team OwEes for free.

264
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,750
Really?!

265
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,590
You are chosen individuals. It's only natural.

266
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,590
I want the remaining spectators to predict which team is going to win...

267
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,440
Those who bet on the winning team...

268
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,420
...will get the right to buy the OwEe.

269
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,700
We'll be sure to get you an OwEe even if we don't have enough in stock.

270
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,130
What do you think? Sounds like fun, right?

271
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,980
That doesn't sound like fun!

272
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,210
I was standing in a spot in line where I would've been guaranteed an OwEe!!

273
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,660
What are you going to do about that?!

274
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,950
You're the manager!!

275
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,250
Aren't you embarrassed to be dressed up like that at your age?!

276
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,390
You damn kids!!

277
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,660
All you do is play video games...

278
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,690
Work, you idiots!! Stop playing video games, stupid!! Die!!

279
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,010
The manager has become himself again.

280
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,490
He's saying things that won't benefit him.

281
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,790
Hey, kids.

282
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,200
Do you want that game console that badly?

283
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,700
Then bet on us.

284
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,440
We'll win the OwEe. 100% guaranteed.

285
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,730
They're not normal people!

286
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,950
They look like Master Takahashi! All their chins are turned up!!

287
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,950
[Note: Takahashi Meijin is a famous video game player from the 80s.]

288
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,500
Hey, is it all right to be making your decision so soon?

289
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,280
You'll just get hurt...

290
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,860
Whoa!! Their chins are turned up, too! But the second guy looks embarrassed!

291
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,180
He's no good!

292
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,970
What are you saying, you idiot?!

293
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,800
[Note: Hijikata is imitating Antonio Inoki, a famous professional wrestler in Japan. Inoki is also known for his turned up chin.]

294
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,800
He's no good! He's got it all wrong. He's someone else!

295
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,830
Damn it!!

296
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,360
What did you say?! Damn kids, give up video games! Die, stupid! Just die!

297
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
You die.

298
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,810
Hey! This has completely turned into a match of the upturned chins!

299
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,440
This looks kind of interesting. I'll place a bet!!

300
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,080
Me, too!!

301
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,640
Me, too!

302
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,790
Me, too!

303
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,790
Wow! Impressed by their unique personalities, the customers are placing bets.

304
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,600
Hmm... This is a great advertising scheme.

305
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,230
It introduces the game console.

306
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,280
I see. So this is what you were going for, Yamada-san.

307
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,510
The first battle is...

308
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,040
A girl game battle.

You play the main character.

312
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,550
The person who bonks the heroine first...

313
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,330
...is the winner!

00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,690
A girl game? I've never played one of those.

316
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,660
What does he mean by "bonk the heroine"?

317
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:09,890
[Note: Parody of the Legendary Tree from Tokimeki Memorial game.
At the end of the game, one girl shows up at the tree to confess her love.]

318
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,080
Does it have something to do with a legendary cliff?

319
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,890
No it doesn't. The point of the game is to become romantic with a girl.

320
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,770
This is bad. I haven't played many of these games.

321
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,930
This match is decided.

322
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,880
I've played every girl game ever created and I've bonked countless women.

323
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,140
Otae-san even said that I should have been born in 2D instead of 3D.

324
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,930
For me, Isao Kondo,

325
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,650
fifteen minutes is enough for me to take on one or two heroines.

326
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,330
She's not praising you.
She's telling you to die.

327
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,430
I've played countless girl games.

328
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,750
I can tell which choices the girls will like

329
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,540
and what the best date spots are even in the new games.

330
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,580
If only you could do that in real life.

331
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,210
My skill at using a controller doesn't waste a minute.

332
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,400
Do you think you can keep up?

333
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,320
Who's that?!

334
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,660
You don't waste a minute?

335
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,800
How silly. Don't you know that love itself is all about excess?

336
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,820
You get excessively excited, and excessively uneasy.

337
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,110
You struggle excessively. And it all ends in vain.

338
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:27,890
Nobody will say that it's a waste. No, love is all about excess!!

339
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,210
Wh-Who are you?!

340
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm just an ordinary plumber.

341
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,010
Whoa!! A man who calls himself a plumber has suddenly barged into this challenge!

342
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,620
Who is this man?!

343
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,890
Who is he?!

344
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,840
Hey! That mushroom... Could he be the world's most famous plumber, Mari...

345
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,570
I'm not Mario. I'm Katsu-

346
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,430
This is bad! My mustache... my mustache...

347
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,680
What are you doing, Katsura-san?!

348
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,720
Did you come out just to get caught?!

349
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,530
I heard that I could win a free Twin Famicom.

350
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,390
They don't have those anymore!

351
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,490
Anyway, how badly do you want a Twin Famicom?!

352
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,760
They'll see through your flimsy disguise in no time!

353
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,990
Get away from here quickly.

354
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,260
Hey!

355
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,130
You there.

356
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,380
This is bad! We can't fool the Demon Vice-Chief's eyes!

357
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,380
I never expected to see you here.

358
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,080
What a coincidence. You're done for.

359
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,810
Umm... Also, could I get your autograph?

360
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,690
I want you to write, "From Mario. To Toshiro-kun," right here...

361
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,890
It's a miracle!! There are miraculous idiots here!!

362
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,100
Well, I don't really do signatures...

363
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,500
When I do one, a bunch of people tend to gather and there's no end to it.

364
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,230
I see. Then how about a photo? I won't show it to anyone.

365
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,710
Then how about a handshake? I'm a real Bentendo fan.

366
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,960
How clingy is he going to get?! No such creepy Mario exists.

367
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,590
Hijikata-san, wait just a second.

368
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,410
You mustn't be fooled.

369
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,550
Oh no, it's Okita-san! He's very perceptive.

370
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,120
I've never seen a Mario with such long hair.

371
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,880
I can't just stand by quietly... He's a fake.

372
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,630
The real one's over there.

373
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,930
[Give it your best, Katsuo.]

374
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,710
I've never seen a Mario like that, either!!

375
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,930
You two think that anything with a mustache is Mario, don't you?!

376
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,490
What are you, stupid?

377
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,390
That's got to be his younger brother, Luigi. He's green.

378
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,800
[Note: Parody of Sega Dreamcast.]

379
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,800
You Zega fans should be quiet and play your Creamcast, stupid.

380
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:51,320
[Note: Shenmue is a SEGA Dreamcast adventure game. The series has been on hiatus since 2001.]

381
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,350
Keep waiting for your sequel to Shenmue, stupid.

382
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,320
I'll keep on waiting no matter what anyone says. I'm sure it'll come back.

383
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,280
Both of you stop fighting.

384
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,160
Keep quiet you Zony lover.

385
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,160
[Note: Parody of Sony.]

386
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,810
They're completely fooled.

387
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,660
Gintoki...

388
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,220
Leave this to me.

389
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,700
I didn't risk coming just because I wanted a Twin Famicom.

390
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,230
Of course. There aren't any Twin Famicoms.

391
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,530
The Shinsengumi have been making us Anti-Foreigner Faction members suffer until now.

392
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,160
This is a good chance to crush them, even if it's just at a game.

393
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,860
Zura, don't screw up. It's over if they find out who you are.

394
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,260
I'm not Zura...

395
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,430
I'm Katsuo.

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,320
The first battle, the girl game challenge, will now begin!

397
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:27,640
[Preview]

398
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,170
Now then, everyone, what kind of show will these chosen individuals

399
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,100
give us in order to win the new Bentendo OwEe game console?

400
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,740
The first battle, the girl game challenge, will now begin!

401
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,110
["Life and Video Games are Full of Bugs"]

402
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:36,190
[Who will win the OwEe? Will it be the Odd Jobs team or the Shinsengumi team?!]

403
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,060
[One more episode of season 2 of the GinTama anime!! Let's keep this up until the end!!]
