00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,750
We must force them out and rebuild this country into the land of samurai once more.

165
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,270
We're expelling foreigners in order to protect this country.

166
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,560
Foreigner expulsion patriotism?!

167
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,350
What's that?

168
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,150
Foreigner Expulsion is an ideology that sprang up during the Amanto attacks twenty years ago.

169
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,260
They tried to drive out the aliens.

170
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,700
The Amanto pressured us to open up our doors.

171
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,040
Under that threat, the samurai rose up together to try to chase them out of Edo.

172
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,710
Confronted by Amanto's immense power, the government surrendered.

173
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,700
They abandoned the samurai and signed an unfair treaty with the Amanto.

174
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,400
The Amanto had control over the core of the government. They took away the samurai's swords

175
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,770
and made them powerless.

176
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,910
I heard that afterwards

177
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,210
many of the exclusionists were purged.

178
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,590
I never thought that they still existed.

179
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,780
It seems we've been manipulated.

180
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,960
Isn't that right, Mr. Postman?

181
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,350
He's right! I remember those bushy eyebrows.

182
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,700
Hold on. What's going on, bushy-brows?!

183
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,500
It's all your doing, isn't it, Katsura?

184
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,840
All these recent attacks that have everyone in a panic.

185
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,260
There was something I had to get my hands on, even if it meant dirtying them.

186
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:52,480
Gintoki, will you take up your sword alongside me in order to rebuild this corrupt country?

187
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,690
Once again, will you lend me the strength that made you feared as the White Knight?

188
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,400
Gintoki, will you take up your sword alongside me in order to rebuild this corrupt country?

189
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,520
Once again will you lend me the strength that made you feared as the White Knight?

190
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,320
This is the end of the line.

191
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:36,090
Rather than be caught by the enemy, let us finish as warriors and slash our bellies.

192
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,490
Don't be stupid.

193
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,070
Stand up.

194
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,930
If you've got enough time to fantasize about your beautiful death,

195
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,780
why don't you live your life beautifully to the end?

196
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,710
Let's do this, Zura.

197
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,210
It's not Zura. It's Katsura!

198
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,770
His white hair was soaked in blood.

199
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,410
Bounding into battle was a vision of a demon knight in full glory.

200
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,020
It was he who fought like an avenging angel in the war with Amanto...

201
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,380
He was like a god of war who was feared not only by his enemies but by his own people.

202
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,730
Gintoki Sakata, you should join with us, once again, to fight against the Amanto.

203
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,690
Gin...you were involved in the Foreigner Expulsion War too?

204
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,080
He disappeared after the battle.

205
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,190
I never really knew what was going on in your head.

206
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,860
I like a nice loud fight, but I hate morbid crap like terrorism.

207
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,290
The battle is over.

208
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,870
How long are you going to go on and on?

209
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,430
What are you, my mother-in-law?

210
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,760
Are you stupid?!

211
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,880
Mothers always pester their sons.

212
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,780
Nobody likes you because your heart isn't big enough to embrace.

213
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,350
You little...

214
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,960
If I didn't have I naturally wavy hair I'd definitely be popular with girls. I think.

215
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,660
There you go again blaming everything on your naturally wavy hair.

216
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,950
Pathetic.

217
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,520
Who's pathetic?

218
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,730
People use their complexes as springboards to greatness.

219
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,930
What the hell are you talking about?!

220
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,630
Our fight is far from over.

221
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,670
Inside, you're still fighting, Gintoki.

222
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,170
You worry about this country and are angry at the government and the Amanto for taking the lives of

223
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,770
the people who fought with you.

224
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,190
Let's clear out the Amanto and rebuild this corrupt country.

225
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,720
It's the only way we can honor the memory of our dead.

226
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,890
Our next target is the spaceship terminal.

227
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,730
We shall destroy that accursed tower that brings the Amanto

228
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,430
and we shall purge them from Edo.

229
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,940
But the tower is a major world hub. It won't fall easily.

230
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,770
We need your strength, Gintoki.

231
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,180
Come on. I've been telling you that I...

232
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,940
You're already an accomplice for helping us. You can't refuse us.

233
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,260
If you don't want to be treated as a terrorist, then come with me.

234
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,450
There's no need to hesitate.

235
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,210
Your place was always with us.

236
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,870
Gin...

237
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,630
You're under arrest!

238
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,470
Come quietly, you terrorist scum!

239
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,000
I-It's the Shinsengumi!

240
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,790
Oh no! Run away!

241
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,010
Kill them all!

242
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,540
Wh-Wh-Who are those people?!

243
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,150
They're the Shinsengumi, the Armed Police.

244
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,250
An elite anti-terrorist squad they send in to wipe out rebel elements!

245
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,570
Those guys are really annoying.

246
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,890
What should we do, boss?

247
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm not your freakin' boss!

248
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,120
And you're the annoying one!

249
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,280
Zura, if you need a boss, I'm your man!

250
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,630
"Whether you're doing something good or bad, be the boss." That's my motto!

251
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,120
You shut up!

252
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,870
Your mottos sounds like something out of the mouth of a feudal warlord!

253
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,430
Hey.

254
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,400
There's no need to run. It's a nice fight.

255
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,540
Let's have some fun.

256
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,970
Hey, are you really a public official?

257
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,010
I'm surprised you passed the interview.

258
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,080
Your pupils are dilated.

259
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,350
You should talk, creep!

260
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,450
Coming from someone with eyes of a dead fish.

261
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,720
It's all right. They sparkle during my close-ups.

262
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,960
Don't lie!

263
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,670
You're pretty good.

264
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,760
Most people can't keep up with this transition.

265
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,560
That's dangerous. What would you do if it really hit me?

266
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,780
You idiot! I'm trying to hit you!

267
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,230
Mr. Hijikata, look out.

268
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,400
You alive, Mr. Hijikata?

269
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,150
Moron, you coulda killed me!

270
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,580
Aw. I missed.

271
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,910
What do you mean miss?! Hey! Look at me!

272
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,230
Where are they?

273
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,780
Vice-chief, they're in here.

274
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,650
Hey, come on out!

275
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,670
Stop your useless resistance!

276
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,650
Did you grow more hair?

277
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,660
This is the fifteenth floor. There's no escape!

278
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,490
What are you doing?

279
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,260
It's a time bomb.

280
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,700
I was going to use it on the terminal, but I have no choice.

281
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,850
I'll give those guys a little present.

282
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,530
In the confusion, everyone run.

283
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,640
Jerk! What do you think you're doing to Katsura?!

284
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,330
Katsura, let's put an end to this.

285
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,420
No matter how much you get your hands dirty,

286
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,820
our dead buddies won't be pleased, nor will times change.

287
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,390
Don't dirty them anymore.

288
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,410
You're the one who's dirty, Gintoki.

289
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,710
As soon as times changed, you went over to the other side.

290
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,130
A warrior must stick to his beliefs.

291
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,550
What's the point in standing up for beliefs that have been laid out for me?

292
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,860
Looking forward to losing your precious friends?

293
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,980
I don't want that anymore.

294
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,930
If it's my life on the line, I'll adhere to my own code.

295
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,990
And I'll protect what I want to protect.

296
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,250
Gin...this thingy...I pushed the switch when I was fiddling with it.

297
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,050
What a nightmare.

298
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,000
How cliché.

299
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,080
Hey, come out. We're really going to fire this time.

300
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,140
Mr. Hijikata, our evening soap rerun is going to start soon.

301
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,880
Geez. I forgot to set my VCR.

302
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,340
Let's get this over with. Prepare to fire!

303
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,910
Fire!

304
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,960
Wh-What are you doing?! Stop them!

305
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,420
If you want to stop something, then stop this bomb, please!

306
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,990
You have a bomb squad, don't you?!

307
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,760
He's got a bomb!

308
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,710
Hold on! Hey, wait!

309
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,790
Shinpachi! Didn't you say that you were good with machines?!

310
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,450
Y-Y-You're mistaken! Kagura, this is your fault to begin with!

311
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,520
Do somethin'!

312
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,470
N-N-Naturally curly hair and bombs go well with each other!

313
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,250
A-A-An inari sushi came out from the side!

314
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,220
A-A-An ethical society.

315
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,970
I-I-Ingry Mongry?

316
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,420
R-R-Reach, first-turn win, self-draw...

317
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,450
M-M-Momiji manju!!

318
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,030
I-I-I don't want to have an affair!!

319
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,820
W-W-Welcome back, Yokoi!!

320
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,910

A-A-Adrian!!

322
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,470
Who is Adrian anyway?! The game ends if you end it with "N"!

323
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,320
Only 10 seconds left!

324
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,340
Gin! The window, the window!

325
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,840
Impossible! We're dead!

326
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,780
Gin, bite down on something.

327
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,090
Oh. Hey!

328
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,140
G-Gin!

329
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,190
Good-bye, Gin!

330
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,370
If you've got enough time to fantasize about your beautiful death,

331
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,330
why not just live beautifully to the end?

332
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,330
Live life beautifully?

333
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,510
What's so beautiful about that?

334
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:03,000
I guess having a friend who never changes isn't such a bad thing, after all.

335
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,770
Hurry, Sogo!

You're just like what you look like: a four-eyed geek.

350
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,100
You're a pretty typical character, aren't you?

351
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,440

Does anyone know the meaning of "Gin Tama"?

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,590
Here!

366
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,980
I can't see the black board because of Katsura's long hair.

367
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,790
Zura, I told you to go cut your hair or take it off.

368
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,420
Sensei, I can't take it off.

369
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,730
Then remove it.

370
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,200
Sensei, I'm so going to sue this school.

371
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,510
Let's get back to our lesson.

372
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,930
Sensei!

373
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,030
Kagura, the exchange student, is eating her bento lunch in class.

374
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,610
She's totally flashing her wiener, too.

375
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,720
Sensei, I'm not having early lunch.

376
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,220
In my country, I always had snacks like popcorn during class.

377
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,300
I see. Then go back to your country!

378
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,040
OK, so back to the lesson...

379

I don't think you're supposed to smoking during class.

381
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,680
This isn't a cigarette.

382
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,880
It's a lollypop.

383
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,350
Smoke doesn't come out from a lollypop.

384
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,810
That's because I'm licking it so fast.

385
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,470
What I just covered will be on the test.

386
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,030
So you better be taking notes.  Dismissed!
