"Land of the Samurai."

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,200
The days when our country was called that are long past...

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,940
Hey, what's with that?

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,770
Makes it seem like a rerun...

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,440
A viewer who just started watching said they didn't understand what was going on.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,830
They should buy the original comics or the DVD.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,550
That's right. It's a business opportunity.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,290
What's with that?!

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,380
Women and anime are more appealing if they're a bit mysterious.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,080
So, the people who don't understand should do something on their own.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,710
This anime's hopeless....

13
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:09,710
[Spring is the season of new beginnings. People marry, start new jobs...]

14
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,040
[To those people, we offer the following words: "Life is like a soap bubble."]

["Stress Makes You Bald, but It's Stressful to Avoid Stress, so You End Up Stressed Out Anyway, so in the End There's Nothing You Can Do"]

16
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,490
What is right?

17
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,520
What is wrong? In this mixed-up world...

18
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,270
deciding what is right and wrong is not easy.

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,600
You can't just go by somebody else's rules. If you let yourself be controlled like that...

20
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,210
you'll just become a puppet that can't make decisions on its own.

21
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,170
In the end, the only choice is to decide for yourself.

22
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,880
You have to live by your own rules.

23
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,660
It should be okay to put JUMP with the combustible trash. Reading it always lights my fire.

24
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,660
You're the only thing that's on fire!

25
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,270
I keep telling you that magazines go out with Wednesday's recyclable trash!

26
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,300
When are you ever going to learn how to separate your trash?

27
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,730
You throw everything in the combustible trash pile!

28
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,950
I hate non-combustible trash!

29
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,470
What's non-combustible, anyway? That makes it sound like this won't burn!

30
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,160
This can be burned! Those sanitation workers are just too lazy to do it.

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,330
You some kind of overzealous teacher or something?!

32
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,250
Anyway, take that back home with you.

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,270
Recently, there've been a lot of arsons at trash collection sites,

34
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,260
so they're much stricter with the rules.

35
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,340
What a pain.

36
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,290
Oh well, then. Maybe I'll just use it for toilet paper...

37
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,560
Huh? Hey, whoa! A fire? Here?

38
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,120
That hag! She tossed her cigarette!

39
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,720
This is bad! Water! Water! No water!

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,990
Pull yourself together, pal. You can do this... Believe in yourself... You can do it...

41
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,570
Caught you in the act at last!

42
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,450
Serial arsonist.

43
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,560
Now that I, Tatsumi of the ME team, have found you, don't expect to escape with your life!!

44
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,560
[Note: ME team is a play on ME-gumi no Tatsugoro of "Abarenbo Shogun."]

45
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,670
Excuse me, please stop staring.

46
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,810
[ME-Team HQ]

47
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,810
I'm trying to tell you.

48
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,540
I was just trying to put out the fire with my "holy water."

49
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,100
Stop lying, you perverted arsonist!

50
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,990
Showing me your filthy thing! You've traumatized me, you perv!

51
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,520
You know, this experience will only make you stronger.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,550
I don't want to hear that from the guy who traumatized me!

53
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,230
You mustn't be so passive about it!

54
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,530
When you saw my crotch, you became a live witness to a man in battle!

55
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,300
Think positive!

56
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,740
Damn you. Don't make fun of me just because I'm a woman!

57
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,400
From the day I became a firefighter,

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,710
I rolled up my gender in a wad of tissues and threw it in the trash, you jerk.

59
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,210
Then seeing a crotch or two shouldn't be a problem at all!

60
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,720
Just wrap it up in a tissue and throw it away! It was embarrassing for me, too, you know.

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,500
[Note: The scroll reads: "Don't play with fire"]

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,500
This isn't about you! This is about arson!

63
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,480
Like I told you, I didn't do it! This was the only liquid I had!

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,230
Get away from there, dammit!

65
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,910
What's going on? You sure are noisy.

66
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,440
I was resting up so I'd be ready in case of an emergency. Keep quiet, stupid!

67
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,420
Everyone! I captured the arsonist!

68
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,440
Probably the wrong one again, right?

69
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,410
You've hauled in eight innocent people this week alone.

70
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Enough of this "Nancy Drew" crap.

71
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,020
Don't you ever do anything foolish like trying to catch the arsonist again, idiot.

72
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,300
A firefighter's job is to also prevent fires!

73
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,740
I'm positive he's the one! He was setting fires at a trash pickup site just like the arsonist.

74
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,590
Fire at the tofu shop at 3-chome.

75
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,170
Origin appears to be a trash pickup area next to the store.

76
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,870
Proceed immediately. Repeat. Fire at the tofu shop at 3-chome...

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,840
Okay! Guys, let's roll!

78
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,940
Right!

79
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,870
That can't be...

80
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,910
I told you. I told you.

81
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,540
Tatsumi...

82
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,030
I realize you're a woman trying as hard as you can to keep up with the guys.

83
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,550
But you're chasing your own tail!

84
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,370
By the time you realize you've been blown around by the winds of life, it'll be too late.

85
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,790
So don't try to live the same life we lead.

86
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,320
Telling me that won't change my mind!

87
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,500
Then let me convince you. A woman can't be a firefighter.

88
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,900
Wha...?

89
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,460
I called your home. Your family should be coming to get you soon.

90
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,860
Huh? That wasn't necessary!

91
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,320
Sorry.

92
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,840
My mistake got you into this mess.

93
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,040
Don't worry about it. I showed you something embarrassing, so let's call it even.

94
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,930
Damn you! Since we met, all you've talked about is your crotch!

95
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,360
Man, you are a weird guy.

96
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,420
Hey, where're you going?

97
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,340
To catch the arsonist, of course.

98
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,990
I'm not the type to give up just because something like this happened.

99
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,750
You don't give up.

100
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,660
Don't blame me when you vanish like a soap bubble being blown around by the wind.

101
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,180
Shut up! Someday I'll be the greatest firefighter in Edo.

102
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,950
I won't let those clowns or an arsonist defeat me!

103
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,360
You good-for-nothing son!

104
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Where did you learn to play with fire?! That's not how we brought you up!!

105
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,610
Come on, stop that, Kagura-chan! What're you doing? He'll die! You're killing him!

106
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,610
Hey! Men are soap bubbles!

107
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,460
I'm disgusted with you! You're just like your father, aren't you?!

108
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,200
Hey!

109
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,580
Hey!

110
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,310
Kagura-chan, where'd you come up with those lines?

111
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,400
"The city that never sleeps: Edo Hacchobori: 24 hours."

112
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,580
It's a quote from "Battle of the Pickpocket vs. The G-men."

113
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,380
Spare me the quote! You learn nothing but the strangest things!

114
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,110
You can forget about growing up into a decent adult!

115
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,070
Yo-chan! Check out the weirdo!

116
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,590
What're you doing messing around back here?

117
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,830
Be good little boys and go away for a while. I'm busy right now, you know...

118
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,260
Sitting inside a trashcan? What are you, an idiot?!

119
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,770
Cut it out, you brats!

120
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,640
You want to go back inside your mother's womb?! You want to soak in amniotic fluid again?!

121
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,840
You can stay in there till ya rot! Idiot!

122
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,320
Idiot!

123
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,900
I'll remember this! I swear I'll shave off all your hair! Idiots!

124
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,290
Dammit. Those brats....

125
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,900
The arsonist's fires have all been set at trash pickup sites in Kabukicho.

126
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,800
Instead of running about aimlessly,

127
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,540
I'd have better luck catching the culprit by waiting patiently in one location.

128
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,280
Don't blame me when you vanish like a soap bubble being blown around by the wind.

129
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,670
Damn... I'm not getting blown around... because I want to.

130
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,410
Poor kid... Lost both parents, I hear.

131
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,830
I wonder how she's going to make it at her age.

132
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,380
If you're so worried, why don't you take her in?

133
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,330
Don't be silly. We haven't got the money to afford that.

134
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,450
Hey...

135
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,230
You there, we went through the trouble to save your life.

136
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,240
At least look happy, you dummy.

137
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,520
If you can't do that, then at least lash out at me.

138
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,400
Lash out and say, "It's your fault my mom and dad are dead!"

139
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,810
Bastard.

140
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,790
Why'd you have to save me?

141
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,270
You should've let me die with my parents.

142
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,550
Fool!

143
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Don't you ever say that again.

144
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,050
What? You're going to take in that brat?

145
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,000
What're you thinking, Chief?!

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,550
You gonna take in every child who's orphaned by fire, now?!

147
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,650
There'll be no end to it!

148
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,060
Shut up! Leave me alone, idiot!

149
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,040
Don't tell me that!

150
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,670
Brat. From this day on, the ME team is your home.

151
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:31,330
We firefighters are like a big family, so adding one little brat isn't a big deal.

152
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:38,820
But remember, even if one brat disappears, there's someone here who'll be sad about it.

153
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,180
Dang! I fell asleep!

154
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,440
All quiet on the western front.

155
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,970
Yo... Sweet dreams, Sis?

156
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,490
You...Why?!

157
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,780
Ow ow ow ow...

158
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,380
The arsonist has caused me trouble, too.

159
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,250
I can't clear out my JUMP, you see.

160
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,450
And besides...

161
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,930
I wanted to see how high a soap bubble riding on the wind could fly.

162
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,030
You mean...

163
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,970
No question about it. That's the arsonist...

164
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,300
What makes you say that?

165
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,190
A guy who lives an honest life wouldn't be sneaking around like that.

166
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,540
You're sneaking around!

167
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,520
It's not enough that he's sneaking around; he's got shifty eyes, too!

168
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,770
Scary! I'm scared!

169
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,910
Shut up!

170
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,050
Huh? Wait a minute...

171
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,050
I know that emblem...!

172
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,430
Hey, isn't that the bald guy from your place?

173
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,080
Chief... What's he doing here?

174
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,330
Enough of this "Nancy Drew" crap.

175
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,650
Don't you ever do anything foolish like trying to catch the arsonist, idiot.

176
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,150
It can't be...!

177
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,900
Chief wouldn't...!

178
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,040
Maybe I shouldn't throw them away, after all. I do like this one a lot.

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,750
Looks like he came to throw away his porno mags.

180
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,360
Ack...! Tatsumi!

181
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,980
What the hell are you doing here?!

182
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,870
What about you? You came all this way to throw away your filthy magazines?!

183
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,120
You've got it all wrong! I came to throw away my JUMP!

184
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,680
Don't lie to me! That's a lame excuse!

185
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,710
Tell me about it. I hope I don't turn out like this creepy old guy.

186
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,980
Hey! You're already on your way. You're already soaked hip-deep.

187
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,380
I've got a lot of adolescent kids at home, so I can't bring these back with me.

188
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,330
Idiot! Teenagers need this stuff more than anyone!

189
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,950
Society doesn't need people like you jerks!!

190
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,850
More importantly, what are you doing here?

191
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,460
Not poking your nose where it doesn't belong again...

192
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,960
I'm not gonna quit... No matter what some porno reading geezer tells me!

193
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,470
Quit, dammit! Don't you realize nobody wants a little girl like you involved in this?

194
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,510
Stop calling me a little girl.

195
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,980
I grew up watching you firefighters. I can help.

196
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,720
Whatever it was you grew up watching, I don't recall raising you to be a firefighter.

197
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,060
Fire can turn even the most precious things into ashes in an instant.

198
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,500
You know better than anyone...

199
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,090
how frightening it is...

200
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,990
Firefighters don't just battle the flames.

201
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,790
The weight of all those burned up ashes pile up inside them.

202
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,690
All the fellow firefighters who've died; the people they couldn't save.

203
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,130
I'm filled with ashes.

204
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,620
Do you think you can carry a load like that on your frail shoulders?!

205
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,830
You're not still upset about my father and mother dying, are you?

206
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:23,170
It's like I killed your father and mother, myself. If you got killed because of me, I...

207
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,620
What're you talking about, baldy?!

208
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,850
Dad and Mom died because of the fire! It's not your fault!

209
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,110
And more importantly, you saved my life!

210
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,260
You raised me into what I am!

211
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,500
What's wrong with paying back my debt of gratitude?!

212
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,020
What's wrong with wanting to help?!

213
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,500
I didn't raise you out of love or anything like that.

214
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,630
I was paying back my debt. For my crime of leaving your parents to die!

215
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,060
There's no reason to become a firefighter anymore, right?

216
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,220
Now, go find yourself a boyfriend somewhere and live like a normal girl.

217
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,230
You there...

218
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,520
Today is combustible trash day. Why are porno books being thrown out?

219
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,820
It's obvious. Because after you read them, you get "hot."

220
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,830
Huh?

221
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,620
You have a good understanding...

222
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,810
They talk about segregating the trash...

223
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,250
But all trash burns once you set fire to it.

224
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,780
Who needs stupid rules.

225
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,140
We should just burn all trash.

226
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,280
Hey wait, you!

227
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,350
He must be the arsonist.

228
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,980
Out of my way!

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,270
Stop!

230
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,280
Yikes! The fire is spreading!

231
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,730
Somebody! Fire!

232
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,270
Run! Fire!

233
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,070
Old man, can you hear me?! There's a fire!

234
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,910
Huh? Throw the castella cake hard against the wall? Okay, gotcha.

235
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,080
You don't understand at all! Are you wearing ear plugs?

236
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,820
That's right.

237
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,980
If I had to say which, I prefer a love where I do the chasing rather than being chased.

238
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,920
[Note: Refers to "Oikaketai no!" Fuji-TV show of the late 1980s.]

239
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,920
I want to chase! Say, that starred Yoko Minamino, didn't it?

240
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,630
I don't know what you're talking about!

241
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,010
Your house is on fire! Can't you see the smoke?!

242
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,600
Hurry and run away, you stupid old fart!!

243
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,830
Who're you calling an old fart?! You wanna die?!

244
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,890
Why can you only hear the bad things?!

245
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,500
Oh no! It ignited the gas pipe.

246
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,570
This is getting me nowhere.

247
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
Wait, Tatsumi!

248
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,480
I'll drag the old guy out. You call the ME team!!

249
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,350
Shut up! You don't give me orders! Go spread your baldness elsewhere!

250
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,320
No way! Even if I were bald, my hair wouldn't scatter!

251
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,250
It's a very neat bald!

252
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,630
This is dangerous. The fire's raging out of control!

253
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,290
What's wrong with this...?

254
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,940
Old man! What're you waiting for?! I said the place is on fire!

255
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,940
I'm not going to an old folks home!

256
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,470
I'm going to be a burden to you until the day I die! Serves you right!

257
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,790
What're you, high?!

258
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,920
Dammit! It's like preaching to a horse!

259
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,170
Who're you calling a deer?!

260
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:23,130
[Note: A play on "baka", the Japanese word for fool. The direct interpretation of the kanji for baka is someone who can't tell a horse from a deer.]

261
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,350
You're no deer! You're a fool!

262
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,130
You fool! You're still...?

263
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,720
Don't let the fire spread any further!

264
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,150
Quick! Bring the water!

265
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,120
Hurry!

266
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,480
Hey! Where'd the Chief go?

267
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,220
Damn! It won't budge! Why did you protect me? You should've left me!

268
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,720
Never mind me. Grab the old man and evacuate. Tatsumi...

269
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,220
Don't give me that crap!

270
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,910
Tatsumi, if you call yourself a firefighter, you know what your priority is, don't you?

271
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,200
If you hesitate, you won't be able to save those who need to be saved.

272
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,570
Firefighters are...

273
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,080
You don't understand that!

274
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,110
Shut up! It's true that I tried becoming a firefighter because I lived with you.

275
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,510
I wanted to repay my debt of gratitude. But, that's not all...

276
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,200
Just like how you rescued me that day...

277
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,050
I want to rescue someone!

278
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,230
That's why regardless of what you say, I'll do whatever I want.

279
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:54,090
You're a stupid...woman... I want you... I want you to live...

280
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:01,810
That's right. As I told you, I took you in at first because I wanted to repay my debt.

281
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,180
But somewhere along the way...

282
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,390
It wasn't about making amends anymore. I just enjoyed watching you grow up.

283
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,310
After seeing people die before my eyes so many times,

284
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,600
I had become an unstable soap bubble.

285
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,670
I felt as though I would be blown away by the wind and burst at any moment.

286
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:27,360
But, because you were here, I managed to stay afloat instead of bursting.

287
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,750
Because you smiled, I was able to rush to the fires...

288
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,100
Before you came along, I carried only ashes.

289
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,770
But you taught me what it means to carry the responsibility of a family.

290
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,250
I can't allow you to get burdened with our way of life! That's why...

291
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,520
You have to get away, Tatsumi! I don't want to carry my daughter's ashes too!

292
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,930
You're such a stupid old man...

293
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,020
What?

294
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,200
I don't want to carry my parent's ashes either! Stupid.

295
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,040
So wait here...

296
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,830
I'll be right back, Dad...

297
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,950
Life is like a soap bubble...

298
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,190
Riding on the wind, tossed back and forth...

299
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,350
Before you realize it, it's gone...

300
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,500
In the instant it's about to disappear, you think it could fly higher into the sky,

301
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,470
but by that time, it's always too late.

302
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,850
Forgive me, Tatsumi... But don't you think someone like me flew high enough?

303
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,550
Wait! Who're you?!

304
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,770
What're you doing? It's too dangerous! Too dangerous!

305
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,440
Yo. Glad you're okay.

306
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,970
You haven't burst yet, soap bubble.

307
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,150
Well, at your age, you probably can't fly very far anyway, but...

308
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,930
She can fly! If you keep blowing behind her...

309
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,190
Actually, you know that better than anyone, don't you?

310
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,330
You've watched her longer than anyone...

311
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,140
The only thing I can do for you is...

312
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,720
Who're you?

313
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,230
This is me, too...

314
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,620
A soap bubble that wants to fly higher than anyone.

315
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,940
Gin-san!

316
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,960
Clean this place up! It looks like we're living in a dumpster!

317
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,530
[Note: This is a reference to the Japanese TV drama, "Injured Angel."]

318
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,050
Yeah, since I can't figure out how to separate the trash,

319
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,530
I've decided to live carelessly, like a fallen angel.

320
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,130
What part of you is a fallen angel?!

321
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,320
Look at this stack of newspapers!

322
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,200
Good grief!

323
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,290
Hey, don't touch my stuff. Leave it there.

324
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,870
Are you hiding porno or something?

325
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,800
Shinpachi, leave him alone. Gin-chan's going through an awkward stage.

326
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Men are like soap bubbles.

327
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,720
["The Town Beauty Fireman!
Tatsumi of ME Team."]

328
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,770
I don't want to hear that from you!

329
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:27,080
[Preview]

330
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,390
Mother? Of whom?

331
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,870
Why're you acting like our mother?

332
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,530
You're bothering me with your "Chew your food 20 times before swallowing"!

333
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,310
The next episode... "Mothers Everywhere Are All the Same."

334
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,820
[A mother suddenly shows up at the Odd Jobs. She's searching for her lost son.]

335
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:40,020
[She hires them and the investigation begins! It's been a long time since they've done any real work.]
