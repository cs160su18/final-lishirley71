Our boats headed to Ryugu
Palace were destroyed

309
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,010
and we ended up on this deserted island.

310
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,760
It's Tianzhu, not Ryugu.

311
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,810
You be quiet.

312
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,700
It's great that everyone's all right.

313
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,140
What's so great about this?

314
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,240
We don't have a boat to escape
in or any way to call for help,

315
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,540
not to mention food and shelter.
What are we going to do?

316
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,880
With this many of us, we'll manage
on this deserted island.

317
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,250
For now, we need to think of a way

318
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,840
to get off this island and
how to survive until then.

319
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,180
Before we do, you should probably
choose me as your leader.

320
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,720
Why are you already the leader?

321
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,570
First, we should choose a leader to
decide how we'll choose a leader.

322
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,010
Then first, we should choose a leader

323
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,010
who will choose the leader who will
decide how we'll choose a leader.

324
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,030
Hey, this is really tedious!! Our world
will become filled with leaders!!

325
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,590
This is a bother, so Hasegawa-san
is good enough, right?

326
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,650
He's the oldest.

327
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,750
We should let him do what he
wants on this deserted island.

328
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,100
Don't say that in such an annoying
way! I don't want to be the leader!!

329
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,060
That's right. Madao is best left in charge
of opening and closing curtains.

330
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,220
Why am I in charge of something
that doesn't even matter?!

331
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,050
There aren't even any
curtains anywhere!!

332
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,650
You're in charge of closing
the curtains on your life.

333
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,210
Are you telling me to die?!
This girl is telling me to die!!

334
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,160
What we need right now is
food and a place to sleep.

335
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,640
Also, we can't do anything unless
we explore this island.

336
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,380
For today we shall split into four groups:
the food team, the shelter team,

337
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,210
the exploration team, and
the curtains team...

338
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,780
We don't need anyone
in charge of curtains!!

339
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,170
I want to be on the food team.
I'll cook with the utmost care.

340
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,500
All right, make one more team-the
chemical poisoning team.

341
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,720
Poison!

342
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,110
Look. I caught these.

343
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,950
Oh my! That's amazing, Hasegawa-san!!

344
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,930
I may not look it, but
I'm a man of the sea.

345
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,450
As long as I have a pole
and bait, this is nothing.

346
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,780
That's amazing!

347
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,810
God gives merits to even the
most worthless of people.

348
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,770
So you were praising God...

349
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,110
But even if we have ingredients,
we can't cook...

350
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,970
We can't start a fire. I've tried everything.

351
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,900
Tried everything? Looks more
like you were fooling around.

352
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,970
You were playing go.

353
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,970
When my father was still alive,

354
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,270
we'd gather around the othello
or go board and start a fire.

355
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,110
You can't start a fire that way!!

356
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,080
Oh yeah, you were smoking, weren't
you? Do you have a lighter?

357
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,580
Sorry, I dropped it in the ocean.

358
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,060
I was desperate to save
these sunglasses.

359
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,340
I see. That's problematic.

360
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,950
I really want a cigarette.
Do something, Otae-chan.

361
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,300
Oh!! I know.

362
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,120
Hasegawa-san, could you
lend me your sunglasses?

363
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,200
What? What are you going to do?

364
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,770
I just got a great idea... Just watch.

365
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,830
Just to let you know,

366
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,780
it's probably impossible to start a fire
using those lenses and sunlight.

367
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,800
You were going to break them?!

368
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,490
Furthermore, you've got matches!!

369
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,590
We were supposed to have a wonderful
summer vacation at Ryugu Palace.

370
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,710
Why did this have to happen to us?

371
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,000
Things like this are nice once
in a while. It's like camping.

372
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,920
Camping? We might not
be able to get home.

373
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,870
Just as I expected of our leader.

374
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,400
She isn't upset by any predicament,

375
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,330
and, if anything, she's got
the guts to enjoy it.

376
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,130
You're a true samurai!!

377
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,180
I'm not a samurai. Don't touch me!

378
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,600
Gintoki, why don't you learn
a little from our leader?

379
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,770
You always complain about silly things.

380
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,180
If you're really disappointed
with the status quo,

381
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,000
you should join the Anti-Foreigner
Faction! Honestly...

382
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,220
Why are you suddenly trying
to get me to join you?

383
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,170
Why are you talking to me
as if you're my mother?

384
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,230
Hey, what's that?

385
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,370
It's a giant box.

386
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,480
It looks manmade. Why is
this on a deserted island?

387
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,830
Leader, don't touch it!!

388
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,170
Courage and recklessness are
two different things, leader.

389
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,840
If you're a samurai, don't
charge in blindly.

390
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,300
You need to have the strength
to stand up to your enemies

391
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,650
with the knowledge of how
terrifying they are!!

392
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,340
You already touched it!!

393
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,650
Run away...

394
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,120
Kagura!!

395
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,250
Gin-chan!! Zura!!

396
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,630
I'm not "Zura." I'm "Katsura"!!

397
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,370
What is this smoke?!

398
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,860
Hey, are you all right?

399
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,210
I'm not "All right." I'm "Katsura"!!

400
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,620
Gin-chan!! Zura!!

401
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,410
Are you all right?

402
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,480
Who are you?!

403
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,100

Because of the smoke from a treasure chest (?).]
