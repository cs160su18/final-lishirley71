Hey, he's a friend of mine.

Let him go.

172

W-Wait.  Help me.

173
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,570
Oh yeah, Master, this delivery date of yours looks like fun, but be careful, okay?

174
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,720
Lately, there's been some terrorist activity by the exclusionist rebels.

175
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,840
They have been using messengers to deliver their bombs.

176
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,670
They have this vicious scheme where they make

177
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,590
innocent messengers deliver bombs to embassies and such.

178
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,130
So be careful, okay?

See'ya.

180

Noriko, where does that last parcel go to?

181
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,240
The embassy.

182
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,690
Is it making weird noises?

183
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,160
It's ticking. Like a clock.

If we stop, I'll die!

187
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,540
We're gonna die anyway!

188
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,200
It's a bomb.

189

That's a bomb!

We'll just stop for a bit.

192
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,800
When I get off the scooter, start running, okay?

193
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,940
I'm telling you, if we stop, I'll die.

194
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,090
Who cares about that anymore?

195
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,290
I don't wanna die any more than you!

196
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,740
So you're going to let me blow up alone?

197
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,330
I thought we were partners!

198

Didn't you promise me we'd become the wind together?

199

I hear when people die they become the wind anyways.

201

So let's pull over!

202
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,250
No!

203
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,580
I don't want it to be an explosive blast.

I can't hear you so I'm gonna keep talking.

That old geezer... If he had the time to install this, then he should've fixed the damn brakes!

217
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,000
I forgot to warn you about something.

218
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,490
I should've fixed the brakes instead of installing that radio.

219
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:13,990
That's all.

220

It's just a confession!

Don't use the radio for stupid stuff like that!

222

Knowing you, I'm sure the brakes are already gone.

223
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,250
When that happens, you see a red button on the bottom?

224
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,910
That's an emergency mechanism activation switch.

225

If you push it...

226

The rocket booster will kick in and give you a dramatic burst of speed.

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,160
Gin-san is going to be okay, right?

327
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,700
You'll fix it, right?

328
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,440
His hair!

329
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,470
So all you care about is the hair?!

330
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,370
This condition is called "Comedic Post-Explosion Hair".

331
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,910
After two or three scenes, it should return to normal like nothing ever happened, so don't worry.

332
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,000
No!  I want you to fix it in this scene.

333
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,640
Who cares about that?

334
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,050
Get back to work, newbie!

335
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,490
Your patient's over here!

336
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,600
Okay, time for your medication.

337
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,450
Come on, Sarutobi-san, rub the medicine on him.

338
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,450
Oh, thank you.

339
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,850
It's been killing me since yesterday and I can't stand it...

340
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,560
My hemorrhoids.

341
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,900
"Killer" mode, on!

342
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,430
So what are you doing here?

343
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,990
What's going on?

344
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,040
You want to know about me, little boy?

345
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,790
Then you can't rush it.

346
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,630
If you want to get to know a woman, take your time.

347
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,990
Gently, one layer at a time...

348
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,240
Oh, never mind then.

349
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,650
Well, I wasn't quite finished yet.

350
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,880
Don't bother. It's too much trouble

351
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,320
What am I doing?

352
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,790
I said the important thing is knowing when to turn it on and off,

353
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,570
but when Gin-san's in front of me, I just go on auto-pig.

354
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,580
I must quickly switch over to "Killer" mode.

355
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,150
Now that I think about it, what's so great about this guy anyway?

356
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,240
I like sadistic men who'll brutally ravish me.

357
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,960
Who wants a sissy Gin-san that's so...

358
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,310
Weak...

359
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,820
Come to think of it,

360
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,160
Waki-san told me that men can't resist girls who are nice to them when they're down.

361
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,740
[Note: Touch is a manga by Mitsuru Adachi. Minami was one of the main female characters]

362
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,740
She also told me they have a weakness for Minami-chan from Touch.

363
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,710
"Lovestruck Pig" mode, on!

364
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,720
Oh come on, Gi-chan. You're always so grumpy.

365
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,700
If you keep acting like that, I might leave you for another man, okay?

366
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,030
Go wherever you want.

367
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,430
And while you're out, go buy me JUMP from the store downstairs.

368
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,040
I might go to Moscow, okay?

369
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,900
I may be Minami-chan, but I may even go north, okay?

370
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,800
[Note: In Japanese, Minami also means south.]

371
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,800
I don't think they sell JUMP in Moscow.

372
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,780
Actually, I figured hospital food doesn't taste very good...

373
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,560
Minami... I mean, Sachan brought you some homemade food.

374
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,980
You want some?

375
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,360
Oh, what should I do? Should I give you some?

376
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm not sure why, but I feel like punching her lights out.

377
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,580
Ta-da!

378
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,850
[Note: Oden is a Japanese Winter dish made from boiled eggs, daikon, konjac gel, fish cakes and other ingredients stewed in a pot.]

379
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,910
Can you believe, it's oden!

380
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,240
Ah, hot, hot!

381
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,850
Why would you bring a pot of boiling hot oden to someone who can't move?

382
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,630
And is that deep-fried tofu?

383
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,110
I thought you would be starved for some home cooking, okay?

384
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,500
Do you have to keep saying "Okay"?

385
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,680
Don't tell the other patients, okay?

386
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,950
Oh man, I saw everything.

387
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,460
Maybe I'll tell the head nurse?

388
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,840
Okay, Gi-chan, lie down for a second now, okay?

389
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm going to change your bandages, okay?

390
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
It's okay.

391
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,340
I just had them changed.

392
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,100
Oh, come on. Don't be shy, okay?

393
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,530
I told you, it's okay.

394
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,170
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

395
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,350
Oh stop, Gi-chan. Don't move, okay?

396
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,770
See? You moved...

397
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,370
...so look what happened, okay?

398
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,990
How exactly could I be responsible for that?

399
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,630
You tied that bondage harness yourself? Amazing, isn't it?

400
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,040
I like that part of you that refuses to be tied down, okay?

401
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,360
But I am worried about your injuries...

402
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

403
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,180
...so I should tie you up, okay?

404
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,360
What the hell are you doing?

405
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,140
Head Nurse!  Help me!

406
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,430
Hang on.

407
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,440
I'll call the head nurse right now...

408
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,810
I'm going to go to the gift shop now.

409
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,920
What was it, now?

410
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,280
You wanted me to buy Sunday, right?

411
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,520
I'll be right back, okay?

412
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,760
Have you ever heard of the movie, "Misery?"

413
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,610
The injured author who can't move

414
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,870
gets crippled by the psychotic caretaker who is supposedly there to take care of him.

415
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,620
Man, that was really scary.

416
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,710
That lady actress was so believable.

417
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,630
W-Wait a sec!

418
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,230
Pull the candle out!

419
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,370
You pull it out.

420
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,150
Why should I do it?

421
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,810
I can't do it.

422
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,250
It's so painful. If I do it, I'm afraid something important will come out with it!

423
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,010
You keeping your hopes and dreams in there?

424
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,170
Gin-chan!

425
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,760
How are you doing?

426
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,250
We've come to cheer you up!!

427
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,270
Gin-chan, you idiot!

428
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,760
Oh man, our bad.

429
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,020
I'll explain that kind of thing to Kagura-chan.

430
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,250
No, wait! It's not what you think!

431
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,500
I'm not into stuff like that!!

432
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,650
What "things"?!

433
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,590
What am I gonna do now?

434
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,110
Even if I explain it when I get home, it's still gonna be really awkward.

435
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,180
Sorry about that.

436
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,730
I'll go with you and explain.

437
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,010
Forget it! That'll be even more suspicious!

438
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,800
Just don't ever stand in the same scene as me again!

439
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,260
Well, whatever the case may be, right now...

440
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,230
We'd better get the hell outta here.

441
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,040
Well, well, if it isn't Sakata-san and Hattori-san.

442
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,650
Patients aren't allowed to crawl about unsupervised.

443
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,890
This is so much more fun than my real job.

444
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,890
Women should live for love and not for work.

445
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,410
Maybe I'll retire from this gory assassin job and really become a nurse.

446
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,330
I'll just be Gin-san's exclusive personal nurse.

447
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,350
Did you hear?

448
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,620
About Dr. Kuroda?

449
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,800
Is it really true?

450
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,510
I heard he's involved in organ trade.

451
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,410
Yeah, and you know those noisy patients in the hospital right now?

452
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,380
Oh yeah, you mean Sakata-san and Hattori-san.

453
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,050
Well apparently, they're his next targets.

454
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,500
That's not so bad. It'll sure be a lot quieter around here.

455
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,150
Oh my God! Gin-san!

456
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,950
Hey, you!

457
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,280
It's all my fault!

458
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,950
It's because I was slacking on the job!

459
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,160
Be careful your passions don't get the better of you.

460
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,960
It could trip you up. Be careful, okay?

461
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,490
What am I doing?

462
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,200
All this foolish talk about love and being in love...

463
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,520
We've done a complete medical workup on both of you

464
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,450
and found severe internal problems.

465
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:18,210
Sakata-san, you're at high risk for diabetes yet you continue to eat sweets.

466
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,520
Oh yeah, I've gotten to the point where

467
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,210
I've decided that I'll live a thick, rich, creamy life, however short.

468
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,540
Take a look at this.

469
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,190
Never mind already. It's not gonna scare me.

470
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,820
I'm used to hearing stuff like that. You can't scare me one bit.

471
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,720
If this keeps up, the sugar and urine in your body will become a deadly mix

472
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,560
and your testicles will explode.

473
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
No way!

474
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,370
There's...nothing I can do to protect him?

475
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,000
Don't tell me I can't even protect the one I care about the most.

476
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
And as for you, Hattori-san.

477
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,380
It seems you came here to treat your hemorrhoids.

478
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,840
Yes, as embarrassing as it is, I'll do my best.

479
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,370
Well, about that...

480
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,480
At the rate you're going...

481
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,280
Something...will explode.

482
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,710
That's kinda random, isn't it?

483
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,750
I don't care about Zenzo.

484
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,460
God, I really am a totally useless...

485
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,290
...lovestruck pig.

486
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,560
Just a plain ol' lovestruck pig.

487
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,230
That's not true...

488
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,990
I'm not a lovestruck pig...

489
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,570
I'm not...a lovestruck pig...

490
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,690
I'm...

491
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,360
I'M!

492
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,600
Killer mode, ON!

493
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,210
What fools.

494
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,090
To believe a load of crap like that...

495
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,480
What imbeciles!

496
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,720
At this rate, your brains are totally useless.

497
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,830
But the other organs are exceptional.

498
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,830
It'll be better for the world if we give them to people who can put them to good use.

499
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,440
Let's begin.

500
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,690
Is everything ready?

501
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,440
Yes.

502
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,410
Scalpel.

503
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,080
Yes.

504
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,790
Wh...What do you think you're doing?

505
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,790
Doctor!!

506
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,580
You!!  What the hell are you doing?

507
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm sorry.  I dropped my glasses.

508
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,480
So I tend to confuse the words "Scalpel" and "Shank".

509
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,100
You bitch!

510
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,250
Who the hell are you?

511
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,650
The bells of Gion Temple ring for you...

512
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,740
[Note: A famous opening passage from the historical novel, "Tale of Heike".]

513
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,370
"All is vanity" toll the bells....

514
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,740
Wh-What the heck is this?

515
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,430
The brutal devil...

516
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,430
Bandages?

517
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,530
...delivers a righteous deathblow.

518
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,770
Take care.

519
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,770
Assassin Sachan...has arrived!!

520
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,310
Gin-san!! Gin-san...

521
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,360
Where are you?

522
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,310
Are you all right?

523
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,650
Gin-san!!

524
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,040
Thank goodness!

525
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,150
I can't see anything without my glasses, but you're okay, right?

526
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,310
I'm sorry...

527
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,170
It's all my fault...

528
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:52,130
I...was warned that love would interfere with my work.

529
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,010
But I still couldn't get you out of my mind, Gin-san.

530
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,240
But this is what I think...

531
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,340
An assassin who has someone she wants to protect

532
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,380
is more motivated than one who has no one.

533
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,780
That's why, I won't change my ways...

534
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,260
And I'll always...

535
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,250
...keep thinking of you, Gin-san...

536
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,330
Huh?

537
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,360
Killer mode, on!

538
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,040
The next episode, summer ghost stories...

539
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,350
"Like a Haunted House, Life is Filled with Horrors."

540
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:07,030
[This year's ghosts will be done by Odd Jobs. It will be thrilling in many ways.]

541
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,030
[This is Ochi-san, who will risk his life, at the summer festival's Haunted House.]
