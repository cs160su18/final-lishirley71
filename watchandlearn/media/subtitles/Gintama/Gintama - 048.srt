00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,070
[Today's opening is a short one! This episode has a lot going on.]

3
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,070
[Sorry, Yo-King-san. We couldn't do a second part next week.]

4
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,500
What? You mean even Matsumura, Degawa and the others were arrested?

5
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,120
Damned Shinsengumi.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,320
From what I've heard, even Katsura and Takasugi left Edo to escape their pursuit.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,190
Cowards, all of 'em.

8
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,690
Have they forgotten the Yamato spirit that drives us to save our country without the fear of death?

9
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,800
But... This may be a good opportunity.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,260
If we, The Three Parco Brothers, act now,

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,700
we could be the leaders of the Anti-Foreginer Faction before Katsura and Takasugi return.

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,440
They may be called the special police, but they're just a bunch of old country samurai.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,620
If we take out their leader, they'll become like sheep without a shepherd.

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,440
Our target is the Shinsengumi's brains, the demon vice-chief, Toshiro Hijikata.

15
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,460
["The More You're Alike, the More You Fight"]

16
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,190
Pops, the usual.

17
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,180
Okay.

18
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,010
Oh, this is the first time I've seen you without your uniform, Hijikata-san.

19
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,550
I'm off today.

20
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,140
When you're single, it's hard to find things to do.

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,850
Better than having a wife nag you all day.

22
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,830
Really?

23
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,000
Stop that, Dear.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,480
The demon vice-chief is totally off guard.

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,180
It'd be easy to get rid of him.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,690
Shall we do it?

27
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,030
Here you go! The Hijikata special!

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,100
What the heck is he eating?

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,590
Makes me sick just watching.

30
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,830
Here you are. Uji Gintoki Bowl!

31
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,810
What?! Red bean jam on rice?!

32
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,970
Huh?

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,680
What kind of diner is this?! Nothing but weirdos here!

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,380
Hey hey. Pardon me, but you with the mayonnaise dish-mind leaving?

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,650
Seeing you slop that into your mouth is gonna ruin my appetite. Right, buddy?

36
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,690
Me?

37
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,950
If that's the case, then I think it'd be best if you left.

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,220
Anyone with such a messed up sense of taste, who puts red bean jam on rice,

39
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,180
has no right to eat in a diner. Right, buddy?

40
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,550
Well, I...

41
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,870
Don't you know that since times long past, rice goes great with sweets?

42
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,110
Like an-pan and cakes. Right, buddy?

43
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,110
Huh? I don't know.

44
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,670
Don't you know that a sophisticated palate

45
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,480
requires contrasting flavors to bring out a dish's distinctions?

46
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,260
Adding salt or tartness brings out the original flavor.

47
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,220
In other words, a ton of mayo.

48
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,210
Right, buddy?

49
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,180
No...stop asking me. I'm not part of this.

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,760
Don't compare my red bean jam rice to your dog food.

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,460
This is a historic dish created by the Sandwich Shogun,

52
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,770
who was too lazy to eat dinner and dessert separately.

53
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,470
Right, buddy?

54
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,950
Who? Wouldn't Sandwich Shogun have invented sandwiches?

55
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,970
That's rice.

56
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,280
Oh Yeah? Well, mine was created by General Barbarosa who grew tired

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,980
of eating rice and mayonnaise separately and created...

58
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,570
Who the hell are these people?!

59
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,990
And mayonnaise isn't a necessary food to have with every meal.

60
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,900
All right then, shall we compare which tastes better:

61
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,330
Uji Gintoki Bowl or your dog food special?

62
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,240
Right, buddy?

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,450
What do you mean, "Right, buddy"?

64
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,270
Bring it on! Right, buddy?

65
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,800
Hold it! It's not all right! What is this?! Why should I have to eat it?!

66
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,030
We need an objective opinion. That's why it has to be done by a complete stranger.

67
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,320
Right, buddy?

68
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,900
We're counting on you. Right, buddy?

69
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,890
Right buddy?! You make it sound like its my name...

70
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,260
How is it, eh buddy? Isn't mine a lot tastier?

71
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,510
Huh? Right buddy?

72
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,030
Right buddy!

73
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,540
Thank you very much.

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,120
Tsk, we didn't anticipate such interference.

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,730
Big Brother, who was that silver-haired guy?

76
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,960
No idea.

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,160
That's all right, Jiro.

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,340
It's your turn. Don't blow it.

79
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,630
I feel awful.

80
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,360
Why'd I have to run into him of all people on my day off.

81
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,180
I was thinking of catching a movie, but...

82
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,340
It's for kids... I don't feel like watching it.

83
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,680
[Note: This movie is obviously a play on "My Neighbor Totoro"]

84
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,680
[My Neighbor Pedro]

85
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,680
Pedro, please help me!

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,640
My younger sister, Oshizu, is lost.

87
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,790
She's crying by herself somewhere.

88
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,500
Please, Pedro.

89
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,530
You try calling the cops?

90
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,160
Please, Pedro!

91
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,500
They cut my phone off.

92
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
Please, Pedro!

93
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,900
You're just like all the rest.

94
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,430
You only come asking, "Pedro, Pedro" when you need help.

95
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,200
The other day, you were playing Ping-Pong Dash. I know everything!

96
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,120
It's really getting to me...

97
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,400
This kids' movie speaks to adults, too. It's a movie all adults should see.

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,060
Is he seriously crying over this?

99
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,470
But this darkness will make the job easier.

100
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,210
Right from behind.

101
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,280
One stab.

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
Hey. You there!

103
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,070
Your sniveling is too loud.

104
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,440
I can't hear a thing.

105
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,170
What did Pedro just say?

106
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,400
What was it about Ping-Pong Dash?

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Sorry. Seems Pedro and that girl are about to...

108
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,400
You again! What's with you?!

109
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,920
Showing up everywhere I go!

110
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,560
That's my line, stupid!

111
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,200
What? You desperate for friends or something?!

112
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,680
You wanna be friends?

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,790
Idiot!

114
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,210
I wondered who the annoying guy munching on popcorn behind me was!

115
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,700
Get out! Get out right now!

116
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,760
Shut up!

117
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,930
I was just trying to get some popcorn out from between my teeth!

118
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,800
Now you've made me lose track of the whole story!

119
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,310
I may as well just finish my popcorn and leave!

120
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,320
That's what happens when a samurai eats such frivolous foods.

121
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,770
You an idiot or something?

122
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,370
Popcorn head! I hope your head pops!

123
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,940
I don't want to hear that from a mayo samurai!

124
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,340
How do you set that slicked-down hair of yours?!

125
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,610
With mayonnaise or something?!

126
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,850
Step outside! What offering do you want me to put by your gravestone?

127
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,670
Red beans? Popcorn?

128
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,380
What?!

129
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,850
Ow ow ow ow. That hurts!

130
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,100
Hey! Keep it down, you guys!

131
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,480
If you're gonna fight, take it outside.

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,820
You're bothering people!

133
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,800
What's the matter with you losers?

134
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,300
Watching this crappy movie in the middle of the day.

135
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,950
Go to work, lazy people.

136
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,850
That's what this guy in the sedge hat said.

137
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,340
Huh?!

138
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,070
"I'm pissed. Come up here and fight!" He said that too.

139
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,730
Wait! Why would I...?!

140
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,080
Fine! Let's do this!

141
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,270
Get him!

142
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,840
Ow ow ow! Just a minute!

143
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,700
Now's my chance. If I can use the confusion to...

144
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,820
...finish him...

145
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,860
[Note: Satou Youko, the Art Director of this Episode, is listed in the credits]

146
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,900
Everyone.

147
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,900
Let's just quietly watch the movie.

148
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,290
[THE END]

149
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,440
This movie makes me cry.

150
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,690
Damn Hijikata and that silver-haired guy.

151
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,360
I'll get them for sure next time.

152
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,420
I will avenge my younger brothers.

153
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,070
Why do I have to be so exhausted on my day off?

154
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,100
Everywhere I go, I run into that bastard.

155
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,620
I hate to admit it, but it seems we almost think alike.

156
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,170
I feel like taking a hot bath and a nap in a massage chair.

157
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,120
But I won't be tricked again.

158
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,470
The fact that I'm thinking this now means he's probably thinking the same thing.

159
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,110
So I should say the opposite and go where he doesn't want to go...

160
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,150
but he's probably thinking that too,

161
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,620
so I have to use reverse psychology and head straight for the Spa Land.

162
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,690
Huh? Did I just write a composition? He's thinking the same thing, so...

163
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,280
I'll do the opposite of the opposite!

164
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,960
Hijikata-kun, cut it out already.

165
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,670
I thought you'd show up again at the place I wanted to go,

166
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,600
so I thought of going where I didn't want to go,

167
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,240
but I didn't like the idea of going where I don't want to go because of you,

168
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,730
so I'll be true to myself and...

169
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,670
Then, I thought, "Was that just a composition?" And came here.

170
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,310
Dammit. Only the "composition" part matched.

171
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,000
I was a fool to try to read too deeply into your psyche.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Well, never mind.

173
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,210
It must be some kind of destiny that we keep meeting like this.

174
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,660
Now get outta here.

175
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,690
Why do I have to take directions from you?

176
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,390
If someone's leaving, it should be you.

177
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,230
Hey, are you a primary school kid or something?

178
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,410
If we keep meeting like this, we'll get into a fight,

179
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,970
so it'd be best if we didn't meet at all.

180
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,260
It's a very mature idea.

181
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,650
So you should be the one to leave.

182
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,820
Look, you, don't say that!

183
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,580
I was thinking of leaving,

184
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,650
but if I leave after you tell me to, then it's as though I followed your orders!

185
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,190
Now I can't leave!

186
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,120
Try to understand, brat!

187
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,910
Shut up! You're a brat!

188
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,290
Let me make this clear: I'm not leaving until you do.

189
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,710
Who're you kidding! I'm not leaving either.

190
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,390
Their stupidity is so alike.

191
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,100
You can both keep on arguing in here.

192
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,630
Never mind. Just get out.

193
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,000
You get out!

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Waste away.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,380
I'll just put this here.

197
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,240
Hey, enough already.

198

You're covered with sweat.

199
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,510

204
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,050
I'm fine, though.

205
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,920
No, I'm more okay than you.

206
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,020
No, my okay is better than your okay.

207

That's what you say, but I know you're struggling.

208

Now, you'll really go to Paradise.

We were surprised, but I think he was even more surprised.

[Old Bitch]

326
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,460
That spells "Old Bitch," you idiot!

327
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,850
Hey!

328
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,250
It's okay, let's play. Just kick the old hag. Er can!

329
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,640
How dare you! You old fart!

330
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,850
Hey, leave it alone!

331
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,890
You want me to kick it? I'll kick it for ya!

332
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,790
Bring that back within twenty seconds, and we'll play with you, old fart.

333
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,710
You're evil. Pure evil!

334
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,550
Catherine, don't abuse the elderly!

335
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,360
Shut up. I've got to eat. I need some protein.

336
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,840
Come on, let's go before the old hag changes her mind!

337
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,590
Catherine, get out of here and watch the shop.

338
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,140
If you're not nice to the elderly, don't expect the elderly to be nice to you.

339
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,570
What are you saying?

340
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,120
You're not a senior citizen, Otose-san.

341
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,320
You're still young and vibrant.

342
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,260
Okay, I got the can!

343
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,570
Let's start the game!

344
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,330
It's a pity we lost such a great man.

345
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,880
Even the most formidable warrior of the Oniwabanshu could not defeat old age.

346
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,270
What're you talking about?

347
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,640
He was nothing more than a good-for-nothing old perv who was out all year long.

348
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,070
You don't know how much trouble he caused me.

349
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,780
No, no. No mere pervert could be a teacher at Ninja School.

350
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,170
All the renowned ninja in Edo these days were brought up by your father.

351
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,760
You call him a good-for-nothing, but I loved that mischievous side of him.

352
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,360
Master!

353
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,640
Wh...huh? I got here as fast as I could when I heard he was in critical condition.

354
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,660
Dad already died. The critical night was two nights ago.

355
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,580
What? That can't be!

356
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,840
Master! Damn crucial night!

357
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,540
Hey, the guy being bent in half under your feet might be in a crisis too.

358
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,550
He's in a V-shape.

359
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,580
Oh...

360
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,570
Let's just quickly end this.

361
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,330
I just love this tension.

362
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,100
I feel like I'm a kid again.

363
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,670
Are y'all ready, boys and girls?!

364
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,530
Here comes the old man!

365
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,950
Where're you headed? The afterlife?

366
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,860
Man, why do we have to play with an old geezer we don't even know?

367
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,960
All I wanted was to eat yakiniku.

368
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm starving.

369
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,050
I'm sorry, old guy, but I'll just let myself get caught so we can end this game quickly.

370
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,380
How dare you say such a thing!

371
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,810
You're choosing to lose without even trying?

372
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,560
You call yourself a soldier?!

373
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,420
We call people like you losers!

374
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,690
Sergeant, please refer this loser to the military tribunal.

375
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,420
Don't bark so loud, Private Chihuahua.

376
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,040
If we have to play...we're not gonna lose.

377
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,650
Yakiniku tastes way better after a win than a defeat, Sergeant.

378
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,800
You said it, PFC Chihuahua.

379
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,200
Kick the can is but a child's game.

380
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,700
You win if you topple that can before you're spotted by "It".

381
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,710
You need a strategy to knock it over without being detected.

382
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,210
With that in mind...

383
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,030
Get ready to fire.

384
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,860
Aye aye, Sir!

385
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,840
Is that what you call kick the can, Sergeant?

386
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,730
It's kick the can in its purest form.

387
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,980
Remember your childhood days.

388
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,480
Remember when you were the kid who cried

389
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,590
because the hostages he caught were freed when the wind blew over the can.

390
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,200
If that can happen, then so can this.

391
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,960
You can't do that. That was just an act of nature!

392
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,150
You're too soft!

393
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,460
The whole joy of kick the can is to knock the can over by any means necessary

394
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,970
and then enjoy watching "It" cry in despair!

395
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,940
I don't know how many times the can got knocked over,

396
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,380
and how many times I cried as I pretended to count to 100 while everyone hid.

397
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,180
It's a game of triumph and tears...

398
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,160
That's kick the can!

399
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,590
Hey! This isn't kick the can, it's murder!

400
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,380
Pure murder!

401
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,030
Chihuahua! Who ordered you to hit the old man?

402
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,250
Sergeant! Begging the Sergeant's pardon, but that grenade was thrown by you!

403
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,330
This is a matter for the military tribunal!

404
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,660
This isn't fantasyland!!

405
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,940
You've killed him!!

406
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,500
Wait a minute!

407
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,760
Up we go.

408
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,410
He got up like nothing happened!

409
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,700
Tsk!

410
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,550
Die, old man!

411
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,290
You're not playing kick the can anymore!

412
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,910
He's guarding the can with his cane!

413
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,450
Tsk.

414
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,760
How is he moving like that?

415
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,450
I see you. There you are.

416
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,500
Yikes! A kunai!

417
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,700
Wh...Who is he?

418
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,620
What? Kick the can?

419
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,720
Oh, have you forgotten?

420
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
We played it a lot in Master's class.

421
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,950
Kick the can demanded the ability to hide yourself and make instantaneous decisions.

422
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,650
Making it exactly like an agent's work.

423
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,350
So as part of our ninja training, we played kick the can a lot, remember?

424
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,700
Oh that. We did.

425
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,260
Now that you mention it. It was fun.

426
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,940
If you can't remember, don't pretend like you do, okay?

427
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,760
And why'd you come to the funeral dressed like that?

428
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,760
I thought tonight was the crucial night and came straight over.

429
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,600
I looked at it like taking a drive, you know, because it was "over the hill."

430
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,160
It was the crucial night, but you came dressed like that?

431
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:01,010
Anyway, I can't forget the smile on Master's face as he played kick the can.

432
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,300
I think he had more fun than we did.

433
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,050
He really was like a big kid.

434
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,750
I'm sure that's why all the kids loved him.

435
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,760
What're you all of you talking about?

436
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,930
You're wasting your time!

437
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,400
Did you think you could beat me with your legs?

438
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,890
Found you, four-eyes!

439
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,570
You fell for my trap.

440
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,570
A classic error in kick the can... over-pursuing one target!

441
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,440
Dang...

442
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,050
That can is wide open!

443
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,150
Scraped my head! My head's been grated!!

444
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,150
Fools! Found you, too, Silver Hair!

445
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,290
Shinpachi!

446
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,820
Here!

447
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,020
Now, I step on the ca...

448
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,300
Over my dead body!

449
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,720
Found you, four-eyes and Silver Hair.

450
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,690
I stepped on the can.

451
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,780
Uh... My father loved playing kick the can.

452
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,780
When I was little we often played it together.

453
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,820
What a wonderful father he was to me.

454
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,310
But he didn't pay too much attention to me, and it got in the way of his work.

455
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,440
That was how I saw at it.

456
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,910
Even after I became an adult, he'd invite me to play.

457
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,770
I'd think, "What? That's odd? It was just Dad who wanted to play."

458
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,310
That's how it seemed.

459
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,710
Really, it's like he went straight from being a kid to being an old man.

460
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,670
He always seemed happy.

461
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,270
Which used to bother me when I was a teenager, but...

462
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,780
on the other hand, I envied him.

463
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,100
Kagura-chan, I see you.

464
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,450
It's rather simple for people to become adults,

465
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,920
but... it's not so easy to maintain a kid-like spirit

466
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,320
where you can enjoy everything.

467
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,190
And for that, yes, I must admire him.

468
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,420
There is just one thing, however, that I can never forgive...

469
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,510
That bastard sold all my JUMP to a used book store

470
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,930
and bought a shit-load of porno DVDs!

471
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,610
That makes me so angry!

472
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,940
Oh, forgive me for losing it.

473
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,050
But it makes me so angry, it brings tears to my eyes...

474
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,530
I've said many things, but in summary, he was a crappy father.

475
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:30,310
That's how he was, so he might come to your place and haunt you.

476
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,530
When he does,

477
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,630
please play kick the can with him.

478
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,560
Huh?

479
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,640
What is it?

480
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,040
I thought I just saw him smile a little.

481
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,280
What're you talking about? He's always had a smile.

482
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,820
