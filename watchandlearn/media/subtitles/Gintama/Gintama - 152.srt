00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,370
The land of the host.

5
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,030
There was a time, long ago, when our town was called by that name.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,660
Those dream-filled Shinjuku skies upon which Japanese hosts once gazed upon their dreams...

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,530
are now filled with words by hosts from foreign countries.

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,890
However, there were two men.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,330
The enigmatic vagrant, Gintoki Sakata

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,500
and the former number one host, Shinpachi Buttchin.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,860
The two of them still run in this corrupt night town.

[Episode 2]

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,210
The man with fluttering golden hair

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,320
glided through the city

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,540
as though he were the Golden Knight.

17
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,540
[Note: Gin is called the White Knight in regular Gin Tama.]

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,960
Gin-san, I beg of you!

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,740
Aim for the top with me!

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,130
Hopeless fool.

21
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,880
I'll dance with you, Shinpachi.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,670
What a pain.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,880
This place is like a cesspool.

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,220
Who are you?

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,390
Kagura.

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,190
I command you.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,800
Swear fealty to me.

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,810
If you do, I'll grant your wishes.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,400
The men do not realize they are dancing on thin ice.

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,780
What?

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,150
That's fine.

32
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,430
Climb up if you can!

33
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,470
And the women sharpen their red nails.

34
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,590
The wheel of fate is rusty.

35
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,380
It doesn't move until it's too late.

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,410
Dance a waltz for me...

37
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,410
[Note: This is Zurako, or crossdressing Katsura.]

38
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,330
I eagerly await the show...

39
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,400
Yes.

40
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,680
Nobody could have predicted

41
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:28,510
that Buttchin here would play a critical role in the conclusion of this story...

42
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,590

[Note: "Kai" means "Revised." This is a parody of the new Dragon Ball Kai anime.]

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,900
This week, we will be called "Gin Tama Kai"

47
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:16,580
and show a re-edited director's cut, 16:9 HD remastered version of the infamous episode 151!

Hey!

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,400
What do you mean, that infamous episode 151?!

52
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,070
That's the episode that aired last week!

53
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,240
And isn't this just a summary of the previous episode?!

54
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,980
You don't need to make chancy references every other line!

And it's 16:9 because the top and bottom were chopped off!

I'm not!

59
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,270
Oh, are you there?

60
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,720
Sorry I'm late.

61
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,010
I came to return volume 7 of Abu-san.

65
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,900
Katakuriko, what is this place?

66
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,060
Hmm? The barbershop I frequent.

67
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,170
I was going to introduce you to my buddy, but he doesn't seem to be here.

Fascinating.

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,980
Will you do my hair in a mage?

That elegant bearing!

80
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,490
That humble penis!

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,260
Wh-Why?!

82
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,820
Why is the Shogun in such a filthy place?!

83
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,070
Will you do my hair in a mage?

84
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,210
Eh? You want a mage done?

85
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,140
Here?

86
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,090
What about hitting the hostess bar?

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,480
You're not coming?

88
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,700
Is this old guy still taking the Shogun around and teaching him the wrong things?!

89
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,720
I shall return this to the owner for you.

90
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,320
Go on ahead and have a drink.

91
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,380
Eh?

92
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,720
I do not disguise myself as a commoner and roam the streets to indulge in pleasure.

93
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,300
My purpose is to learn the lifestyle of the commoners of Edo.

94
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,040
One who leads must understand how those below feel.

95
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,990
This is a perfect opportunity.

96
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,940
No, no, no, no, no, no, leave!

Eh?

98
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,850
Seriously?

99
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,000
You're going to get your hair cut here?

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,420
Like we're going to shave the Shogun's head!

101
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,240
Please leave!

102
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,920
You've got odd tastes.

103
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,160
Then I'll head to the usual place.

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,370
Come when you're done.

105
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,130
Wait!

106
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,210
Take him with you!

107
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,460
You're going to run off to a hostess bar and leave the Shogun here all alone?!

108
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,030
Well, nobody will recognize you in that costume.

109
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,420
You shouldn't need any bodyguards.

110
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,750
No, he needs them!

111
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,220
You're in one hell of a hurry to get to your hostess bar, old guy!

112
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,870
Then say "Hello" to him for me.

113
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,710
Hey, wait up!

114
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,010
Perverted old man!

115
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,240
Then, I'm in your hands.

116
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,170
Wh-What do we do?

117
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,840
What are we supposed to do?!

118
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,650
Cut the Shogun's hair!

119
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,750
No, no, no, no!

120
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,960
Not happening. Not happening. Not happening.

121
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,830
Wait, Shogun-sama!

122
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,390
We aren't even barbers!

123
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,490
What are we going to do, Gin-san?!

124
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,580
What should we do?!

125
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,830
How would I know?!

126
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,070
Don't expect me to know the answer to everything!

127
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,030
There are things I don't know!

128
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,240
There are times when I want to cry!

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,690
There are times when I want to run away!

130
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,860
That's why I said to run for it!

131
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,700
The two of you had to dawdle around!

132
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,340
What do we do?

133
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,740
Forget running away...

134
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,980
If we screw up his haircut...

135
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,770
All three of us will lose our heads.

Oboroshaa!!

138
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,010
He puked?!

139
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,620
I'm sorry...

140
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,190
I was so nervous my gag reflex kicked in.

141
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,420
I can't go on any longer.

142
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,160
Why are you trying to back out by yourself already?!

143
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,420
Get a grip!

144
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,390
Pathetic.

145
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,620
Doesn't matter if he's the Shogun or whatever.

146
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,180
The hair on his head is the same as everybody else's.

147
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
I'll go.

148
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,890
W-Welcome.

149
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,230
Whoa! There she goes!

150
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,530
Impressive!

151
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,160
How would you like your hair done today?

152
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,770
A crew cut?

153
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,030
Parted in the front?

154
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,740
A mushroo-

155

[Note: Puking sound.]

157
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,470
Okay!

158
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,370
One, two, three!

159
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,930
What are you doing?!

160
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,970
Do you want to die?!

161
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,590
The smell from Shinpachi got to me.

162
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,930
It got the better of me.

163
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,410
Don't you give me that!

164
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,550
What if you had barfed on him?!

165
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,980
Don't worry.

166
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,410
We're barely okay.

167
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,750
The Shogun is...

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,820
Did the Shogun have a mark on his forehead?

170
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,620
[Note: Naruto is a fishcake usually on top of ramen.]

171
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,680
Looks like a naruto...

172
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,620
Ah, from the ramen I had for lunch...

173
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,720
I should have digested that.

174
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,910
That's not the issue here!

175
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,920
What do we do?

176
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,600
It's stuck to his forehead.

177
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,040
That's as bad as if he had "meat" written on his forehead!

178
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,370
[Note: From Kinniku-man (Ultimate Muscle) by Yude Tamago.]

179
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,740
This is bad!

180
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,370
The Shogun's staring at the mirror!

181
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,060
Cover it up!

182
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,480
Somebody cover it up!

183
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,410
O-Oh?

184
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,740
Hey! Who drew a naruto on the mirror?!

185
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,030
Ah, sorry!

186
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,930
That would be me!

187
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,900
You want me to kill you?!

188
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,710
So sorry, sir.

189
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,890
Don't worry.

190
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,620
This is just something on the mirror.

191
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,060
You'd better wipe the mirror off!

192
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,080
Yes!

193
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,610
I'm really very sorry.

194
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,840
I'm always telling him off, really.

195
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,770
Ah, I'm going to steam your face now.

196
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,370
Honestly...

197
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,730
These young ones never learn.

198
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,450
Young people these days quit the second you scold them.

199
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,740
They slack off the moment you aren't looking.

200
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,820
What a worthless bunch.

201
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,910
Then how do you want your hair cut today?

202
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,330
In that case, could you redo my mage?

203
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,250
Ah, yes. Understood.

204
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,670
Then I'll shave your face while I'm shaving your forehead.

205
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,010
Yes, please.

206
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,130
Why?!

207
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:17,720
Then!

208
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,520
Then I'll need you to lie down for now.

209
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,600
Please keep your eyes closed.

210
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,890
This is bad!

211
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,650
I can't get the naruto off!

212
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,910
Like it doesn't want to come off!

[Note: Shadow Clone Jutsu from NARUTO, used to create multiple copies of the user.]

214
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,530
Like the one that uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu!

215
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,070
Calm down!

216
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,770
Nobody's using any Shadow Clone Jutsu.

217
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,100
There were two stacked on top of each other to begin with.

218
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,120
What are we going to do about that?!

219
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,460
Looks like he has Sharingan!

220
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:45,140
[Note: Sharingan is an eye technique from NARUTO, used to memorize and replicate an opponent's jutsu.]

221
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm too scared to go near him!

222
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,160
He might steal my special techniques!

223
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,140
I've never seen any Sharingan that dirty!

224
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,510
And you don't have any special techniques!

225
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,870
That's why Bandai Namco's having a hard time, 'cause they can't put out any fighting games!

226
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,260
Hey! Somebody do something about this!

227
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,520
Remove them while pretending to shave his face!

228
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,490
Hey!

229
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,880
Why me?!

230
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,750
I can't do it with my bare hands.

231
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,900
It keeps slipping.

232

How oily was the ramen you ate?!

234
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,180
We can slide it off with a razor.

235
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,710
Hey! That's dangerous!

236
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,140
Careful. Be careful.

237
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,570
I know.

238
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,870
Uh, excuse me.

239
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,370
How long do I have to wait...

240
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,850
We're in the middle of something important here, so shut up, dying gorilla!

241
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,630
Who knows what I'll end up cutting off if my hand slips?

242
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,420
Okay!

243
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,840
Ah, it's working!

244
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,240
Oh, I took it off.

245
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,330
Wow! Way to go!

246
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,620
Remove the other shadow clone, too.

247
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,110
Whoa...

248
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,830
I did it! I got it off!

249
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,610
You did it, Kagura-chan!

250
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,890
Whew...

251
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,070
We made it through the first stage.

Can't you keep this place clean?!

269

We've got golden retriever shit lying around!

270

No! That can't be right!

271
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,700
That was definitely the Shogun's mage!

272
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,310
You hid the evidence at the speed of light, but it was obvious that his mage came off!

273
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,240
You're wrong!

274
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,810
That was absolutely golden retriever shit!

275
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,010
The color! The size!

276
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,650
It could only be golden retriever shit!

Nothing more! Nothing less!

278

Where is there even a golden retriever?!

Th-This is terrible!

280
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,680
You cut off his mage while you were removing the naruto!

281
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,660
That doesn't happen from a slip of the hand!

282
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,010
What are we going to do?!

283
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,460
Even committing seppuku won't be enough for this!

284
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,370
C-C-C-Calm down! Calm down, Shinpachi!

285
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,940
Without his mage, the Shogun is just a baldie!

286
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,870
With a huge forehead!

287

Like someone cosplaying as a fallen warrior!

288
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,420
Yeah, you could even say that the mage makes the Shogun!

289
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,090
But if you were to put golden retriever shit on the Shogun's head,

290
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,750
anybody would remove it!

291
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,360
That's what a samurai would do!

292
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,520
That's what a loyal subject would do!

293
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,430
A samurai who calls the General's mage shit is not a samurai!

I-I-It's fine!

295
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,090
Definitely fine!

Never give up!

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,760
Why are you singing about life?!

299
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,400
You think that superficial phrases are going to solve our problem?!

300
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,540
But! But!

301
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,140
It's just a little shorter!

302
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,560
We just trimmed his hair!

303
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,430
We can still do this!

304
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,710
We can still pull together a mage!

305
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,410
E-Excuse me.

306
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,720
Let me try to tie this.

307
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,270
That's not even close to being long enough!

308
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,970
This is impossible!

309
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,260
It's fine!

310
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,530
I'm just not pulling hard enough!

311
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,930
Have to go like this!

312
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,710
Hey!

313
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,920
You're gonna pull it out!

314
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Pulling his hair out! Out!

315
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,950

If we give up, there will be no mage!

Gin-san! The Shogun is tearing up!

319

He can't take any more!

Ow! Ow! Ow!

322
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,040
Stop it!

323
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,730
Please stop it!

325

Tie it together!

326
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,170
Tie it together while I'm holding it up!

327
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,270
It's impossible.

328
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,410
Impossible!

329
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,980
Okay, we're done.

330
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,200
Uh, he looks different now.

331
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,720
His face is all stretched!

332
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,420
Like he's got a stocking over his head!

333
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,710
Hey, he seems to like it?

334

Isn't he smiling?

335
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,670
[Note: Thailand is known as the Land of Smiles.]

336
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,570
Like he's from the Land of Smiles?

337
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,800
He isn't!

338
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,670
His skin is all lifted!

339
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,470
Huh? He's mad?

340
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,330
Is he smiling?

341
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,770
I can't tell.

342
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,770
I can't read his expression at all.

343
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,930
I guarantee you that he's not smiling!

344
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm sorry!

345
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,480
We'll fix this right away!

346
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,900
It's no good, Gin-san!

347
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,400
If we let him leave like this, we'll definitely lose our heads!

348
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,990
We have to do something!

349
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,680
As long as he's satisfied when he leaves, the rest doesn't matter!

350
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,330
We just have to get past this situation!

351
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,080
We can just throw together something that looks right and run for it!

352
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,950
The mage!

353
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,450
That's right! The mage!

354
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,510
We can force it onto his head and fool him!

355
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,210
Uh-oh, Shinpachi!

356
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,280
A golden retriever took the mage and ran away!

357
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,340
What?!

358
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,560
I'll go and get it back!

359
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,580
Take care of the rest!

360
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,010
Wait, Kagura-chan!

361
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,520
Damn it...

362
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,870
Why won't anything work...

363
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,700
What do we have to do...

364
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,320
Hey, Shinpachi.

365
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,290
Gin-san!

366
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,850
Th-That...

367
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,320
What's that mage?!

368
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,990
Where did you find it?

369
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,490
I didn't find it.

370
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,510
I made it.

371
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,500
What?!

372
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
We didn't have one so I had to make one.

373
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,180
Wait...

374
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,210
You made it...?

375
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,520
That's amazing!

376
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,040
I'm impressed, Gin-san!

377
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,750
You're like that Waku Waku san!!

378
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,520
[Note: Waku Waku san is from "Tsukutte Asobo," an NHK craft show for kids.]

379
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,520
We'll just glue it on...

380
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,280
Okay, all done.

381
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,210
It's perfect, Gin-san!

382
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,760
This will work!

383
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,410
This should be enough to fool the Shogun...

384
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,930
Huh?

385
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,950
After a closer look...

386
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,940
Huh?

387
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,620
Isn't this mage kind of shrinking?

388
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,430
Excuse me.

389
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,020
How did you make this mage?

390
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
It was growing in the bushes next door.

391
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,060
What kind of bushes are those?!

392
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,520
What are you doing?!

393
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,340
How can you put something so disgusting on the head

394
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,040
of the most important man in this country?!

395
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,690
Well, he said that one who leads must understand how those below feel.

396
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,500
Below doesn't mean down there!

397
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,880
But doesn't the Shogun like it?

398
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,380
Isn't he smiling?

399
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,110
I told you already that he isn't smiling!

400
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,070
And how long do you intend to keep the Shogun's face stretched like that?!

401
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,960
Free him already!

402
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,020
I can't decide if he's mad or laughing.

403
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,140
Huh?

404
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,390
Something's growing up there.

405
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,310
Hey!

406
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,320
He's been infected by something!

407
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,010
I'm sorry!

408
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,170
We'll fix it right away!

409
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,500
This is no good, Gin-san!

410
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,690
Use someone else!

411
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,980
Isn't there anyone else to use?!

412
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,110
Someone else?

413
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,640
No choice then.

414
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,100
I'll use Zura's hair down there then...

415
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,620
Why down there?!

416
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,720
Can't you just use the hair on his head?!

417
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,070
I'm trying to keep him from finding out.

418
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,940
Using his pubes won't keep him from finding out!

419
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,520
Katsura-san's hair is long enough

420
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,670
that you can cut some off without him finding out, right?!

421
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,290
You're right.

422
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,600
Sorry, Zura.

423
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,250
I'll be taking some of this.

424
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,120
Why from his bangs?!

425
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,720
Look at how long it is in the back!

426
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,280
Why would you take it from the front?!

427
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,360
And it's too late now!

428
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,420
You've limited any way to style his hair now!

429
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,220
What are you going to do about those bangs?!

430
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,280
Ah?

431
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,000
This looks weird 'cause there's a little left.

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,860
So I just need to cut his bangs off completely.

433
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,670
See?

434
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,360
Is he supposed to be Little Lord Fauntleroy?!

435
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:04,630
[Note: Hairstyle for Cedric from "Little Lord Fauntleroy" anime series.]

436
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,800
I get it already.

437
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,900
It won't stand out if I shorten it all around.

438
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,630
Huh?

439
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,160
Like this?

440
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,370
Okay!

441
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,120
That isn't Katsura-san anymore!

442
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,170
It's Wakame-san!

443
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,660
[Note: Wakame is a character from Sazae-san.]

444
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,330
Forget it.

445
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,660
I've decided Zura gets a crew cut.

446
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,710
He gave up.

447
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,380
This guy chose a fine time to stop trying!

448
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,540
Anyway, back to the mage.

449
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,580
We should be able to fool him with this.

450
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,480
Huh?

451
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,240
Well, with hair this silky,

452
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,560
we should be able to make something as good as his old one.

453
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,850
Well, isn't it a little too silky?

454
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,460
That's not where it goes!

455
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,030
Well, I'd feel guilty about leaving him like this.

456
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,330
Since we're also dealing with a Shogun here.

457
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,580
Shogun of what?!

458
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,410
[Note: Nickname for a musician, Hiroshi "Monsieur" Kamayatsu.]

459
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,410
And this is no Shogun! It's a Monsieur!

460
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,760
[Note: Geta sandal is from the song by Hiroshi Kamayatsu "To my good friend".]

461
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,760
Well, he won't tap on his geta sandals, but it can still get the job done.

462
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,200
That's not the issue here!

463
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,330
Gin-san! Forget the little man and get back to the mage!

464
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,430
Hurry!

465
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,800
Before he finds out! Hurry!

466
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,570
I get it already.

467
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,510
Not there!

468
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,070
Where are you making a mage?!

469
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,380
Doesn't it look just as good as it did before?

470
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,520
Forget about that Shogun already!

471
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,610
The one over here!

472
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,700
If you don't hurry, we might lose our heads!

473
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,990
Gin-chan! Shinpachi!

474
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,520
Kagura-chan!

475
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,950
I managed to get it back.

476
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,720
Really?!

477
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,860
Great job!

478
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,060
I'm amazed that you were able to get it back.

479
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,140
I thought we'd never see it again.

480
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,570
It was hard, but I managed somehow.

481
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,970
With this, we should be fine.

482
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,280
Now, put it on the Shogun's head, quick!

483
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,640
Here you go.

484
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,960
Huh?

485
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,270
What is this?

486
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,180
Why is there a mosaic over it?

487
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,120
Why does it smell funny?

488
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,400
It was so hard.

489
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,620
I had to look all over town for the right size of golden retriever sh-

490
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,280
Excuse me.

491
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,320
Do I have to keep waiting?

492
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,990
I would expect the shampoo to have permeated my hair by now...

493
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,810
What?

494
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,170
It's awfully noisy.

495
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,880
I had no idea...

496
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,580
The commoners braid mage under such foul conditions...

497
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,910
I had no idea...

498
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,380
I knew nothing at all...

499
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,110
Reform is needed...

500
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:36,120
Edo will have no future if I do not reform barbershops!

501
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,190
What was that?

502
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,240
I couldn't tell if he was crying or laughing.

503
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,090
Anyway, when am I going to get my hair cut?

504
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,430
I've been waiting for a long time.

505
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,540
You too?

506
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,840
So have I...

507
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:08,990
And so it was that the barbershop received government money to rebuild.

508
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,530
With a magnificent building and barbers from across the land,

509
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,080
the place soon became the number one barbershop in Edo.

510
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:33,180
[WANTED]

511
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:31,870
However, few were aware that three barbers had risked their lives in the shadows to save this shop.

512
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,900
[The End]

513
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,730
Can't sleep...

514
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,200
Not even a wink. Not the tiniest bit at all. In fact, I'm waking up.

515
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,380
Can't sleep...

516
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,050
The next episode...

517
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,730
"Sleep Helps a Child Grow."

518
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,450
I wanna grow.

519
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,190
[I've gotta get up at seven tomorrow...]

520
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,900
[I can't sleep at all at this hour.]

521
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,520
[See you next time!]
