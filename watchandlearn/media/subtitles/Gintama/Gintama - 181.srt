2
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,640
I wish you had told me this sooner.

3
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,120
I wish you had allowed me
to share your burden.

4
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,730
If the master's duty is to shoulder
the student along with their pain,

5
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,300
what is the student's duty?

6
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,140
To grow strong enough
to shoulder the master.

7
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,890
You're light...

8
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,060
So light, Master...

9
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,070
I never knew you were so light...

10
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,660
Can you see, Master?

11
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,200
Yes...

12
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,570
I can see...

13
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,970
A moon more beautiful...

14
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,270
than any... I've ever seen...

15
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,450
That's one helluva student.

16
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,920
A student's duty is to grow strong enough
to shoulder the master, huh?

17
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,540
I was always relying on my old man,

18
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,980
so I was never able to do that.

19
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,620
...Same here.

20
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,340
Reconstruction is coming
along smoothly.

21
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,470
Boy, that's a relief.

22
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,280
At this rate, Yoshiwara will be
back to the way it was in no time.

23
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,520
We were able to keep the
damage to a minimum.

24
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,940
And miraculously, there
were no casualties.

25
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,010
Oh, I need to thank that ninja, too.

26
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,080
Will he be coming by again?

27
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,510
He's probably drinking at some
cabaret full of fuglies.

28
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,090
In any case, how has Tsukuyo-san
been doing?

29
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,910
She's recovered from
her physical injuries,

30
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,670
but her emotional scars, well...

31
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,520
She's been in her room
since the incident.

32
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,250
Who can blame her?

33
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,240
She went through so much.

34
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,330
And she also feels responsible.

35
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,030
She believes it's her fault
that this happened.

36
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,460
But it isn't Tsukky's fault.

37
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,980
Should we go cheer her up?

38
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,790
Just leave her alone.

39
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,890
She's been working nonstop
this whole time.

40
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,870
Probably feels like taking
a break for a change.

41
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,000
That's true...

42
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,080
Oh, that's it!

43
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,500
Since she's taking a break,

44
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,200
we should take her out.

45
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,880
It'll be a good change of pace.

46
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,880
Why are you coming up with ideas
that mean more work for us?

47
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,830
I won't do it.

48
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,890
I'm gonna hit the pachinko parlor.

49
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,060
That's a wonderful idea.

50
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,020
Please.

51
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,940
She was always working so she's
never been to the surface.

52
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,600
Introduce her to a place
where she can relax.

53
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,260
Say, Hinowa-san...

54
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,500
Weren't you listening to me?

55
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,460
You're pretty abusive, huh?

56
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,170
Rattling off request after request.

57
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,560
Tsukuyo-chan!

58
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,820
Let's go play!

59
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,420
Hey, wake up, damn it.

60
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,450
We're hitting the pachinko parlor.

61
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,310
You probably got a bunch
saved up, right?

62
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,720
I'll blow it all for you.

63
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,220
Huh? She isn't here?

64
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,380
Forget it. Just leave her alone.

65
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,070
I'm leaving.

66
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,000
I feel like I'm gonna hit
something big today.

67
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,360
...Jackpot?

68
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,520
The hell are you doing?!

69
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,980
["Watch Out For A Set of Women and A Drink"]

70
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,820
I see...

71
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,960
You all thought I was feeling
down from the incident.

72
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,200
Looks like I made everyone worry.

73
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,130
Sorry to cause unnecessary concern.

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,320
But as you can see, I'm fine.

75
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,590
You don't need to worry.

76
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,250
Yeah, no kidding.

77
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,240
Too fine, if you ask me.

78
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,020
Great to hear.

79
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,370
Really, that's great to hear.

80
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,290
Uh, we heard that you were too
depressed to leave your room.

81
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,870
Yes, I was somewhat injured.

82
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,980
Hinowa would give me an
earful if I went out to work.

83
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,130
I did a little acting and
pretended to sleep,

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,650
before sneaking outside
through a side exit.

85
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,580
Huh?

86
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,960
You were still working after that?!

87
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,320
In that condition?!

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,530
Of course.

89
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,140
Yoshiwara has taken a big hit.

90
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,500
I can't be resting, just
because I'm injured.

91
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,750
Besides, even if the illegal
drugs have disappeared,

92
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,340
crime is still a problem in Yoshiwara.

93
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,990
I don't have time to sleep
or be depressed.

94
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,630
Well, I made Hinowa and the
others worry unnecessarily.

95
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,180
I've recovered from my injuries.

96
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,210
I should start working in the open

97
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,340
and show them that I'm doing fine.

98
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
There you have it.

99
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Sorry to cause you trouble,

100
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,890
but I don't need a vacation to rejuvenate.

101
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm fine now.

102
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,090
Thank you for everything.

103
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,720
I'm too busy right now,

104
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,780
but at some point, I'd like
to properly thank you.

105
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,490
I can't provide much service,
but enjoy your stay.

106
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,730
Tsukuyo-san hasn't changed.

107
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,300
She's still the same.

108
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,880
Never letting anyone else
see her weak side.

109
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
She just doesn't know how to open up.

110
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
I thought she would have changed
after everything that happened.

111
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,360
I guess people can't change so easily.

112
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,500
She'll let us know when
she's really suffering.

113
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,520
She just puts that off considerably
more than the average person.

114
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,410
But Gin-san...

115
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,550
That just means she's pushing
herself too hard.

116
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,820
Leave her alone.

117
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,820
There isn't anything for us to do.

118
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,110
I wanted to let her take a break.

119
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,880
Guess that won't happen
if she would rather work.

120
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,130
But she'll ruin her health if she
keeps pushing herself like that!

121
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,370
If she won't take a break, we just have
to help her rejuvenate on the job.

122
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,280
There wouldn't be any problem
if it was that easy.

123
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,970
Are you telling her to play around
or drink while working?

124
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,420
What kind of job...

125
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
Oh...!

126
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,980
Welcome, savior of Yoshiwara!

127
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,060
Thank you for coming.

128
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,440
Now, come this way.

129
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,550
Um...

130
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,090
I came because I was told there'd
be free drinks, but is that for real?

131
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,860
I'm flat-out broke.

132
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,160
Since I lost at pachinko.

133
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,580
Yes, it's our way of saying thanks.

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,410
You've saved Yoshiwara so many times.

135
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,850
Please enjoy yourself tonight.

136
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,120
Whoa, is this for real?!

137
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,870
Are you saying I can have free drinks,

138
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,630
AND also try some seaweed sake?

139
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,740
Oh, don't just stop at seaweed, sir.

140
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,090
Anything from dancing clams
to picking chestnuts.

141
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,020
Hold it! You shouldn't get nuts involved!

142
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,860
I'll end up with a Mont Blanc, you know?!

143
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,530
Cook myself some rice with nuts!

144
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,440
Is that really okay?!

145
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,990
That's fine!

146
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,180
Enjoy yourself all you want.

147
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,530
You know, call me if you ever
need any help again.

148
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,020
I'll come flying at a moment's notice.

149
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,050
I'll cook nut rice at a moment's notice.

150
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,890
Yeah, it's a good thing I didn't
bring Shinpachi and Kagura.

151
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,190
You'll be in this room.

152
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,200
Then please enjoy yourselves.

153
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,940
W-Welcome.

154
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,870
Ah, hello there.

155
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,770
I am the Courtesan of Death, Tsukuyo.

156
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,410
Please enjoy your...

157
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,490
I am the Courtesan of Death, Tsukuyo.

158
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,390
Please enjoy your...

159
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,260
Change!

160
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,480
Change please!

161
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,170
Get me a girl who's more friendly!!

162
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,910
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

163
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,090
Why are you here?

164
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,840
That's my line!

165
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,060
Why are you...!

166
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,320
Nobody mentioned this!

167
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,060
Any drink will taste bad when served
by such a grumpy woman.

168
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,950
Hinowa requested me to perform
this important job.

169
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,420
She said that an important customer
would be coming.

170
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,370
The other girls are busy with Yoshiwara's
reconstruction so they can't help.

171
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,950
Please, Tsukuyo.

172
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,810
Could you at least pour a drink for him?

173
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,030
I was told that this was an important job.

174
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,110
T-those bastards got me good...

175
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,360
So much for providing me service...

176
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,710
They were just using me to
help rejuvenate this woman.

177
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,690
It looks like Gin-san's figured
out what's going on.

178
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,580
I'm sorry, Gin-san.

179
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,710
Tsukuyo isn't the type of girl
to rest during her time off.

180
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,490
I have to use the pretense of a
job to allow her to take it easy.

181
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,490
Please help her relax.

182
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm sure that Gin-san can do it.

183
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,490
I can't be sure,

184
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,700
but I assume that Hinowa was
trying to say that serving you,

185
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,780
someone who's saved Yoshiwara
many times,

186
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,390
was also an important job.

187
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,880
That I represent the women of
Yoshiwara in thanking you.

188
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,430
No, I'm pretty sure it's
nothing that formal.

189
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,990
No matter, I also wanted
to show my appreciation.

190
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,010
Is this good enough?

191
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,750
Do I look like a corrupt politician to you?!

192
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,420
What kind of appreciation is that?!

193
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,760
Hinowa would never tell you to do that!

194
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,090
But she told me to provide service.

195
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,340
Not THAT kind of service!

196
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,720
For someone so pure, you
sure know your stuff!

197
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,190
You really are a woman of Yoshiwara!

198
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,900
What am I supposed to do then?

199
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,190
I've never been in one
of these rooms before.

200
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,730
Guess I don't have a choice.

201
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,780
For now, just drink.

202
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,630
A lot's happened,

203
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,620
but for today, just forget it all and drink.

204
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,000
That's your job today.

205
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,760
That's our Gin-san.

206
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,030
He knows what to do.

207
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,090
Oh, she drank.

208
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,250
Mom, she drank.

209
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,250
That's wonderful. This is how
it should be, Tsukuyo.

210
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,190
You can hold your liquor, huh?

211
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,420
She looks like a normal girl now.

212
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,240
You should relax and rest every
once in a while, Tsukuyo.

213
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,440
Hey, don't drink it all. Pour me some.

214
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,700
Man, who's serving who here?

215
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,370
Huh?

216
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,070
Pour.

217
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,060
Pour!

218
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,280
Huh?!

219
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,370
I said there ain't enough liquor!

220
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,620
Bring the whole damn barrel!

221
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,710
Wha-

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,720
W-who the hell is THAT?!

223
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,280
She's turned into a completely different
person after one shot?!

224
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,440
She's not just cutting loose anymore!

225
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,750
Something more important just got loose!

226
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,930
Hey, damn it!

227
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,440
How long you gonna lie there?!

228
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,120
Hold it, hold it!!

229
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,050
That definitely isn't a normal girl!

230
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,720
She's acting like a drunk old man!

231
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,610
Gin-chan!

232
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,240
She's gonna kill Gin-chan!

233
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,510
Hey, wake up.

234
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,730
It's too early to get smashed.

235
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,230
The night's only begun.

236
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,870
Yeah, s-sorry...

237
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,290
I suddenly lost consciousness.

238
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,930
Maybe I drank too much.

239
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,130
Th-That's odd.

240
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,980
Maybe I should l-l-leave.

241
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,550
You come to my house and think that
you can leave before the sun rises?

242
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,430
I'm joking. Please forgive
me, Lady Tsukuyo.

243
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,900
I'll accompany you till morning.

244
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,460
I'll kill all the morning birds and
accompany you till morning,

245
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,610
But um, Lady...

246
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,770
When did we start drinking together?

247
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,710
Was there a change at some point?

248
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,580
I was with the Lady to begin with?

249
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,180
You're the Lady, right?

250
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Obviously!

251
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,140
I dressed up and prepared
all this liquor for you today!

252
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,650
I'm gonna kill you, bastard!

253
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,640
I-I never knew...

254
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,040
That she had such low
tolerance for alcohol...

255
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,700
Come to think of it,
I've never let her drink before.

256
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,160
This is way beyond low tolerance.

257
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,220
The alcohol is releasing some
kind of unknown power.

258
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,400
Okay, I'm gonna entertain
you good today.

259
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,410
We've had plenty to drink,

260
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,480
so let's play a game.

261
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,920
Look thataway.

262
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,470
N-No, it's okay.

263
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,390
I'm happy just to drink by your side.

264
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,080
Don't you know this game?

265
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,830
The loser has to remove
an article of clothing.

266
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,460
No, it's okay.

267
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,860
You don't have to push yourself, Lady.

268
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,850
What's that? You don't
wanna see me naked?

269
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,460
You have no interest?

270
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,220
No, that's not true.

271
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,870
But you're drunk right now,

272
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,310
so you'll regret it later.

273
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,520
So you wanna see.

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,490
Perv.

275
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,770
Gintoki's a perv.

276
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,240
Such a pain! This lady is
such a pain in the ass!!

277
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,140
Then if I lose, I'll take something off,

278
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,480
so if you lose, you also
take something off...

279
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,820
Like your skin.

280
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,060
Lady, look up the word "fair"
in the dictionary and circle it!

281
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,280
Here we go!

282
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,210

283
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,600

284
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,680
Look thataway!

285
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,590
Lady, this is already punishment enough!

286
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,950
Again!

287
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,680
Rock, paper, scissors!

288
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,820
Okay!

289
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,640
Look thataway!

290
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,000
Lady, I still lose when I win!

291
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,890
Rock, paper, fist!

292
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,810
Look thataway and bam!

293
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,280
One more time!

294
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,760
Stand up, damn it!

295
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,110
Rock, paper, scissors!

296
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,810
Tsukuyo's having so much fun.

297
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,960
She looks like an ordinary girl now.

298
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,900
How?!

299
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,400
Okay, let's play cards next.

300
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,570
Hey, the people hiding over
there should join in.

301
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,760
I'll kill you if you don't show yourselves
in three seconds.

302
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,380
Ready? One, two...

303
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,710
No more, please...

304
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,810
Going on patrol?

305
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,040
In the end, you never change.

306
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,540
Say, if...

307
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,450
If I didn't have this scar...

308
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,070
Could I have lived a different life?

309
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,270
You wouldn't be any different.

310
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,290
That's the path you've chosen,
your way of life.

311
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,410
There's no need to regret it.

312
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,790
There's no need to feel any shame.

313
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,420
You, and nobody else, chose
this path yourself.

314
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,490
Walk tall.

315
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,520
Your face isn't ugly.

316
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,530
It's a pretty face carrying a clean soul.

317
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,110
Gintoki...

318
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,740
I'm glad to have met you all.

[The Kiheitai]

I don't have a Lolita complex.
I'm a feminist.

Don't ever call them my chums again.

340
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,310
There are no warm feelings
between us anymore.

341

When did our paths diverge?

[Their beginnings were the same...]

343
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,950
We may have started
from the same place.

344
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,160
But we've been looking to
different things ever since.

[The excitement returns to the big screen!]

349
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,060
So that is Gintoki Sakata
and Kotaro Katsura.

350
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,530
They are strong...

351

I'd like to face off with them some time.

GinTama can finally join the
other popular Jump anime.

359

Uh, no!

360
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,500
This is that fake movie preview
we used last time!

361
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,280
So after the fake ending scam, we're
going to have a fake movie scam?!

362
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,910
Well, the decision came so suddenly
that there wasn't any time,

363
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,580
and then we were like,
we can just use this.

You're still making excuses?!

365
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,510
Might as well skip the effort and reuse
footage for the movie itself.

366
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,260
Toss in a few new scenes
and you'll fool them all.

That won't work!

Really?

Most of Sunrise's movies
