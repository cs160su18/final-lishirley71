[Heiji Kozenigata is a hard-boiled detective in pursuit of Chogoro the Foxfire.]

3
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,080
[When the authorities are warned that the Golden Fried Tofu Statue is going to be stolen, he violates his suspension and rushes to the scene.]

["Hard-Boiled Eggs Don't Crack"]

5
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,360
Hey, what's that sound?

6
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,330
Is it coming from outside?

7
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,040
Arley!

8
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,130
Davidson!

9
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,880
A-An intruder! From the front door!

10
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,730
Is it the Fox?!

11
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,960
No, she's wearing full body tights!

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,000
What?! Tights?! What's going on?!

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,840
She's on a rampage-shouting things like she can't control her youthfulness!

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,790
She might be heading for Mt. Fuji!

15
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,170
[Note: Biker gangs in Japan often drive to Mount Fuji for meetings.]

16
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,170
What's with that offbeat description of her rampage?

17
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,290
I may not look it, but I used to be a bad dude.

18
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,480
People who talk like that are usually the ones who haven't done much.

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,090
You know, like **** and ****.

20
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,270
Should you be mentioning names?

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,540
Never mind! Arrest anyone who looks suspicious! Alert mode, on!

22
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,610
Roger that.

23
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,140
Today, the game is over! Full-body tights!

24
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,300
No, it's the Fox!

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,250
Looks like they're moving out in full force.

26
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,790
Come on, if they attract too much attention, won't the Fox tuck his tail and run?

27
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,030
I don't think that'll happen.

28
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,130
He went to the trouble of announcing his crime.

29
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,650
The Fox would have anticipated this level of security.

30
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,610
He'll come for sure. A man always needs to expose himself to danger...

31
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,160
He's a bloodthirsty beast that can't live without it.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,870
Hey! Hide! What're you doing?!

33
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,260
What're you drinking wine for?!

34
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,240
This isn't wine It's Camus.

35
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,740
I just can't stop shaking.

36
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:14,600
Seems the beast inside of me is getting antsy, as well.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,060
He's totally scared-scared so stiff he's puking.

38
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,460
You're a fool. Stop drinking that wine already.

39
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,630
We all know you're not really hard-boiled.

40
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,100
This isn't wine. It's Camus.

41
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,890
[Note: Amuro is a main character from the first GUNDAM. Camus is a main character from Z GUNDAM.]

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,730
Camus, Amuro, what's the difference?

43
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,890
Stop using alcohol to get rid of your jitters!

44
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,210
Gin-san, please get a hold of yourself! You're puking...

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,290
C'mon, pull yourselves together. Ugh, what an awful sour smell!

46
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,280
What's the matter with you people?!

47
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,750
What're you doing there?

48
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,410
Huh?

49
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,700
It's you, Haji?

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,570
There's nothing suspicious over here!

51
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,270
Something smells...

52
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,870
Didn't I just see someone?

53
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,820
No, it was just me.

54
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,980
Haji, weren't you taken off duty today?

55
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,880
No, I couldn't stay home knowing the Fox is showing up.

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,000
You're quite the go-getter.

57
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,390
Uh! I already checked over there.

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
This is too close...too close. They'll spot us.

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,490
Take off those glasses. What're you wearing glasses with armor for?!

60
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,070
Glasses are armor for the eyes.

61
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,810
We're sa...

62
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,480
...fe...?

63
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,250
Do you remember a statue like this?

64
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,810
That's a statue of Leyasu.

65
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,990
Pin pon pan pon.

66
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,010
You are looking at a statue of the moment when a hard-boiled assassin

67
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,790
ambushed Lord Leyasu during an unguarded moment while the lord was hawking.

68
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,010
There's...

69
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,230
no such statue!

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,830
Kozenigata! Damn you!

71
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,990
You're on suspension! What're you doing here?!

72
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,970
Tsk, now I'll definitely be fired unless I apprehend the Fox and restore my honor.

73
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,610
Hmph, I'm looking forward to it.

74
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,060
Okay, let's head back to the bar and regroup.

75
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,720
You're not looking forward to it at all! You're running away!

76
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,460
What do you mean, "head back to the bar"? We never went to a bar!

77
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,450
That was a cheap roadside drinking stand!

78
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,500
That's a bar. I can't go into fancy bars-they make me nervous.

79
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,360
You really don't have an ounce of hard-boiled in you!

80
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,050
Haji!

81
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,000
Boss!

82
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,450
The...Fox?!

83
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,470
He appeared! The Fox appeared!

84
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,900
Apprehend-

85
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,710
What?! In the blink of an eye!

86
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,540
That bastard!

87
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,660
He's mocking us!

88
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,890
Boss... Did the Fox...just save me...?

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,500
Hmph... No way...

90
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,870
But that Fox somehow seems familiar...

91
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,060
We chased after the Fox, but were unable to capture him in the end.

92
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,530
We returned to the bar to regroup.

93
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,640
Hey, stop going on with your story!

94
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,730
How badly do you want to go to a bar?!

95
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,620
Can't you do anything without going to a bar first?!

96
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,350
After the bastard!

97
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,750
We decided to regroup at a bar or while playing a game of pool.

98
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,450
No playing pool, either! We're going, dummy!

99
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,230
No mistake. It's the Fox.

100
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,400
He's made it past each of our cordons and is nearing the Golden Fried Tofu Statue.

101
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,020
We can't do this with sheer numbers alone.

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,970
That's all right... To reach the Golden Fried Tofu Statue, he'll have to pass several traps.

103
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,860
It'd be impossible for even the Fox to get through that.

104
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,390
There! On monitor 12!

105
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,700
Our fellow officers are being attacked!

106
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,420
Hey! The Fox is showing up on monitor 9! Who is that on number 10?

107
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,400
The Fox?!

108
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,670
That can't be! Another Fox?!

109
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,090
Take a look! On number 2, as well!

110
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,810
Hey! He's on number 5 and number 6, too!

111
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,170
The cameras are being destroyed one after another!

112
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,430
What in hell's name is going on?!

113
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,760
The camera in this room is the only one left!

114
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,430
How can this be? What the hell's going on?!

115
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,790
Maybe you're being tricked by the Fox.

116
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,260
W-Wait!

117
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,940
It's no use, Gin-san... We'll never catch up to him!

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,170
He's just cruising! He's totally playing games with us!

119
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,550
Play with us, will he?! I'll catch that guy and kill him no matter what!

120
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,090
It...hurts...

121
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,920
It feels like no matter how much we run, we're not moving forward!

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,440
There are times when you think you're moving forward, but you're actually losing ground.

123
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,380
In the end, it's okay just as long as at the moment you die, you've advanced at least one step forward.

124
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,240
Shut up! Hearing that when I'm tired makes me really angry! Die, you!

125
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,020
Calm down, Shinpachi! Don't waste your energy!

126
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,580
But this is strange-we really ought to be moving more than this!

127
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,480
What is this?!

128
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,760
The floor is moving backwards!

129
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,430
Cut it out! Give me back the effort I expended!

130
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,500
What'll we do?! We're not moving forward at all!

131
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,780
Oh, I give up.

132
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,630
Faster! Run faster!

133
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,270
We'll be skewered! Faster! The spikes are gaining on us!

134
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,210
Don't ask the impossible! My legs are so wobbly, they're like Bambi's when he was born!

135
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,680
[Note: Refers to Disney's Dumbo.]

136
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,680
I can't use my ears to fly, you know!

137
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,180
That's it! Run on the walls! Jump like Bambi!

138
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,990
Heaven...

139
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,720
give me strength!

140
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,390
Ow, ow, ow. My crotch is going to split! It's going to split!

141
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,230
Wha'tre you doing?!

142
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,130
Pull me out quickly! Pull me out!

143
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,010
Coin toss!

144
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,770
Grab on to me, everybody!

145
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,110
Kozenigata-san! You really can succeed if you try!

146
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,620
I'm tangled.

147
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,810
We can't grab hold of you!

148
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,050
What'll we do?

149
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,860
There!

150
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,390
Nice, Shinpachi!

151
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,660
Wait, this isn't working! Too many people! Go somewhere else!

152
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,410
Don't be so cold, Shinpachi-kun.

153
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,690
It's not going to hold! It's at its limit!

154
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,430
Boss is at his limit, too!

155
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,280
But I kinda like this...

156
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,950
Forget that idiot boss of yours!

157
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,140
This is bad! What do we do now? Another one's coming!

158
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,030
We're in trouble again...

159
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,220
It's old lady luck! We've got it made!

160
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,960
What's an old lady doing here?! Why is there an old lady?! Who slid her down here?!

161
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,680
But we're saved. I wonder where that old lady came from?

162
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:34,860
Dammit! Why do we have to carry an old lady we've never seen before?!

163
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,120
Give me a break! I'm at my limit! We're ignoring the next old lady who comes down!

164
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,260
Forget it! I'm done with old ladies!

165
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,370
Hey! Now it's an old man! What's going on?

166
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,770
Who is he?! Who's old man is he?! Ignore him!

167
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,400
Don't look! We can't carry any more!

168
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,660
Good-bye, dear. I love you.

169
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,550
Old man! We won't let you say good-bye!

170
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,210
She's right next to you! Your old lady's right next to you! Tell her what you said!

171
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,940
Hey, what's with this?! What kind of harassment is this?

172
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,910
We've got a family here! Who's passing them down?!

173
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,880
Treat your elders with respect, dummy!

174
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,660
Ack! Another person is coming!

175
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,290
Hey!

176
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,240
You're the son, right?

177
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,070
What's wrong with you! You should be looking after your father!

178
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,520
Gin-san, how did you know?

179
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,890
He looks just like his father around the corners of his eyes!

180
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:27,170
Father, Mother...about the inheritance. I've decided that I will take it all.

181
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,880
The others complained quite a bit, though.

182
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,260
He's talking about an inheritance when his father and mother are in a situation like this!

183
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,050
We can let this one be skewered, right? Go lay a nest egg, you bastard!

184
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,100
Three generations share the same eyes corners!

185
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,300
You have to live! No matter how evil you are, a child needs his parents!

186
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,210
It doesn't look good, Gin-san! It's almost on us!

187
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,770
You fool! This family's lives depend on us!

188
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,320
It's no use! We're going to die!

189
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,990
[Note: Wordplay on Harley Davidson.]

190
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,990
Arley...

191
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,870
Davidson!

192
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,970
Since ancient times, the fox has been revered as a deity of the fields; a servant of the gods of rice.

193
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,290
A Fox deity, if you will.

194
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:21,490
A statue of the fox's favorite food made of gold shows how popular I am in Edo.

195
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:31,490
But while people call me a god, it's interesting that others call me a monster that tricks people.

196
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,470
[Note: Tamamo-no-mae (Beautiful Fox Witch). Dakki (Fox demon). Houji was the concubine of the Ancient Chinese sovereign King You of Zhou.]

197
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,470
The Nine-tailed fox, Tamamo-no-mae, Dakki, Houji and a variety of other scary monsters.

198
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,110
Is the Fox a god, or a monster? And what does that make me?

199
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,870
Cut the crap, you lowlife!

200
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,590
You're neither a god, nor a monster. You're nothing but a filthy burglar.

201
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,480
We'll settle ten years of bad blood right here.

202
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,510
Fox. It's time to pay the piper. Give yourself up peacefully.

203
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:16,110
Mr. Kozenigata, I'm tired of hearing those same words for ten years.

204
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,440
You're a persistent man.

205
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,920
No matter how many times I give you the slip, you always show up again.

206
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,810
No matter how many times I knock you down, you crawl back up again.

207
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,460
Why don't you give up already?

208
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,130
Because I'm hard-boiled.

209
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,280
A hard-boiled egg doesn't crack easily.

210
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,560
And besides, I hate thieves.

211
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,180
When I was kid, thieves killed my entire family.

212
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,610
Evil thieves like you who wanted to get the job done fast.

213
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,950
I couldn't forgive people like that, so I took this job.

214
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,410
But then I met an odd thief.

215
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,790
He targeted only villains who took money from the weak.

216
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,040
He never spilled any blood and never used the money he stole for his own gain.

217
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,370
He gave every bit of it away.

218
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,370
He broke the law, but always had his own way of doing things.

219
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,060
Chogoro the Foxfire, the chivalrous thief.

220
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,570
Back then, I was at the very bottom. I don't know how many times he frustrated me to tears.

221
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:24,010
But as I pursued him time after time, I began to feel something other than hatred for him.

222
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,530
What I was constantly pursuing wasn't just the thief in you.

223
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,110
Fox...why'd you sink so low? Back then, you weren't...

224
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,500
Stop right there, Mister.

225
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,740
An officer shouldn't say such things to a thief.

226
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,020
And besides...never tell a thief he's "sunk low."

227
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,770
Thieves like me were low to begin with.

228
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,950
Fox...you...

229
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,000
Exactly.

230
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,910
No matter how much people make a fuss about being a chivalrous thief,

231
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,670
it doesn't change that fact that you're robbing and stealing.

232
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,790
No killing, no raping, no stealing from the poor?

233
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,590
A thief is a thief no matter how you try to sugarcoat it.

234
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,350
They're...

235
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,050
Eight...Foxes?

236
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,160
No...

237
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,700
If you include that one, there are nine. What the hell's going on here?

238
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,920
So it was your doing, after all, Chogoro.

239
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,190
Those advance warnings of crimes that we never recalled sending...we took them as invitations to us.

240
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:36,200
No, no... I retried from that line of work and was enjoying retired life.

241
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,530
But then recently, crimes one after another popped up that I had no recollection of committing.

242
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,490
It bothered me so much I couldn't sleep, so I woke up.

243
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,950
Fox, are you suggesting the recent heinous robberies that have caused a stir on the streets

244
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,530
weren't your doing, but rather...the work of these imposters?!

245
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,670
Unfortunately, we aren't imposters.

246
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,900
We are all successors of the name and skills of "Fox."

247
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,720
We are the Nine-Tails Gang of Thieves.

248
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,530
Once upon a time, during the period of warring states,

249
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,790
we were agents sent into enemy domains.

250
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,540
We were a group of professionals in the art of thievery, with origins dating back to the ninja.

251
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,760
We slash in the darkness of night, bringing chaos to the world.

252
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,130
So you come from the same roots as the ninja. Nasty...

253
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,510
In other words, you're the strongest, dumbest thieves around.

254
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,410
Chogoro, old comrade. We finally meet again.

255
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,650
It's been 30 years since you disappeared in Kyoto.

256
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,870
I never imagined people would be calling you a chivalrous thief.

257
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,230
You couldn't even kill a child and ran away. My how big you've become.

258
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:46,110
We figured if we destroyed the false image you'd built up in Edo, you'd come running.

259
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,890
We'll make you pay the price for your betrayal 30 years ago.

260
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,530
Betrayal? I don't know anything about that. That's crap.

261
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,750
I never once thought of you as my comrades.

262
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,400
Shut up, traitor!

263
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,590
Gentlemen!

264
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,550
The stairs! Hurry!

265
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,060
Gas!

266
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,920
A trap set to protect the Golden Fried Tofu!

267
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,920
This way, everyone! Hurry! Hurry before the next trap engages!

268
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,060
The stairs turned flat!

269
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,410
Oil!

270
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,250
I'm slipping!

271
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,970
If we fall covered with this much oil, we'll be burned in an instant!

272
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,570
It's hot...hot... Or should I say painful!

273
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,370
What? Survivors!

274
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,940
Shinpachi! Kagura! Go!

275
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,660
What's the matter with you?!

276
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,670
Got two of them!

277
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,660
Just like you planned!

278
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,190
Perfect. Per-

279
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,670
Uh-oh! Two. Behind you! Look out!

280
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,870
Run!

281
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,290
Don't worry about anything else-just ram them! Ram them!

282
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,630
Don't worry! I'll catch you!

283
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,400
Try to take them with you if you can!

284
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,900
Are you sure? Absolutely? Make absolutely sure you'll catch me!

285
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,900
You'll be fine! Hurry!

286
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,010
Okay! Here goes!

287
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,960
What was that?!

288
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
What good's it do to ram us?!

289
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,210
Gin-san! Haji-san! I'm falling! Kozenigata-san!

290
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,200
My comrades!

291
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,010
But the bad guys are near.

292
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,510
What the heck! Don't waver! My comrades come first!

293
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,130
Coin Toss!

294
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,730
Why?!

295
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,600
Why'd you ram into your comrades?!

296
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,750
What kind of decision is that?!

297
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,520
Well...because I was scared.

298
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,980
You ran away?!

299
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,180
I can't keep this up! It's no use...I'm...

300
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,280
Fox-san!

301
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,640
Grab my hand, quickly!

302
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,670
O-Okay!

303
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,830
Fox-san!!

304
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,960
Fox!

305
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,210
Did you forget the Nine-Tails were comprised of nine men?

306
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,820
Did you think we wouldn't have filled your spot after you left?

307
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,200
Sorry to inform you, but I've been following you; looking for an opening for quite some time.

308
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,710
I've been looking forward to the moment when I would thrust this blade into you.

309
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,810
That memory is still etched in my mind.

310
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,700
I watched from behind as you took the child and a box of 1000 gold coins

311
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,950
from the mansion we broke into,

312
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,740
set fire to mansion while the others were still inside, and then ran off.

313
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,620
Mother! Father!

314
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,380
Listen to me. Don't let go of this box of 1000 gold coins, no matter what happens.

315
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,060
As long as you have this, no one-not your relatives nor strangers-can do anything bad to you.

316
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,840
But you mustn't use the money all at once. Spend it a little bit at a time as small change.

317
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,660
Understand?

318
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,850
Don't give up. A man must be strong.

319
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,880
Live your life hard-boiled.

320
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
Farewell.

321
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,160
What the?!

322
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,580
Fox!

323
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,680
Fox-san!

324
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,040
Forgive me...Mister...for not telling you until now.

325
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,560
That wasn't very nice.

326
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,080
So I've been pursuing the man to whom I owe my life?

327
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,270
Yeah...

328
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,450
Your pursuit didn't bother me in the least.

329
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,580
You'd always miss catching me in the end.

330
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,340
Complaining to your foe every day.

331
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,950
Doesn't that make you a failure as an officer?

332
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,400
I see... No wonder I could never capture you.

333
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,200
You were...always watching over me.

334
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,120
Boss...You were never able to apprehend me in the end.

335
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,590
It was a total victory for me.

336
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,130
No, I won. I can bring you back alive.

337
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,360
Before you go to jail, you'll have to join me for some Camus.

338
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,590
Not Camus.

339
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,620
Shochu.

340
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,530
Later, not one fox's body was found in the aftermath of the fire.

341
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,720
Were they burned to ashes, or were none of them dead?

342
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,170
They were, after all, the elusive Foxes.

343
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,610
There was no way to know if he was alive or dead.

344
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,230
However, I did know one thing...

345
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,840
One more place...

346
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,020
I don't feel so good.

347
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,030
On these hard-boiled nights, I thirst for a drink.

348
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,130
There are wounds that a man can only heal with liquor...

349
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,540
Huh? Was there a bar here before?

350
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,130
It's not a bar. You've really lost it...

351
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,310
Welcome.

352
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Master... Camus, on the rocks.

353
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,330
Here you go. Shochu.

354
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,190
Not shochu. Call it Camus, Master.

355
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,230
Don't call me master. You can just call me Pops, sir.

356
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,250
Huh? That's...

357
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,960
That's right, I'm...the hard-boiled detective, Heiji Kozenigata.

358
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,520
Wh-Who are you...?

359
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,730
Hijikata's corpse makes 4016 bodies.

360
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,580
Hijikata the fool's corpse makes 4017 bodies.

361
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,950
Hijikata the dummy's body makes 4018 bodies.

362
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,470
Hijikata the moron's body makes 4019 bodies.

363
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,550
Hijikata the bastard's body makes 4020 bodies.

364
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,310
Hijikata the pile of shit's body makes...

365
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,500
Count sheep!

366
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,840
Huh? Morning already? I couldn't sleep at all, dammit.

367
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,520
Of course you can't sleep counting grotesque things like that!

368
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,750
Thank you. Did you come just to wake me up, body number 4021?

369
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,720
Who're you calling body 4021?!

370
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,810
Go wash your face and change right away.

371
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,410
There's someone to see you.

372
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,110
[Next episode... "It's Often Difficult to Sleep When You're Engrossed with Counting Sheep"]
