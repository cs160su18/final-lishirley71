This is the death match arena, Rengokukan.

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,530
We rampaged through it and broke everything.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,050
But it belonged to the behind-the-scenes Tendo sect, who also controls the Bakufu government.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,780
Will we be all right?

Here's the weather for today in Edo. We'll see a clear autumn sky all day.

00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:06,740
Since Autumn weather changes like a woman's heart, please don't blame me if it rains.

13
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,360
Today's worst misfortune is reserved for...

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,000
Virgos. Everything will go wrong today.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,990
Gee, what a downer to start the day.

16
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,960
Especially the ones with goatees who are brushing their teeth right now...

17
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,000
They will die today.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,040
What?!

19
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,840
The lucky color that will bring you fortune is red.

20
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,190
Plus the red will make the blood less obvious.

21
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,880
What kind of luck is that? There's nothing lucky about that!

22
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,980
Have a wonderful day!

23
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,380
There's no way I will!

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,130
That damn show! It's so stupid.

25
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,210
There's no way that could be true.

26
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:01,910
If all the Virgos disappeared, we'd be left with a savage society run by old men. Right, Sogo?

27
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:08,140
Here take this. I used this red loincloth as a kid. Don't worry, I washed it.

28
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,900
What do you mean, "don't worry"? Why would I worry?

29
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,020
Can you believe this guy, Toshi?

30
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,260
Take this. I used this red scarf a long time ago.

31
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,270
Hey, stop it. What...? What happened? Or rather, what will happen?

32
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,060
You effing Gorilla!!

33
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,000
Ma-Matsudaira!

34
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,920
Get up, you Gorilla dumbass! If you don't stand up in three seconds, I'll blow your brains out!

35
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,510
Say...

36
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,650
One...

37
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,910
What happened to two and three?!

38
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:04,570
I don't need those numbers. Number "one" is all a man needs to live.

39
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,130
But you just said you'd give me three seconds!

40
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,630
What was that?! Even if you're the chief of police, you can't just do anything you want!

41
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:20,140
What are you talking about? Because of you, this old man's...this old man's head will roll.

42
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,800
Huh?! What are you talking about?

43
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,780
When I picked you guys up off the street...how many years ago was that anyway?

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,820
Perhaps it was a mistake to force you to work under me.

45
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,120
I wish I could start over again. I wish I could start from scratch.

46
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,760
If it's possible, I'd like to start again, back when you were in your old man's jewels.

47
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,400
What do you mean?

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,590
I told you not to cause trouble.

49
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,390
I already knew you guys were morons,

50
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,750
but I never thought you'd get involved in the Rengokukan.

51
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,090
The ring of what? Look, I don't even wear rings!

52
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,850
Neither do I, moron! And I'm not talking about rings.

53
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,820
My goodness! I still have a mortgage to pay!

54
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,430
There'll be no money left, not with my daughter's overseas education or my wife's spa treatments!

55

What! The Tendo sect?!

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,890
I heard a rumor that the Tendo sect controls the Shogun and is the real power behind the Bakufu!

59
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,040
Don't talk so damn loud! And yeah, that's right!

60
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,280
They control the Shogun and are the real power behind the Bakufu!

61
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,650
You're the one who's loud! And you're making an assertion about the Tendo sect.

62
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,980
I'm saying that you were meddling in their territory!

63
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,620
What?! You say we mixed up with Tendo business?!

64
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,490
Hey, hey, you're so transparent.

65
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,160
I know you're pretending you don't know. How 'bout I shoot you, huh? Should I?

66
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,910
Th-They did this... While I was gone...

67
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,230
So, we were called in...to be punished?

68
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:17,320
I bet we're an eyesore for them, but I don't think it will come to that.

69
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,720
Doing anything to us publicly will be the same as admitting

70
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,030
they were involved with the Rengokukan.

71
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,940
What I would rather concern myself with is that

72
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,350
they called us over to the castle on a pretext, perhaps so they could

73
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,980
get the two of us together and then - Bam!

74
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,940
Shoot us from a hiding place.

75
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,260
Virgos...

76
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,340
are going to die today.

77
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,460
And, they'll say some Anti-Foreigner Faction did it.

78
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,100
I'm going home!

79
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,890
What are you doing?!

80
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,990
No! I don't want to die with an ugly old coot like you!

81
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,660
I want to die with my head on Otae-san's lap!

82
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Idiot! Dying is part of the Bushido code!

83
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,650
No way! I prefer more publicity than the Bushido code! I mean, I love it!

84
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,540
Listen! If we work together, we could reach the castle without dying.

85
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,190
If we can do that, we'll win! It's not like they'll call us in and kill us. We'll survive!

86
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,880
We'll survive?

87
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,780
Maybe...

88
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,020
Let me go home!

89
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,910
Calm down! Everyone dies, anyway.

90
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,890
The important thing is how you live your life!

91
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,890
No! I want to have my life full of joy and girls!

92
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,930
It all depends on your fortune. Believe in your fortune.

93
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,680
Fortune.

94
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,230
Hey old man... What's your sign?

95
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,470
Huh? Virgo.

96
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,120
What a disaster!

97
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,310
It's 100 percent certain that we're going to die! It's a death drive! It's hopeless!

98
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:50,350
Calm down! If you don't, I'll snag a booger from your big nose and shove it back up!

99
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,350
I wanna go home! No!

100
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,110
Shut up! I can't believe you're a Virgo!

101
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,350
You don't act like one at all!

102
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,010
You must've been born under the sign of the Yakuza!!

103
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,320
I don't want to hear that from you!

104
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,990
Why don't I shoot you into space right now?! You could be a new sign!! Gorilla Major!

105
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,850
Y-You two, please calm down...!

106
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,990
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look where you're going while you're driving!

107
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,410
Give me a break!

108
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,410
You're an assassin, aren't you?!

109
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,300
What?!

110
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,880
You're an assassin, right? Say it! I bet you're an assassin.

111
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,490
W-W-What are you talking about?! I'm...

112
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,460
Hey, you!

113
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,430
What are you thinking?!

114
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,090
Hey, let me drive now. From here on it's a war zone. You go home.

115
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,210
All...right...

116
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,940
Boss, what are you doing?! He looked like a normal man!

117
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,490
Idiot! He wore sunglasses. So he was an assassin.

118
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,720
Eh?!

119
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,850
Anyone who wears sunglasses is an assassin, nine times out of ten.

120
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,730
You're wearing them, too!

121
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,690
This is just between you and me...

122
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,140
You know Tama-san from "Go on, Sing," right?

123
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,730
He's also an assassin.

124
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,820
So is the world-famous Kurosawa, Madam Junko and Hama-Sho, detective of the shotgun.

125
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,010
Don't tell anyone this.

126
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,690
There's no way I could tell anyone that! It's just an old man's stupid imagination!

127
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,740
He's still alive!

128
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,010
Um... Excuse me.

129
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,130
I'm late because I dropped my glasses back there.

130
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,600
Who the heck are you?!

131
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,320
I don't know. If my glasses break, I won't be able to see anything, I can't even see what I mean.

132
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,360
Hey...you need to figure it out...

133
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,100
Oh! Are you the driver's pet? Like a gorilla or something? What kind?

134
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,120
Like that car, Gorilla Mark II?

135
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Oh, good boy.

136
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm a human.

137
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,580
Don't worry, she's on our side. Here, Sachan, you get one of these too.

138
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,240
She's my old friend.

139
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,450
She's a freelance killer, but she used to be an elite Oniwabanshu.

140
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,190
To kill an assassin...use an assassin!

141
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,190
Matsudaira-sama,

142
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,440
what's this? I can't see clearly.

143
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,200
Hey, watch out!

144
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,880
Oh? Is this a Jintan dispenser?

145
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,150
They're great for reducing sleepiness and preventing bad breath.

146
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,800
No, no! In fact, it stops your breath!

147
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,680
It's a weird shape. If I press here, will a Jintan come out?

148
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,630
Stop! I'll give you something better than a Jintan.

149
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,420
Stop! Don't touch me! I've already given my heart to another!

150
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
Geez! Why did this ditz have to come with us?

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,010
Shut up! You're ruining my concentration.

152
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,160
W-Watch out!

153
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,870
H-Hey! Did we hit something? Boss! You just hit something!! It went flying!!

154
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,450
Yeah, that was an assassin too.

155
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,140
You liar! You just made that up!

156
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,010
Anyone who makes a living from the misery of others is an assassin.

157
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,510
You, shut up!

158
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,110
...Who's this guy? Why is he ordering me around?

159
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,890
There's only one person in the world who can order me around or tie me up.

160
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,920
But how strange... I find I love to hear harsh words.

161
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,010
Just shut up! Please!

162
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,090
Now what? Now you are begging? You shifted your gear to reverse?

163
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,900
I can't keep up with you.

164
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,630
But I see you're trying.

165
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,180
I'm not trying. You've got the wrong idea.

166
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,370
Like a girl who learns how to be stylish when she hits puberty!

167
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,430
You hurt Elizabeth! I won't forgive you.

168
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,260
Just as I thought...you've come for me, assassin!

169
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,440
We're scraping the wall! Sparks! On both sides of the car!

170
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,620
Do you see my driving technique?

171
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,650
That's no technique! I felt like we were at a private death picnic!

172
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,540
Come on, shut up.

173
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,910
Hey! Watch out ahead!

174
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,410
Don't worry, I can drive like Schumacher!

175
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,680
That was close. Just as I expect from an assassin.

176
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,280
What? Where's the assassin?! That was clearly a one-car accident.

177
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,170
The kinder he is, the more he blames himself and the more he hurts himself.

178
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,770
What are you going to do now? We don't have any transportation.

179
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,900
That's...

180
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,230
It's an emergency. We should requisition that bicycle.

181
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,300
Wait! I have a bad feeling about that bicycle.

182
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,990
Punishment, right? I want to be punished.

183
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,180
Punishment!!

184
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,090
Cut it out, already!

185
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,150
What a mess!

186
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,840
Now we just have to reach the castle safely for the sake of the owners of this bicycle.

187
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,940
Why?

188
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,230
All of a sudden, I see nothing but darkness ahead.

189
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,350
Is this a reflection of my soul? Or a picture of my mind?

190
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,580
No! Sachan, don't melt into the darkness. Open up! I have to do it by myself.

191
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,630
There!

192
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,420
Right there!

193
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,970
It disappeared! My darkness disappeared!

194
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,210
I can't stand it. I should've gone home.

195
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,020
What the heck is that?

196
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,100
It's like a washed-up celebrity who thinks she's in Karuizawa.

197
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,940
A washed-up celebrity would be better.

198
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,030
I don't know what I should do about these downtrodden people who live above my bar.

199
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,610
They came up with so many excuses again today.

200
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,060
But now, I've reached the end of my patience.

201
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,750
That's not something for you to say.

202
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,470
Hey, Kondo.

203
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,720
Yes.

204
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,300
Can't you see? They're assassins.

205
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,510
What? No way!

206
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,760
You didn't know that? Look at their fearful aura. There's no doubt.

207
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,290
I can see it, too.

208
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,410
What?!

209
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,430
Those movements...

210
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,370
Only people who carry the weight of sadness on their shoulders do that.

211
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,020
It's the ultimate esoteric technique.

212
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,400
I can't see it! I don't know! What do you see, guys?!

213
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,020
Let's kill them before they kill us!

214
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Bicycles belong on the road!

215
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,420
All right.

216
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,520
Things like this just happen.

217
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,580
No way!

218
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,530
It's because I was really scared. I'm an old man who thought he would wet his pants.

219
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, your eyes are all teary.

220
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,330
There, there.

221
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,990
How many would you like, Amanto-san?

222
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,620
Jii, all of them. I'll buy everything.

223
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,640
You are a NEET, a loser and a parasite. You're awesome.

224
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,950
All right. All right.

225
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,510
I finally found you, assassin.

226
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,820
That's enough... I won't say anything else.

227
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,060
W-What are you doing?! I'm Prince Hata!

228
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,520
Huh? Baka?

229
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,880
Not baka, Hata! Ha-ta. Jii, do something!

230
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,030
Yes, sir.

231
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,770
Umm...

232
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,540
I'm sorry! Please just save me!

233
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,970
All right. But in exchange, can I take your car?

234
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,420
If you save me!

235
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,450
We don't have time. Hurry.

236
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,660
All right!

237
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,650
Why did you let those two go?

238
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,860
Because they were just small fries.

239
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,630
Hi, you're shopping here, too?

240
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,830
What a surprise to see you in this kind of place.

241
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,600
As I thought, you and I are destined to be together, Otae-san.

242
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,100
Oh, no. A gorilla escaped from the zoo.

243
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,400
I should call the National Hunting Association and have him shot.

244
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,210
Let's see...The number is..."animal smile extermination."

245
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,220
O-Otae-san! Are you kidding me? It's me, Isao! Your Isao!

246
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,950
Such a bad gorilla! He's threatening me! Stop acting so sassy toward humans!

247
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,820
I'll show you!

248
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:07,550
Today's worst misfortune is reserved for Virgos. You'll die today.

249
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,810
...will die today...

250
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,030
Sister! He's not a gorilla! He's Kondo-san! Not a gorilla!

251
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,950
Oh my, if it isn't Kondo-san.

252
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,080
It was always him, Sis.

253
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,960
I'll shoot you if you don't start driving by the time I count to ten.

254
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,360
Ten.

255
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,140
You even didn't count! I'm sure you didn't!

256
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,090
Almost.

257
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,930
Otae-san, what did you just say? How can you say something that bad so easily?

258
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,450
I know! This chuka-don is from Horaiken.

259
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,680
This Neapolitan sauce is from Kitchen Bambi.

260
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,710
And this miso soup is from Matoi Suchi. I noticed they've changed the broth.

261
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,420
You're amazing, Kagura-chan!

262
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,770
Call me "Ultimate Tongue."

263
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,220
Running out of gas?! I bet you're an assassin!

264
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,320
Yeah. He turned into a gorilla before we knew it.

265
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,800
B-Boss! Please calm down. It's my life's wish!

266
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,250
How many "life's wishes" do you have?!

267
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,130
It's my first! My first!

268
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,030
There!

269
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,010
That's it!

270
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,290
Whoa!

271
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,020
Roar!! Amazing gorilla power!!

272
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,370
Oh, no. He admitted he was a gorilla.

273
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,990
Well, it's better for him to realize who he is than never know at all.

274
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,810
By the way, how can you just relax?

275
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,130
You can't escape from me. Divine retribution!

276
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,960
Oh, my! What a giant jintan!

277
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,200
If it's big like this, it'll save the whole city from bad breath.

278
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,880
Whoa! A bomb!

279
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,310
Run! Hurry!

280
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,350
By the way, where're my glasses? My glasses...

281
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,610
Just throw it!

282
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,870
Here we go! Get down everyone!

283
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,390
Huh? Oh? You...

284
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,700
...Eh? What? My booger? Did my booger do that?!

285
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,580
It's time.

286
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,080
Chief of National Police, Katakuriko Matsudaira.

287
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,300
And Shinsengumi chief, Isao Kondo.

288
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,660
You summoned us?

289
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,680
Yes. Good.

290
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,530
Today, I've called you here because of the incident that occurred the other day.

291
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,170
I'd like to discuss the illegal fight arena, Rengokokan.

292
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,010
What happened to you?

293
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,560
Nothing. Just some trouble making doughnuts.

294
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,890
Got into another fight, again?

295
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,570
Samurai are simply irrepressible.

296
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,540
I've heard only thirty of your men crushed Rengokukan.

297
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:32,080
There're so many cowardly samurai these days, but you did an awesome job.

298
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,030
Yes...you were quite impressive.

299
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:41,650
It's thanks to you we have such a serene balance between Amanto and Earthlings.

300
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,480
Thank you...

301
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,600
But you'd better not get ahead of yourselves and be too eager for success.

302
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,000
I understand your sense of justice, but if you bite just anyone,

303
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,390
you might be biting the tail of a wolf instead of a dog.

304
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,730
Do you understand what I'm saying?

305
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,110
Piss off the big guys and they'll wipe you out.

306
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,430
If you want to have a long life, you'd better learn how to live smart.

307
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,910
We barely survived...

308
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,960
Hey, I wonder if we misunderstood their intentions from the beginning...

309
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,150
That was a really fierce fight. One of the top 5 death matches of my life.

310
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,560
Hey...I think if you hadn't been with me, I would've easily reached the castle.

311
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,630
Please make this the last time. I have a family.

312
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,080

Yeah...I understand.

I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble, Boss.

Oh, yeah. The horoscope...

320

Something black and shiny is in my room!
