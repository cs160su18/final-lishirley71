The land of the host.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,190
There was a time, long ago, when our town was called by that name.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,570
Those dream-filled Shinjuku skies upon which Japanese hosts once gazed on their dreams...

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,890
are now filled with words by hosts from foreign countries.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,860
However, there were two men.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,800
The enigmatic vagrant, Kintoki Sakata,

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,650
and the former number one host, Shinpachi Buttchin.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,130
The two of them still run in this corrupt night town.

Yes...

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,240
It was all this buttchin's fault.

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,250
The reason I couldn't become the number one host...

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,090
That would be this chin, which looked like a buttcrack.

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,190
I cursed fate for bringing me into this infernal world with such a chin,

17
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,940
and blamed everything on this world.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,160
But Kintoki said...

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,560
You, then...

I'm happy for you, Shinpachi.

What's wrong?

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,850
Take the bandages off already.

30
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,500
Well, I'm a little worried...

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,710
Wondering if I've actually been reborn...

32
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,500
H-How does my chin look?

33
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,040
Perfect.

[Note: Kintoki is talking like kids in Shibuya.]

Plastic surgery these days is crazy stuff.

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,380
Why don't you take a look yourself?

37
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,050
It's true...

38
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,530
I no longer have a buttchin.

Though the young master is out training,

Obviously.

This is a celebration of the birth of the young master of the famous Yagyu clan,

so this is only natural.

Celebrities from entertainment and political circles are all over the place!

This is the power of the Yagyu clan...

How will we cut the cake?

117
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,550
We'll end up with slices the size of little steak cubes.

118

Is this the time to be talking about that, Sis?!

But this isn't anything cozy like that!

123
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,090
You were invited as friends of the young master,

124

but under normal circumstances, people of your status would not be admitted.

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,550
Just stick to the script, keep your mouths shut, and stay in your seats.

126
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,100
Refrain from any actions that would be conspicuous or ruin the mood.

127
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,980
Do not shame the young master.

128
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,020
I'll go get the young master now.

129
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,880
Sis, we need to meet up with Gin-san and everyone else.

130
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,210
If we let them run around this place unsupervised, all hell will break loose.

131
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,920
You don't need to worry about that.

132
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,870
They know to behave appropriately for the situation.

133
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,700
Ah, they're over there.

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,390
See. They're sitting quietly in their seats.

135
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,140
You're right. That's a relief.

Hasegawa-san and Katsura-san.

You losers will never be able to catch up!

165
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,770
Because I'm an actor! A winner!

166
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,100
On the game board, sure.

167
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,930
Even if you're rich in the game,

168
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,030
don't forget that it doesn't change the fact

169
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,210
that you're unemployed in real life, dumbass.

170
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,890
You didn't have to mention that!

171
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,080
Can't you let me dream when we're playing a game?!

172
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,190
Shove it, DORK.

173
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,400
A person who hasn't worked a second in his entire life shouldn't get cocky.

174
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,420
What's that?!

175
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,440
At least I'm not a loser in both the game and real life, like you guys!

176
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,240
That's going too far!

177
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,260
Get down on your knees!

178
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,190
I'll cut you down!

179
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,280
What are you doing, Shinpachi-kun?!

180
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,340
I just became a popular actor!

181
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,730
Don't give me that.

182
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,240
I was wondering why you guys were so serious...

183
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,830
Why are you playing the Game of Life in this place?!

184
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,340
What are you talking about, Shinpachi?

185
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,850
The Game of Life is an essential part of celebrating birthdays.

186
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,580
Normally, everybody immediately engages in the unhealthy habit of playing video games,

187
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,170
but during a birthday party, the mother making the food is keeping a sharp watch.

188
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,750
So everybody gives up on video games

189
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,570
and pretends to be good children by playing board games like Life.

190
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,070
So they can eat good food!

191
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,350
This is the principle of the birthday party.

192
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,410
I don't give a damn about the worthless birthday knowledge you've assembled!

193
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,860
Shinpachi-kun, the food isn't the issue.

194
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,070
If you offend the mother,

195
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,200
there's a possibility that she won't buy Kyubei-kun a Nintendo game afterwards.

196
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,920
And our dreams of gathering at Kyubei-kun's place after school to play RBI Baseball will be shattered.

197
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,920
[Note: Popular baseball game from the 80s.]

198
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,140
I don't remember having that dream, ever!

199
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,450
And what's with your obsession with playing Nintendo?!

200
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,750
You've gone way back to being little kids!

201
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,980
[Note: Because Kyubei's mom is dead.]

202
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,980
The mom isn't even here!

203
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,020
And the sharp eyes staring at us belong to all the celebrities, not the mom!

204
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,560
This isn't like the birthday parties we held as children!

205
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,850
Get a clue!

206
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,480
Ew, what is that?

207
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,580
Are they acquaintances of Kyubei-dono?

208
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,070
No way...

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,770
Shunnosuke Oguri is staring right at us!

210
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,550
He's not even trying to hide it!

211
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,260
We're here as Kyubei-san's friends!

212
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,090
If we do anything weird, it'll shame Kyubei-san!

213
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,640
You don't need to worry.

214
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,860
Through the years, we've been to many birthday parties and eaten lots of food.

215
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,390
You could call us birthday party professionals...

216
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,210
Birthday Fighters.

217
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,210
[Note: Caption on the top looks like Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac title logo.]

218
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,640
You only go for the free food!

219
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,860
Birthday Fighters don't do anything to make the birthday boy or girl look bad.

220
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,630
Even if it's someone weak, who usually gets bullied at school,

221
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,460
you make them look good in front of their mother.

222
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,710
This is an absolute rule.

223
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,430
By doing that,

224
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,600
you earn the reputation of a person who makes birthday parties more fun.

225
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,120
That leads to invitations to more birthday parties.

226
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,680
So you must not mouth off to the mother.

227
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,710
Even if you enter the house and find that it smells like a restroom,

228
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,410
you must never mention that fact.

229
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,200
Because it'll affect their trust in you.

230
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,330
You won't have to worry if you leave it to us.

231
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,620
Relax.

232
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,630
Students from other schools have also been invited this time.

233
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,110
Pattern B-2.

234
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,710
Compute their data, stat.

235
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,410
Roger.

236
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,480
You're all idiots!

237
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,180
Your presence here is making Kyubei-san look bad!

238
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,620
You're the ones who smell like restrooms!

239
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,310
You don't have to do anything. There will still be plenty to eat.

240
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,980
This party is a buffet.

241
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:58,100
Once the party's started, you can eat all the food you want.

242
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,530
So behave...

243
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,360
Hey, what's with that tent?

244
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,490
Why is there a tent in that place?

245
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,830
That'll prevent us from getting food.

246
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,970
What is that?

247
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,100
Is there a mountain climber among the guests?

248
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,510
The party hasn't started yet?

249
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,400
Why are you acting like someone lined up for an overnight release?!

250
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,280
Why are you putting your body on the line for a buffet?!

251
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,700
I put a tent up to mark my place in line, not my body.

252
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,000
Stop trying to be funny! That pisses me off!

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,670
Just go back to your seat! This is embarrassing!

254
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,440
You don't have to try so hard. There will still be plenty to eat.

255
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,310
The people here aren't that greedy.

256
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,520
No way!

257
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,060
Look at all the people here!

258
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,270
My spring rolls will be all gone!

259
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,530
All gone!

260
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,990
I'm staying here forever!

261
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,990
I'll stay all spring if that's what it takes to eat all the spring rolls I want!

262
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,300
I'll give you all the spring rolls or fall rolls you want!

263
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,060
Please go back to your seat!

264
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,370
If you keep this up, they'll chase us out!

265
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:50,860
Come on!

266
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,720
Everybody's laughing at us!

267
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,260
See? Look.

268
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,640
Even Oguri-kun is looking...

269
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,110
Oguri-kun was getting in line!

270
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,820
He was definitely lined up like he thought it was okay to start eating!

271
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,900
Tsk.

272
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,820
This is bad.

273
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,870
Not only Kyubei-san, but now we've made Oguri-kun look bad, too!

274
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,760
Hello, birthday guests.

275
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,570
Sorry for the long wait.

276
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,620
The birthday girl has finally arrived.

277
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,990
What is it, Tojo?

278
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,560
What's going on?

279
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,210
Just go in already, young master.

280
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,380
Don't push me, fool.

281
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,570
What's going on...?

282
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,460
What's going on...?

283
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,310
Kyubei-san, happy birthday!

284
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,850
Th... This is...

285
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,740
Kyu-chan's all surprised.

286
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,600
Gin-san, we're supposed to sing together now.

287
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,370
Sing?

288
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,120
Here, here. This is it.

289
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,130
We can't stand out any further.

290
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,020
Let's try our best to sing along.

291
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,960
Happy birthday to you!

292
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,840
Happy birthday, dear Kyubei!

293
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,290
Happy birthday to you!

294
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,100
Happy birthday to you!

295
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,410
What was that...?

296
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,350
That was wretched.

297
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,410
Honestly, what is he thinking?

298
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,940
Huh? Why?

299
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,550
Why am I standing out?

300
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,030
I tried my best to sing along.

301
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,280
Go watch episode 17.

302
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,800
Go watch episode 17 again.

303
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,650
This is bad.

304
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,950
Tojo-san's slit eyes are wide open!

305
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,630
Staring over here without even blinking!

306
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,280
Happy birthday.

307
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,370
Happy birthday.

308
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,970
Th-Thank you.

309
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,430
Thank you.

310
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,530
Gin-san.

311
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,410
We're supposed to take a bouquet over to her now.

312
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,730
It says that there's a bouquet under each table,

313
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,020
so a representative from each table is supposed to take it to Kyubei-san.

314
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,500
A representative...

315
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,590
I suppose I have no choice.

316
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,530
I'll have to go.

317
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,400
For I am the only person here qualified to be the leader.

318
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,890
Hold it right there.

319
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,750
You always call me the leader.

320
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,890
The leader of the leader is the real leader.

321
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,300
Wait. Calm down, you two.

322
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,630
This isn't the time to be fighting amongst ourselves.

323
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,050
As the elder, I should...

324
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,810
No, I said I'm going.

325
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,500

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,550
Calm down, you two!

327
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,980
Everything will be settled if I go!

328
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,650
I can!

329
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,300
I am!

330
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,310
I will!

331
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,350
Ky-Kyu-chan, happy birthday.

332
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,640
Here.

333
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,730
Th-Thanks...

334
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,450
Ew, what's with that?

335
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,490
Some type of harassment?

336
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,680
Honestly, what is wrong with that group?

337
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,050
What did they come here for?

338
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,350
Gin-san! This is bad!

339
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,010
Tojo-san's eyes are going to shoot beams!

340
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,820
Very bad!

341
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,450
This will be very bad if we don't get our act together!

342
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:14,090
Um, I'm very surprised about all these people showing up so suddenly.

343
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm very grateful that everyone came here for me.

344
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:25,370
Okay. Then we'll do presents before we start eating.

345
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,180
Everyone with a present for the young master move forward.

346
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,440
Yes, yes! Yes!

347
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,740
Sis! This is our chance to redeem ourselves!

348
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,780
Let's take that cake to her!

349
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,120
As a present!

350
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,260
But they're all giving her incredible presents...

351
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,080
Well, this is a key to our company's car. We would love the young master to use it...

352
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,100
I'm kind of embarrassed to take such a small cake up there.

353
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,840
What are you talking about?

354
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,170
You had this cake made for Kyubei-san, right?

355
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,470
I'm sure she'll love it.

356
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,880
That's right.

357
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,630
Presents aren't about price.

358
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,390
They're about feelings.

360
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,310
Where are the feelings in your present?

361
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,140
Somewhere around the 32nd page.

362
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,370
How would I know that?!

363
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,340
Come on. Let's go, Sis.

364
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,960
It's bound to be better than this guy's present.

365
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,710
That was close, moron!

366
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,620
Poor people shouldn't be wandering around in a place where they don't belong!

369
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,030
Hold on.

370
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,880
You bumped into her on purpose.

371
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,100
Apologize.

372
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,800
Apologize to Sis!

What's that, little brat?

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,990
Stop it, Shin-chan.

What is it this time?

377
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,090

378

They're such a nuisance.

I, Ayumu Tojo, one of the four heavenly kings of Yagyu, will not permit

391
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,340
any further behavior that would besmirch the young master's honor.

392
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,500
That's right!

393
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,840

Make yourself scarce already!

396
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,880
I was talking to the people insulting the young master's friends.

You bastard!

399
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,630
How can you say that to the guests you invited to a birthday celebration?!

400
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,640
Those words will lead to the fall of the Yagyu clan!

401
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,330
Guests?

402
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,890
I don't recall inviting you.

403
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,950
The only people I've invited to this celebration

404
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,900
are the young master's friends.

405
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,020
The other people merely take the effort to show up every year.

406
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,700
Enticed by the sweet smell, I suppose.

407
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,940
Unfortunately, the young master, unlike her father, places friendship before money.

408
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,300
You won't be able to build your superficial relationships with the young master.

409
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,260
Bah! You've lost my interest!

410
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,450
Remember this well.

411
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,740
You won't get off lightly for embarrassing us like this.

412
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,670
This is the last time the renowned Yagyu clan will be getting on its high horse.

413
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,230
It'll fall into ruin without our backing.

414
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,920
Tojo-san.

415
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,150
I'm very sorry!

416
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,640
Everything's been ruined because you were defending us...

417
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,680
Not at all...

418
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,540
I wasn't defending you.

419
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,420
The renowned Yagyu clan has many connections.

420
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,450
There was a reason for mowing the lawn here.

421
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,590
It just so happened that some bugs happened to conveniently pop out as well.

422
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,350
You mean...

423
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:29,140
Indeed, I knew that you people would snap back without thinking.

424
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,940
You made the task so much simpler.

425
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,350
Now our lawn is all neat and tidy.

426
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,750
Tojo-san...

427
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,710
Were you using us?

428
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,860
Using us to instigate those people...!

429
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,680
Who knows?

430
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,070

Tojo, I don't mind you putting on airs,

433
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,830
but don't come crying when Father yells at you.

434
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,840
Nevertheless, you have my gratitude.

435
