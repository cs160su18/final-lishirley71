2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,140
Master...

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,410
How can you be alive?

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,640
Look, Tsukuyo.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,640
You will watch as one who
protects you vanishes.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,160
And a new enemy will be born here
to replace your King of Night.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,820
I, Jiraia!

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,830
By the time you notice

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,790
that you're caught in a spiderweb,

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,160
it's already too late.

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,590
Now, to finish you off.

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,120
With your death, the moon
will become whole again.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,500
Gaze at my beautiful moon
from the afterlife.

14
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,730
Gin...

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,340
Gin...

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,150
Gintoki...

17
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,980
["It's the Irresponsible One Who's
Scary When Pissed"]

18
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,760
Jiraia the Spider...

19
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,680
He is skilled at spinning threads.

20
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,080
And able to turn any place...

21
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,750
into his web to abuse and
destroy as he pleases.

22
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,970
There wasn't a better thief
or assassin around.

23
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,520
But that wasn't what made
him truly feared.

24
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,050
It was his devotion.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,020
Ninjas aren't like you samurai.

26
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,780
We don't carry any devotion
to our masters.

27
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,710
We only trust the skills we've developed.

28
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,570
We'll serve anyone who's willing
to pay for those skills.

29
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,830
We sell off our skills, like a craftsman.

30
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,600
It's no different for us
Oniwabanshu either.

31
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,540
On the surface, we're said to serve as
the Shogun's personal secret agents...

32
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:04,850
But to cut a long story short, that's only because
the Shogun offered us the highest price.

33
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,090
But he was different.

34
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,770
He was fanatically devoted
to the Shogun,

35
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,860
and that devotion was
his only motivation.

36
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,420
I don't mean the young
Shogun in charge now.

37
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,640
When the former Shogun still ruled,

38
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:26,380
he would sacrifice his own body to perform
any dirty job, any dangerous job.

39
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,310
He even burned his own
face to work undercover.

40
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,680
He abandoned his face, his name...

41
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,890
his very existence for the sake of being
able to change identities at will.

42
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,400
Sacrifice oneself for the country...

43
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,290
Yeah, it has a nice ring,

44
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,660
but a man who's focused on one thing

45
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,080
will find himself caught in the darkness
before he realizes it.

46
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,900
When the Amanto came
twenty years ago,

47
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,950
the Amanto hardliners wished to open relations
when in reality, they wanted to take over.

48
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,120
As you know, the Bakufu and Shogun
were terrified and cracked in no time.

49
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,890
But the same couldn't be said for the
team of specialists, the Oniwabanshu.

50
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,330
The hawks said that this was the
time to fight and show our skills.

51
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,780
The moderates said that we should accept
the decision from the higher-ups,

52
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,760
and we had a factional
dispute on our hands.

53
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,040
Naturally, for the Shogun, too scared to
fight, the hawks would be a nuisance.

54
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,330
A cruel order was delivered.

55
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,760
Every one of the hawks, down to the last
clan member, was erased from history.

56
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,070
And for the dirty job of killing his own comrades,
against armed and skilled men,

57
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,780
he was the only possible choice.

58
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,550
Your loyalty is wonderful to behold.

59
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,980
However, your position among the Oniwabanshu
is tarnished after killing your fellow comrades.

60
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,640
I don't mind. I have no comrades.

61
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,160
My web only has room
for me and my prey.

62
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,470
So they weren't your comrades,
but merely prey caught in your web?

63
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,110
My lord, that wasn't what I meant.

64
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,950
Spiders do not readily eat their prey.

65
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,070
I know.

66
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,450
They wait for their webbed prey to weaken until
it can no longer resist before they feast.

67
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,460
That would be how a normal
spider behaves.

68
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,760
I am different.

69
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,880
I do not allow my prey to realize
that it's been caught in my web.

70
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,600
I do not weaken it.

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,450
I feed it.

72
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,570
Feed them?

73
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,590
Like a loyal retainer...

74
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,420
Like a devoted teacher...

75
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,050
I sacrifice myself for my prey,

76
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,400
Feed it to fatten it up.

77
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,800
And once I have exhausted myself
and my prey is fattened up,

78
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,620
I finally feast.

79
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,980
That is when I'm filled with indescribable
emptiness and pleasure.

80
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,430
The more I offer to my prey,

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,290
the more beautiful my prey has become,

82
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,790
the more rich my prey tastes.

83
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,640
They were not my prey.

84
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,080
They were merely food.

85
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,390
The prey caught in my web right now

86
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,710
would be you, my lord.

87
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,060
It was over in an instant.

88
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,130
My old man couldn't even see it coming.

89
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,570
If the old man hadn't foresee the
danger and acted as a double,

90
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,400
history may have taken
a different direction.

91
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,590
Though I can't say if my old man was
protecting anything worthwhile.

92
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,670
Jiraia was surrounded by the Oniwaban,

93
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,080
and despite receiving critical injuries,
he managed to escape.

94
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,340
That was when my old man got his legs
jacked, and legs are what make a ninja.

95
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,740
He retired to teach the next generation.

96
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,740
Though he may have just gotten
sick of this dirty world.

97
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,890
Jiraia was the monster the Oniwaban failed
to eliminate and let loose into the world.

98
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,020
And as my dad's successor, it's my
duty to shoulder that responsibility.

99
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,710
Though I wasn't particularly concerned,
I did look around for him.

100
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,120
But now that I've actually seen
him, I've changed my mind.

101
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,180
I don't want to fight with that sicko.

102
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,170
Take my word for it.

103
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,390
You should give up as well.

104
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,170
His devotion is to his prey.

105
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,490
And right now, his twisted devotion
is focused towards his student.

106
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,450
Yo-Yoshiwara...

107
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,250
Yes, we're in Yoshiwara.

108
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,340
The place where the King
of Night once ruled.

109
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,060
The stage I've prepared for you
to watch everything unfold.

110
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,450
I shall reignite the flames
from four years ago.

111
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,840
This time, the flames won't be an illusion.

112
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,560
This time, I'll burn every last person
you depend on to ashes.

113
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,120
Return everything to zero.

114
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,020
When the moon once again
rise into the heavens,

115
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,830
I shall be the one to devour it.

116
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,350
Stop!!

117
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:29,240
He's willing to sacrifice anything for his prey,
for the sake of completing his creation.

118
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,400
Everything around his prey
will be used as food.

119
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,230
And when he destroys
the fruit of his labor,

120
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,330
he feels supreme pleasure.

121
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,070
If you stand around, you'll
also become food.

122
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,270
I won't be there to save you this time.

123
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,890
It's a fire!

124
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,790
Run for it!

125
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,590
Fires are starting all over the place!

126
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,080
Look! The fire...

127
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,970
What is this?! What's going on?!

128
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,850
Sorry. After saving you
and bringing you here,

129
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,020
it turns out that this was
part of his spiderweb.

130
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,790
I couldn't ask for any more.

131
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,620
Huh?

132
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,970
Wanna know the only way to survive
when caught in a spiderweb?

133
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,490
You eat off the spider.

134
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,680
Are you...

135
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,760
Gin-san!

136
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,970
What's going on?!

137
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,780
Does this have something to do with
the people who took Tsukky?

138
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,750
Gin-san, the members of Hyakka
are putting out the fires.

139
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,930
Mom was worried about your injuries
so she said that you should run away!

140
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,110
Thanks.

141
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,140
Shinpachi, Kagura, take care of the fires.

142
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,320
Listen up. You'd better not let anyone die.

143
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,940
If it gets real bad, you should all
ditch the town and run away.

144
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,140
What are you talking about, Gin-chan?

145
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,040
Where are you going in that shape?!

146
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,820
You're the one who needs to...

147
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,080
Gin-chan?

148
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,830
I don't like it.

149
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,220
I don't like it one damn bit!

150
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,060
I'll die before I let that son of a
bitch call himself her master!

151
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,860
Look, Tsukuyo.

152
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,900
Yoshiwara is burning.

153
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,860
The place you protect, the place
you belong is turning to ash.

154
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,050
This will be the last one.

155
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,600
A large quantity of explosives has been
placed at the end of this thread.

156
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,470
Once I light it, Yoshiwara will
be burned to the ground.

157
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,440
Stop!

158
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,110
Please stop this!

159
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,890
I love that look on your face.

160
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,340
Are you scared of being alone?

161
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,510
Do you care so much about yourself?

162
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Beyond, you will find that abandoning
your sense of self

163
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,640
will lead to true beauty and power.

164
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,680
This won't be the end.

165
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,600
You will begin anew from the ashes.

166
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,860
Jiraia!!

167
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,450
The threads snapped...?

168
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,610
Threads running in every direction
are snapping one after another.

169
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
This vibration...

170
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,400
Food that doesn't know
when to give up, huh?

171
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,440
They can no longer move freely
after being caught in my web.

172
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,340
And yet they still attempt to resist?

173
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,580
Shinpachi!

174
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,670
We're cutting down every last of these!

175
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,970
We can't let the fire spread any further!

176
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,020
We won't let anyone else hurt this town!

177
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,440
They've all suffered so much!

178
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,800
They've finally won back their own home!

179
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,150
Doesn't matter what comes!

180
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,640
Doesn't matter how often it comes!

181
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,820
We'll hold strong!

182
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,270
Don't underestimate the
saviors of Yoshiwara!

183
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,180
Team one will work on
putting out the fires.

184
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,950
Team two will help anyone
who didn't escape in time.

185
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,030
Team three will tear down buildings
to slow down the fire.

186
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,160
Listen carefully.

187
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,340
The Hyakka don't have enough
people to deal with this.

188
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,840
You should all do whatever you can.

189
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,290
We must protect our own town.

190
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,440
Yes, ma'am!

191
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,620
Lady Hinowa, have you heard anything
about Lady Tsukuyo...

192
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,560
She'll return.

193
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,160
I'm sure she will.

194
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,480
So we must protect the
place she will return to.

195
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,010
The place where she belongs.

196
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,640
Everyone...

197
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,240
A futile effort.

198
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,480
Struggle as they may,

199
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,800
this place is within my spiderweb.

200
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,150
It is impossible to escape
from the threads.

201
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,210
It is impossible to survive.

202
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,650
They're all doomed to become food.

203
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,080
You people...!

204
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,700
No!

205
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,920
The bandits are using the
fire as an opportunity to...!

206
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,910
Lady Hinowa!

207
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,760
Mom!

208
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,800
Kunai?

209
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,690
Oh, sorry about that.

210
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,850
I dropped my kunai.

211
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,710
I have no idea what's going on.

212
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,490
I didn't see a thing.

213
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,430
I've been reading JUMP the whole time.

214
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm obviously not lending a hand here.

215
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,460
Zenzo-san!

216
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,300
Hinowa-san, was it?

217
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,690
How much will you offer for my skills?

218
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,880
You come to Yoshiwara to sell yourself
instead of buying a woman?

219
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,530
Heh, I used to think that fuglies
were the only way to go,

220
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,760
but I guess hotties aren't that bad either.

221
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,600
Don't mind about us. Get back to work.

222
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,490
This VIP ticket won't be worth anything
if the place burns down.

223
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,310
That's reckless! There
are too many of them!

224
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,120
The bastard stole the big job.

225
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,770
I'll have to make do with this.

226
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,160
I'll show you how scary
a real ninja can be.

227
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,710
Pop out your eyeballs
and watch carefully.

228
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,590
My moves will be over in a instant.

229
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,440
Zenzo Hattori of the Marishiten...

230
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,580
has come to play!

231
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,700
So they cut of all my threads.

232
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,500
I thought that bugs with spunk
would serve as good food,

233
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,640
but I may have overdone it...

234
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,390
Jiraia, I beg of you...

235
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,250
Please stop this.

236
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,650
Please stop doing this.

237
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,480
It was... It was all my fault.

238
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,840
I'll leave this place.

239
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,720
I'll no longer rely on others.

240
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,170
I'll no longer get involved
with other people.

241
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,170
I'll live alone.

242
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,850
I'll live as you tell me to.

243
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,930
If that doesn't satisfy you,

244
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,950
you can kill me.

245
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,150
So please stop this.

246
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,900
Don't... hurt...

247
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,070
Don't hurt my precious friends any more.

248
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,130
I shall sacrifice my very existence
for my friends.

249
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,160
No!!

250
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,440
That's not what I wanted from you!

251
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,150
Why can't you understand?!

252
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,290
Why must your soul be so weak?!

253
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,340
Why can't you reach my strength?!

254
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,940
Why can't you become me?

255
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:53,270
Tsukuyo, do you know why I spent
so much time raising you?

256
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,870
So I could kill you with my own hands.

257
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,700
I devote myself to my webbed prey the way
a servant devotes himself to his master.

258
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,900
And then I feast when my prey has
become beautiful and succulent.

259
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,770
It's like dominoes.

260
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,100
The more effort put into a work,
the more beautiful it is,

261
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,770
the more emptiness and pleasure
you feel when you destroy it.

262
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,020
Desire which can never be quenched.

263
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,820
It only grows stronger
with each new prey.

264
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,230
Do you understand, Tsukuyo?

265
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,940
The answer I finally arrived at was you.

266
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,380
I want to kill myself.

267
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,290
The mere thought sends
shivers down my spine.

268
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,970
There could be nothing better.

269
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,210
What else could give a
greater sense of loss?

270
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,090
To accomplish this, I needed to create
an existence that could be me.

271
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,320
The embodiment of carnage with
a strong soul and strong body

272
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,640
who could stand alone
without relying on others.

273
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,430
I thought you could do it.

274
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,580
But I was wrong, apparently.

275
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,470
I didn't expect you to sink so low.

276
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,580
If I had known this would happen,

277
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,200
I would have killed you when
you were still beautiful.

278
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,200
Such a failure.

279
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,980
I can see that the deaths of your
friends won't be enough.

280
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,360
How do I make you become like me?

281
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,960
How do I make you become
as strong as me?

282
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,710
I'll flay the skin off of you.

283
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:35,600
No one will realize your existence if your
body becomes unrecognizable like mine.

284
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,150
Your friends won't recognize you.

285
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,810
You'll be alone in this world, just like me.

286
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,070
I'm sure you'll become as strong as I am.

287
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,740
I'm sure you'll become just like me...

288
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,800
Hey...

289
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,980
Get your hands off her.

290
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,600

of Kanagawa prefecture.

297
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,580
Hello, Mr. Ginpachi.

298
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,920
My name is Junpei Masuda.

299
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,450
I love GinTama.

307
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,020
You're probably better off

be his student, you know?
