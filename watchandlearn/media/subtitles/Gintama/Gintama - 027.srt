In the red corner! The housewife who junked her marriage and found her place on the battlefield.

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,810
The Demoness Haruna!!

00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,760
In the blue corner! This lady, a former popular singer-turned hitting star!

Jock itch!

Otsu-chan, go for it!

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,340
No, no. She'd better stop...

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,160
She's going in the wrong direction.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,540
Otsu-chan! Popular idol singer-turned fighter!

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,030
When a person says something like that, it's a warning sign.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,140
My favorite ramen shop said, "curry rice will be a new menu item."

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,420
After that, the shop had to close.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,260
What a bad example! That won't be the case for Otsu-chan. She'll keep singing!

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,120
I think there's a sign of misfortune on her face.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,170
Too bad she's not more naïve or stupid. Like you, Kagura.

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,420
What is a dream?

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,650
So painful to wait for...so terrible to be without...

20
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:07,450
and yet to battle your way toward it along that thorny road...

21

Take's a warrior's courage!!

22

What the?! There's an intruder in the ring! Who is she?

[This is a reference to famous Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki.]

24

My name is Antonio Kagura! I'm...um...Otsu-chan's stand-in! Uh-huh!

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,110
Come on!

26
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,060
Oh, no! Whatever happens, it's not my fault.

27

Not mine, either.

28

You need to discipline her better! That's why she's like that.

They say a  kid's personality is set by the age of 3.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,700
Haruna! Come on!

32

What a surprise. I didn't know you guys liked watching fighting sports.

37
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,480
I especially like seeing women fight.

38

When they make those gnarly faces and grab each other, I just bust up!

39
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,330
That's not fandom, that's sadism!

40
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,710
You shouldn't laugh at someone who's trying hard!

41
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,600
Someone like you, who interrupts a match shouldn't be allowed to watch fighting sports.

42
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,840
Stop saying that. It's obvious that you're interrupting the match.

43
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,120
By the way, do you have time to go somewhere?

I'll take you to a more entertaining show.

45

If you come with me, you'll see.

Hey, hey. What kind of place is this?

48
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,360
It's a meeting place for inhabitants of the underworld.

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
Ordinary people never get a chance to see this.

50
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,700
This is...

51
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,880
...an underground fighting arena?

This is the Rengokukan.

It's hard to believe...

How often do you get the chance to see a real fight?

59
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,560
And when you add gambling to it-damn, that's entertainment!

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,170
This is definitely a great show, huh?!

If I can't sleep tonight you'll pay!

62
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,570
Obviously, it's illegal. Okita-san, aren't you a government official?

63
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,770
That's why I can't do anything.

64
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,680
They're some shadowy, political figures behind it.

65
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,740
You mean government officials are involved?

66
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,680
One wrong step and it's goodbye Shinsengumi.

Let me tell you something: I'm not going to work for you.

69

That's funny. I thought you were a fellow human being.

I thought you hated this crap as much as I do.

71

Look over there.

72

Kidomaru is Rengokukan's strongest fighter.

Hey.

75
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,550
Don't worry. This is my personal favor. It has nothing to do with the Shinsengumi.

76
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,690
No one else knows about this place.

77
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,730
So, please don't tell Kondo-san and Hijikata-san.

78
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,030
Is he really here?

79
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,120
Yes. I saw him coming in.

80
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,810
I'm a bit surprised to learn that Okita-san is an earnest man.

81
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,510
He can't stand impropriety.

82

I hate that guy.

83
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,710
Despite his appearance, he's a direct subordinate, so we can expect a big reward from him.

84

It's not a money issue!

Idiot. How can buttocks look suspicious?

Damn it! My ass is splitting in two.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,590
Gin-san, calm down. It was always like that.

96
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,840
Still, you shouldn't have been peeking into another person's house.

Sorry, but we were looking for someone.

98

Mr. Priest, did you see a man with a scary demon mask walking around?

99

Demon? It sounds strange.

100

Are you saying you're Momotaro, the demon slayer?

101

I'm not interested in some petty demon.

102
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,280
My target is his boss.

103

Unless he has a lot of treasure, then that's a different story.

The only treasure this demon owns...

106

is those children over there.

Are you sure? You're having tea with a bloody demon.

116

It's hard to believe that someone who takes care of so many children could be a demon.

I was sent to jail and I waited for my head to roll.

But someone had their eye on me and paid to get me out.

Are you suggesting we'll end up as meat for the demon?

Well, it might be interesting.

132
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,740
A demon doesn't strike unless someone touches his treasure.

133
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,750
But he'll do anything to protect his children.

134
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,100
There's no way a demon would say something like that.

You look like a good father to me.

And you have regrets about what you did.

What's this?

160
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,680
Sorry, he found out everything.

161
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,550
No, I mean... What's this? Do you have something against mayonnaise?

162
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,420
It's the Katsudon Hijikata Special.

163
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,300
Nobody wants this kind of "special"!

164
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,720
Hey, waitress! One chocolate sundae!

165
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,740
Fine.  Eat your sugar until you die.

166
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,800
How is it, Sogo? Amazing?

167
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,170
Hijikata-san is amazing. He can turn Katsudon into dog food.

168
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,920
What's this? I wonder why I feel so defeated after buying your meals.

169
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,590
Oh, well. Let's get to the main issue.

170
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,700
I heard that Sogo inspired you into doing something... But forget about it all.

171
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,290
What? You sound like you know the whole story, don't you?

172
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,620
Are you really a big official?

173
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,570
Are you sure you're going to ignore a crime that's right under your nose?

174
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,640
We'll eventually take care of it.

175
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,900
Hey, if put your booger in Hijikata's Special! Apologize, dammit!

176
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,640
Listen, if someone gets unlucky, you're not the only one. All of us will get in trouble.

177
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,180
Hijikata-san, I wonder if you've already found the information.

178
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,780
Do you know those guys called the Tendo sect?

179
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,080
They turned the Shogun into a puppet and are remaking this country just the way they like it.

180
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,970
They hold the real power in this country.

181
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,940
That blood soaked arena is...

182
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,230
Tendo Sect's Playground.

183
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,970
Where's our star? Anybody seen Kidomaru?

184
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,170
Well... Lately, he keeps finding new excuses for not coming in.

185
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,960
It's time for him to retire. That's all right.

186
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,930
We've got someone new already lined up.

187
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,050
Hi, Detective Pasta. I bought the anpan for you.

188
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,060
Why did you call me "Pasta"? There's nothing like that related to me.

189
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,520
Your life is like pasta. From now on, call me Yama-san.

190
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,690
Yama-san?

191
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,890
My full name is Kagura Yamamoto.

192
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,060
Hey, you just can't dictate things on your own!

193
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,150
Anyway, how's our targets, Pasta?

194
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,150
Nothing's happening, Kagu...Yama-san.

195
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,090
Gin-san said he'd do something within a couple of days. Hey, where's Gin-san?

196
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,020
Our boss was caught by those creeps and can't do anything.

197
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,750
It's up to us, Pasta.

198
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,920
I wonder if he's under interrogation.

199
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,410
Interrogation reminds me of Katsudon... I'm getting sick of anpan.

200
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,460
I want to eat pasta...

201
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,150
Oh, my! That's why I'm detective Pasta.

202
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,480
You're growing up, Pasta. Watch my back.

203
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,740
Yes, Yama-san!

204
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,530
Excuse me. But your backs are wide open.

205
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,460
Calm down, Pasta! Capture him! Get him! Anpan's stuck in my throat!

206
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,390
Doshin-san, you...

207
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm leaving Edo...

208
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I don't know why you're watching me, but I'd like you to overlook this.

209
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,540
I know this is a lot to ask, but I don't want to kill anymore...

210
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,150
I don't know how many years it'll take, but...

211
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,010
I want to say with confidence that I'm their father.

212
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,270
Doshin-san...

213
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,010
Get out of here... Fast!

214
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,080
Our boss told us to watch out for you, but didn't give a reason...

215
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,840
I don't know what he's thinking.

216
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,020
So, we're doing whatever we like.

217
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,280
I don't know what's right and what's wrong,

218
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,210
but I'm sure Gin-san would do the same thing.

219
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,840
Thank you!

220
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,910
Kidomaru!

221
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,970
Don't let him get away!

222
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,090
Kill him!

223
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,810
Let's go, Pastaaa!

224
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,150
Yeah, Yama-san!

225
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,470
Sensei! Why are we in such a hurry?

226
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,920
Sensei!

227
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,310
Sensei, why are you crying?

228
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,330
I wish I could've met people like them earlier.

229
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,230
Don't kid yourself.

230
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,750
Did you really think you could run away from me?

231
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,500
Is he finished?

232
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,760
Even Kidomaru wasn't able to handle a real demon.

233
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,770
Now you're the new king of the Rengokukan.

234
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,580
Onijishi.

235
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,860
Hey, Sensei!

236
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,470
Where are you going?

237
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,610
We'll go anywhere with you.

238
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,620
Well...I will go anywhere as long as I'm with you guys.

239
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,620
But...It doesn't appear I can go any further.

240
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,880
Ah? What's the matter, Sensei?

241
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,160
Are you crying again?

242
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,120
Is it because you are so happy? You cry so easily!

243
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:27,170
Right... You're right... I'm happy...for so much.

244
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,130
Man, I hate rain.

245
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,600
It's not a good day to hear a tearjerker story.

246
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,310
I'm sorry, but I figured you should know.

247
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,060
Sorry, Gin-chan.

248
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,660
If only we'd stuck with him all the way...

249
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,630
It's not your fault. He was a killer.

250
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,170
I'm sure he was prepared to die that way.

251
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,860
Sorry, I got you mixed up in this crap.

252
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,740
Let's leave things where they are. Nothing good will come of getting deeper.

253
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,330
You guys! Didn't I tell you not to come here?

254
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,550
Brother... If we ask you, you'll do anything, right?

255
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,090
You're Odd Jobs, and will do anything we ask, right?

256
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,330
Please, avenge Sensei!

257
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,830
This is...

258
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,580
my treasure.

259
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,840
We don't have any money, but we'll give you our treasure.

260
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,530
So, please! Brother!

261
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,940
That's enough. Time to go home.

262
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,550
I already know...

263
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:48,820
Sensei did something bad somewhere. Is that why they killed him?

264
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,790
But he was our beloved father... A great father, you know!

265
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,160
Hey, kid...

266
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,560
Is this one of those Dokkiri-man stickers?

267
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,100
That's right. How did you know?

268
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,190
Why? I'll tell you why?

269
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,840
Because I'm a huge Dokkiri-man collector.

270
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,920
I'll do anything for this one.

271
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,780
It'll be too late if you tell me you want it back later.

272
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,010
Brother!

273
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,320
Wow!

274
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,440
Hey, wait!

275
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,380
Gin-chan, are you serious?

276
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,890
I knew you were a whimsical guy, but you're crazy if you do something like that.

277
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,600
They're really tough people to go up against...especially for a punk like you.

278
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,860
You're already dead.

279
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,900
I won't cause you any trouble. Get out of my way.

280
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,090
I don't care if you die. But you're not even trying to save yourself?

281
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,130
Even if I don't go, I'll die anyway.

282
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,690
I have an organ that's bigger than my heart.

283
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:55,250
It's invisible, but it's all that holds me up.

284
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,800
Because of it, I can stand up straight.

285
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,870
I can walk straight, even when I'm bleeding and dizzy.

286
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,160
If I run now, it'll tear in half.

287
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,200
My soul...will tear in half.

288
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,940
I'd rather my heart stopped than lost what's most important to me.

289
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:20,690
Even when I'm old and my spine is bent...my soul's got to be straight.

290
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,790
You're saying that you're going to die for your own aesthetic theory? That's romanticism.

291
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,140
What are you saying? I think all men are romantics.

292
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,920
So are women.

293
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,690
But is it too unbalanced?

294
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,360
What will happen if all men and all women become stupid?

295
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,370
Let's go find out.

296
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,500
H-Hey, you guys!

297
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,920
What's the matter with all these people?

298
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,540
Really... They're all crazy...

299
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,380
Are they risking their lives for something like this? That's stupid.

300
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,570
So true.

301
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,040
Hey, what are you doing?

302
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,990
I'm sorry, Hijikata-san.

303
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,750
I guess I'm just another idiot.

304
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,190
What incredible power! He's Onijishi from the Dakini clan!

305
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,260
No wonder he killed the strong Kidomaru so easily.

306
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,930
Even samurai are like babies against him.

307
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:22,210
But I think Kidomaru was pathetic. He should've heeled and let us keep him as a pet.

308
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,250
Is that...

309
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,940
Kidomaru?!

310
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,710
No way! He was...?!

311
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,350
This is interesting...

312
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,380
Kidomaru... He's rising from hell to get revenge.

313
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,960
Bastard... How did you get here? I could've sworn I killed you...the other day...

314
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,960
You're the one who killed me, huh?

315
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,980
I've been so pissed off that my soul can't find any rest!

316
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,630
What are you going to do about it?

317
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,750
This place is no longer your place.

318
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,350
This is my stage. Begone!

319
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,840
No, I will not.

320
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,590
The soul of a straight and true guy won't disappear, even if his body dies!

321
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,850
Hmm...all right then, as for your soul...

322
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,190
I'll destroy it!

323
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,540
It's over.

324
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,990
He did pretty well for a human.

325
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,780
Hey, big fella.

326
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,020
It'll take more than a blow like that...to break my soul!

327
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,360
Those eyes...

328
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,790
...are the real...

329
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,700
Those are the eyes of a true samurai!

330
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,470
Hey, you! How could you?!

331
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,200
You completely blew up our show!

332
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,710
Do you know what kind of place this is?

333
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,730
Who are you, anyway?

334
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,980
What?!

335
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,940
First!

336
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,750
Filthy blood suckers of humanity!!

337
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,810
Second!!

338
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,360
Soulless acts of evil!

339
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,750
Third...

340
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,980
Third...throbbing hot housewives!

341
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,420
No!

342
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,220
Gin-chan! Third is "Thirsting after Papa's milk," uh-huh.

343
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,840
No, no! Third, thieving demons of hell...

344
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,610
[Odd Jobs Gin-chan]

345
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,610
You are about to die! Odd Jobs Gin-chan is here!!

346
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,780
I've heard enough! Finish them off!

347
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,020
Don't blame me if you guys get killed.

348
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,890
You shouldn't have followed me here!

349
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,990
I can't die until I get my paycheck for this month!

350
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,030
Not only for this month, but also for last month!

351
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,640
We didn't have any clients last month!

352
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,120
Then we'll get some this time!

353
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,770
Wh...

354
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,430
Who are these guys?

355
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,870
Don't you understand?

356
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,110
This is what you call a battle of vengeance. Avenging a killer?

357
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,130
There's nothing to gain. I know that.

358
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:23,110
But if I don't do anything now, I won't be able to live with myself.

359
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,550
Y-You guys! You won't get away with this!

360
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,960
Do you know who is behind us?

361
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,590
Well, I have an idea.

362
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,290
What... This is...

363
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,890
The people behind you are...

364
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,020
...us, the Shinsengumi!

365
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,240
Wow, there are some really scary people behind you, all right.

366
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,940
Damn! It's the Bakufu's dogs!

367
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,820
Let's get out of here!

368
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,250
Tsk. Those monkeys were just fuel in the fire. That's all right.

369
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,390
At least it was entertaining.

370
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:06,390
So the biggest fish got away as usual. Bad guys always sleep well.

371
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,770
For that matter, why don't you sleep forever? You played us like cards.

372
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,640
That's why I came to help you out. Right, Hijikata-san?

373
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,660
I don't remember coming to help any of these bastards.

374
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,420
But if the Shinsengumi gets burned because of this, it'll be all your fault.

375
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,880
You all have to commit seppuku.

376
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,990
What?!

377
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,620
No way! It's impossible to do that unless we're under extremely high tension!

378
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,760
Don't worry. I'll be your second-and behead you if you don't have the nerve.

379
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,140
I sure hope my sword doesn't slip...

380
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,880
Eww, I think he likes me. How annoying!

381
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,600
I'm also telling you, Sogo.

382
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,870
Really?!

383
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,400
Well, it's time for us to go home.

384
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,650
What are you doing?

385
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,870
Oh? Well...

386
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,880
I guess I won't be needing this anymore.

387
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,240
And you don't need it either.

388
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,550
Laugh and let your face show-in heaven.

389
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:50,960
[Preview]

390
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,220
Hey, Gorilla!

391
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,820
Why did you get involved in Rengokukan?

392
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,510
Because of you guys, my head will roll!

393
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:56,410
The next episode: "Good Things Never Come in Twos (but Bad Things Do)."

394
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,600
[Katakuriko Matsudaira, Chief of National Police. He strikes fear in the hearts of the people and executives of the Shinsengumi.]

395
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,640
[Isao Kondo, Born on September 4th. Virgo. Today, his lucky color is red and his fortune is...]

396
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,490
Virgos, you'll die today.
