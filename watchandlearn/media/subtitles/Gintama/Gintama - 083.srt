I'm sorry.

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,360
I'm sorry to make you feel uncomfortable, Kyu-chan.

84
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,820
No problem. I'm not sure if I can handle this, but I'll give it a try.

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,330

I didn't go, Young Lord!

90
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,570
I'm telling you, I didn't pay 10,000 yen for a one-time course! Please don't hate me.

91
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,180
Don't worry. I've hated you all along.

92
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,620
But are you really okay with this, Kyu-chan?

93
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,080
You've lived as a man until now, and now you'll accompany men...

94
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,520
It'll be just like talking with my friends, right?

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,370
Well, a conversation might be all right, but there're guys who'll slap your ass.

96
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,420
Are you fine with that?

97
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,880
I'll be patient but somewhat ashamed. I've caused you guys a lot of trouble before.

98
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,160
So I want to help you as much as possible.

99
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,590
Kyu-chan...

100
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,540
Well, if you're sure it's all right...but don't push yourself.

101
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,780
Regardless of whether you're a man or a woman,

102
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,010
it's natural to feel uncomfortable when someone touches your ass.

103
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,540
If you touch Young Lord in such a friendly manner, you'll get tossed like that.

104
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,840
Young Lord likes young girls, but if some pathetic man touches her,

105
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,330
it makes her skin crawl and she does what she just did now.

106
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,620
Stop talking like that.

107
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,430
You react like that even when someone just touches your shoulder.

108
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,520
Do you think you can really have a match with a customer on the mat?

109
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,220
We already told you that's not it!

110
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,110
If I rub lotion all over my body, they won't be able to do anything to me. They can't beat me!

111
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,370
I'm saying that's all wrong. Why are you talking about lotion pro-wresting?

112
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,270
Please stop this already.

113

[Note: Hachikuro (Honey and Clover) is a TV show/anime.]

So, I'll become a hostess and protect Young Lord to the end!

118
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,140
Well, at this point, we somehow have three...

119
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,860
No, we don't. And I think one person is a complete mismatch.

120
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,840
Why does he have a towel wrapped around himself?

121
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,110
Why is he hiding his chest? That really pisses me off.

122
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,200
How many more people do you need?

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,850
I need at least three more.

124
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,220
If you count me in, we need only two more.

125
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,470
Three more... That'll be more work.

126
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,930
Hey, only two more.

127
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,240
Don't you know anyone? Anyone's all right, as long as she's good-looking.

128
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,720
Hey, listen to me. Or I'll cry.

129
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,990
I already talked to one girl, so it'll work.

130
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,870
Damn it. Forget it.

131
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,830
Ah, you already called her. That's great, Odd Jobs.

132
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,360
Hello there. I came here because I heard I could get free sake!

133
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,300
Did you hear what I said?!

134
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,030
She'll serve as a foil. In a group, someone like her is essential.

135
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,830
It's like SPEED, or Momusu. Whatever.

136
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:15,300
[Note: SPEED and Momusu (short for Morning Musume) are all-female J-pop groups.]

137
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,300
It's going completely haywire! Why are you wrapped in a towel, too?!

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,950
It's a service to TV viewers, of course.

139
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,540
For now, give me ten million yen as my performance fee!

140
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,050
Not only is she lacking in the looks department, but her personality is the worst.

141
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,800
Two more...

142
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,860
Hey! What?! From the ceiling?

143
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,630
Hey, you.

144
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,100
Stand up, Stalker. Starting today, you're a hostess, too.

145
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,700
Don't touch me!

146
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
I didn't!

147
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,430
I don't know anything about the Yagyu Arc or anything else.

148
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,360
But you left me alone for a long time, and I finally spotted you in the previous episode.

149
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,880
And now you're asking me to work as a hostess? That...

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,730
That...

151
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,640
...makes me so fired up.

152
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,930
You know exactly how to get me all excited!

153
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,460
Well... You're also a mismatch.

154
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,950
But that's okay, as long as you're good-looking.

155
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,920
Really, I don't know what kind of group this is, except that they all look like girls.

156
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,260
Fine. There're six here.

157
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,200
Oh? I only count five. We're one short.

158
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,280
Hey...

159
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,000
[Note: Parody of Oronamin-C, a carbonated beverage.]

160
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't drink. You can drink Koronamin-C, though.

161
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,510
Gin-chan...

162
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,010
Is this a monster house?!

163
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,290
Manager! Our guest has arrived.

164
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,310
Eh? Already? What should we do?

165
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,610
Everyone, hurry! Let's go greet him!

166
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,630
The glorious path of the hostesses has begun.

167
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,860
All right!

168
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,400
Can they handle it?

169
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,660
They'll be all right. They will...

170
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,940
Hey... Hurry and get up there.

171
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,990
The lotion's making me slip...

172
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,370
Hey! What are you doing?!

173
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,970
Before they even got to see any customers, they croaked on the job!

174
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,460
Come on! Hey! What was your reason for even coming here?!

175
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,810
You've doing nothing but cause trouble!

176
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,390
For now, let's clean up.

177
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,450
It looks unnatural to leave these guys on the floor.

178
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,820
Be careful! These guys are really slippery! Watch your step!

179
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,550
Ma-Manager!

180
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,320
Take...care of... my club...

181
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,510
Manager!!

182
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,560
Let's clean him up, too.

183
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,130
So fast! That was a quick change of heart!

184
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,970
What? I don't see many hostesses here tonight. We can't go crazy with this.

185
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,480
Don't worry. There'll be plenty more once we get there.

186
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,750
They're coming!

187
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,790
What should we do now? She said there'd be "plenty."

188
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,280
We've gotta do something right now!

189
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,250
Ah, what are you guys doing? Hurry up and come over here.

190
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,990
See, Matsudaira-san, everybody's waiting for you.

191
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,770
Hello! I'm Pako.

192
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,860
I'm Pachie.

193
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,060
So why are you guys wrapped in towels?!

194
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,670
We didn't have time to change!

195
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,490
Huh?

196
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,340
I see many new faces today. Are they all new?

197
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,160
[Hostess Club Smile]

198
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,030
Wh-Why...?!

199
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,570
Of all people, why are the Shinsengumi, the top people in the government, here?!

200
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,430
Ah, what are you guys doing?! I didn't know you were interested in such things...

201
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,420
This is bad. If they're our guests...we have to not only attend...

202
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,510
We can't walk with our heads held high... Gin-san! What should we do?!

203
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,250
Welcome!

204
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,010
Gin-san!

205
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,810
Don't tell me...! Does he think he's well disguised?

206
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,590
What is he trying to do with that?

207
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,600
Stick out your chin and mumble, Pachie. Mumble softly.

208
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,590
Mao Daichi said on TV that if you mumble, no one would recognize you.

209
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,590
[Note: Mao Daichi is a musical star actress.]

210
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,280
No way! They'll find out...

211
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,230
It's like putting on a black tank top and briefs and saying "I'm Death."

212
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,460
Kagura-chan, can you say something to this idiot?

213
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:03,300
[Note: Kagura is imitating Antonio Inoki, who is known for his turned-up chin.]

214
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,790
I'm Gurako. It's nice to meet you, bastard.

215
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,300
She already did it! She's mumbling! This girl...!

216
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,750
My hobby is shooting sixteen times with automatic fire.

217
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,290
Huh? Hey, Kyubei-san?

218
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,360
[Note: Star Soldier is a series of shoot'em up video games.]

219
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,940
My hobby is Star Soldier.

220
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,360
Hey, don't copy the way she speaks! What kind of hostess club is this?!

221
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,440
Is this a club where everyone mumbles?

222
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,080
I already told you that you completely misunderstood the situation!

223
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,450
Why is she doing Yasugibushi?

224
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,710
[Note: Yasugibushi is a local folk song of the Shimane prefecture.]

225
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,710
Hey, I see some good masochism here.

226
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,310
Hey, the sadist part of him awakened!

227
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,790
Hey, lady, I can put something much better than toothpicks up your nose.

228
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,790
Please get out of this club! I don't mind paying you for that!

229
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,560
[Don't get so cocky!
You white-assed brat.
Come back when your hair down there becomes a natural perm.
Then we'll talk.]

230
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,650
You're really something.

231
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,770
How could he even understand what she said?

232
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,350
Hey, Sogo, you'd better stop now.

233
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,790
We didn't come here today for fun.

234
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,000
Yo, what's up? There's no need to hesitate. Have some drinks.

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,540
No, we can't do that.

236
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,390
What? They didn't come here for drinks?

237
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,580
That's a relief! Huh? Hold on... Then why did they come?

238
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,350
Well, please enjoy your time here. We'll be outside standing guard...

239
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,900
...my Lord...

240
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,950
Gin-san, did you just hear him say, "my Lord"?

241
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,980
Yeah. No... but it can't be...

242
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,740
Hey, he just said "my Lord."

243
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,000
There's no way something like that could have happened.

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,950
Why would Shogun-sama come to a hostess club like this?

245
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,130
Well, please come in, my Lord.

246
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,130
Hey, you just called him "my Lord," too.

247
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,290
[Note: In Japanese the term uesama means "my lord" and is often written on receipts to show respect for the customer.]

248
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,170
My Lord is a very common name.

249
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,290
People always use that name on their receipt.

250
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,650
Well, but...

251
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,370
Did you just hear him wrong? Something like Uesugi-san?

252
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,960
Well, that's true. There's no way the Shogun would come here.

253
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,800
Yo, Sho-chan! Over here!

254
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,150
See. He's even called Sho-chan.

255
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,790
Sho-chan is a cute nickname.

256
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,840
But tell me your real name. I'm just curious.

257
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,940
[Note: Shogun is the shortened form of the title Seii Taishogun.]

258
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,350
The Seii Taishogun, Shigeshige Tokugawa.

259
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,940
Since I'm the Shogun, call me Sho-chan.

260
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,660
Come on. You like telling jokes, don't you? What do you do for a living?

261
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,240
I just said I'm the Seii Taishogun.

262
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,560
Wow! Tendon? You're such a funny man.

263
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,290
[Note: In Japanese comedy, saying the same joke twice is called a "Tendon."]

264
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,000
The second squad and third squad go way back!

265
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,840
Listen up. Don't let even a mouse through!

266
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,310
Even if a meteor falls from the sky...

267
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,630
...we'll protect our Lord!

268
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,280
But, really, this is a lot of work with our Lord here.

269
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,860
The Shogun is being schooled on how to have a great night life.

270
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,500
Every time he does that, we're the ones who have to guard him.

271
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,380
I hope he understands how we feel.

272
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,380
Our Lord is always cooped up in his castle,

273
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,360
so our boss wants him to breathe some fresh air.

274
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,400
Ever since our Lord's father passed away, our boss has been his substitute father.

275
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,860
Where on earth...

276
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,890
...is there a father who takes his son to a hostess club?

277
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,340
Well, he's more a bad influence than a father.

278
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,450
A man needs only one bad influence rather than thousands of followers.

279
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,150
Therefore, Toshi... Why don't we go in and have some drinks with Otae-san?

280
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,750
I don't need that kind of bad influence.

281
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,680
He's the real one! He's every inch the Seii Taishogun!

282
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,060
What we should do?!

283
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,820
Don't lose your cool! Calm down! For now, let's get his autograph.

284
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,330
Ah, we don't have a square card! Can we use this mat? It'll work, right?

285
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,370
You're the one who needs to calm down!

286
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,920
There's no way we can give this slippery mat to the Shogun!

287
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,620
Calm down and listen, Pachie!

288
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,920
If we handle this job, we'll get big money!

289
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,020
But, on the other hand, there'll be high risk, too!

290
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,350
You know, if we do anything careless, we may lose our heads!

291
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,290
I just said calm down. Are you only after the money?!

292
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,240
Here we go. Another cup of sake.

293
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,860
Fortunately, those dull girls don't realize the truth.

294
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,240
Don't say anything about the Shogun.

295
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,700
It'll upset them and we'll fail. We need to calm down, and-

296
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,130
Hey, you, the mumbling woman, come over here!

297
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,000
What's wrong with the mumbling girl?

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,350
A woman with a little secret is the best!

299
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,170
Hey, calm down! Calm down!

300
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,550
Hey, you over there with the pigtails, the person who looks like she's from a school that's going to close!

301
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,020
You come here, too!

302
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,640
Don't underestimate pigtails!

303
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,680
At first glance, she looks a bit clunky, and nobody pays attention to her in class.

304
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,100
But with a little polish she'll become pretty. A man likes that kind of woman!

305
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,620
Calm down, Shinpachi!

306
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,760
Even if you were polished, you'd be like the bell of a rusty bike!

307
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,300
Hmm... Looks like we have enough people now.

308
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,230
Be patient.

309
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,670
You, too.

310
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,800
Well, I'm getting drunk, so it's about time to...

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,680
...start the Shogun-sama game!

312
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,940
Shogun-sama game?

313
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,530
Let me explain the rules.

314
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,320
The Shogun-sama game

315
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,340
starts with writing numbers and the name "Shogun" on wooden chopsticks.

316
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,320
The one who draws the stick with "Shogun" on it

317
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,170
can give dirty commands to another person, who can't refuse.

318
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,960
It's a game for adults only. Or it's like a king game.

319
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,950
Ah-ha, Matsudaira-san,

320
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,050
you're using this game to cover up the fact that you're doing something dirty, right?

321
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,850
No, no. I'll just be a facilitator this time. Well, young people can have fun.

322
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,030
Let's see who gets the Shogun-sama stick!

323
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,360
Well... I mean...

324
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,880
Shogun-sama is right here...

325
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,390
All right, let's begin. Draw a stick. First come, first-served...

326
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,570
Really... They have no intention of entertaining the customers.

327
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,840
They're just focused on their own desires.

328
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,620
But this is a big chance, Pachie.

329
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,190
If we let the real Shogun become the Shogun in the game, he'll thoroughly enjoy it.

330
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,750
I know, Pako-san.

331
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,740
Oh, my!

332
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,070
Hold on a second. The sticks are a real mess now.

333
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,790
Oh, well, I'll hold the sticks, so everyone get over here when I give the signal.

334
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,680
Start!

335
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,900
Shogun, pick the right one!

336
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,970
What?!

337
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,040
Tsk. Too fast!

338
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,020
The Shogun stick... Who has it?

339
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,900
Ah, I'm the Shogun!

340
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,880
Pako-san...

341
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,400
He's great! He sensed everyone's movements and picked the Shogun stick.

342
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,990
But if Pako-san is the Shogun, it's not going to work.

343
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,020
Let's see... the person who picked number 4, strip down to your underwear.

344
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,410
I see! This order will make everyone visually entertained, not just Shogun-sama.

345
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,460
What a great idea!

346
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,130
Shogun-sama was the one?!

347
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,460
This is bad. Why did he draw number 4, stupid Lord?!

348
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,100
This is really bad. He's definitely upset.

349
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,600
Please forgive me. I didn't mean to do it.

350
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,280
And on this day he happens to be wearing briefs. That just adds to his shame!

351
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,220
The Shogun family traditionally wears manly briefs.

352
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,650
This is really bad. He heard me. And he even said that he wears those every day!

353
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,960
Anyway, we have to get him dressed and out of that underwear situation. Or we'll be exiled.

354
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,780
Either you or me must get the Shogun stick and-

355
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,660
Whoa! I lost again.

356
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,660
Hey! Why did you start the second round on your own?!

357
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,200
I got it! I'm the Shogun!

358
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,390
These guys are just enjoying the game!

359
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,770
They don't care about the Shogun!

360
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,490
Well, let me see...

361
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,930
Then my order is...

362
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,950
Number 3, give the person who looks the coldest your kimono.

363
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,570
...Sis...

364
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,460
Sis! You're great! You really care about the customers first!

365
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,440
You're a professional! You're a true pro!

366
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,990
Shogun, again?!

367
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,880
This is bad. It's been blurred out!

368
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,080
And the Shogun's not a Shogun. It's like a foot soldier's size!

369
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,190
The Shogun family has traditionally been the size of a foot soldier.

370
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,060
Damn it. He heard me. We'll definitely be beheaded now.

371
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,680
Pachie, let's give up on all the kimonos whatsoever.

372
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,130
As we can see, there's nothing to lose.

373
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,800
It can't get any worse than this. Things can only get better.

374
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,850
Hey...

375
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,380
This is really stinky, so can I take it off?

376
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,580
There is something worse...

377
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,810
Oh-oh! Shogun has grown teary-eyed. Is he crying? He's crying, isn't he?

378
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,110
Hey, hey, hey! This is bad! It's like he's getting bullied!

379
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,600
I remember somebody who cried just like that in my class!

380
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,320
This game is getting really bad...

381
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,970
Those girls...!

382
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,200
Finally, my time has come. I have only one desire...for Gin-san to have se-

383
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,170
Use the numbers, fool!

384
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,410
You hurt me, Otae-san.

385
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,320
Do you think you can get away with doing that to the Shogun?

386
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,250
I'll remember this!

387
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,650
Try it if you can!

388
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,120
Boxers... Number 5, go buy some boxers.

389
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,980
Sachan-san... You... could it be... You're doing this for the Shogun?

390
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,830
As we thought...the Shogun, again!

391
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,030
Our Lord... I wonder if he's having a great time right now.

392
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,480
Who knows...

393
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,670
I hope he didn't fall in love with Otae-san.

394

Ah, my Lord.

Damn it. Things are getting even worse.

I had fun.

415

Do you know the origin of the word "hard-boiled?"

416
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,720
It comes from hard-boiled eggs. Right...
