Uh, is that Sadaharu clamped onto Sakata? Are you all right?

162
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,750
I'm fine. Sadaharu is a bright pup. This is his playful bite.

163
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,350
But you're bleeding...

164
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,600
Gin, the judges are getting worried.

165
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,020
Stop the bleeding! Stop it!

166
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,410
Stop Sadaharu, Kagura!

167
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,270
He won't listen to anybody but you, Kagura.

168
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,630
Right.

169
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,870
Sadaharu! Stop! No snacks for you tonight!

170
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,600
Are you ignoring me, too?!

171
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:39,130
Come on! Pull yourselves together. We can't get to the finals like this!

172
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,500
That so? The judges can't take their eyes off of me.

173
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,120
Of course they can't take their eyes off of you. Look in the mirror!

174
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,670
You're both stiff. Use the entire stage!

175
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,630
Move your bodies more!

176
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,600
You're the one who looks like a robot!

177
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,480
It would seem the owners are more unusual than their pet.

178
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,090
Let's cut to commercial.

179
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,140
All right! Let's welcome our next team.

180
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,880
Our next unusual pet is...

181
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,500
space creature Elizabeth, and her owner, Space Captain Katsura!

182
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,330
What's he up to?

183
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,560
A wanted man is disguising himself to get on TV.

184
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,390
He seems to really love his pet.

185
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,530
He likes his pet, but he's also in love with that costume.

186
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,250
Katsura, what exactly is a Space Captain?

187
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,600
A captain in space.

188
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,220
You'll be facing Sadaharu over there. The winner advances to the finals.

189
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,040
How confident are you?

190
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,810
That's nothing but a huge dog.

191
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,560
My dog Taro back home is about that size.

192
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
What's that, Zura?!

193
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,400
Stuff like that monster penguin of yours comes out of the faucet when I turn on the spigot at home!

194
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,430
Too obvious! Stop making up such transparent lies!

195
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,560
It's time to appeal to our judges!

196
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,890
Come on and give it up.

197
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,000
It's time for the first round.

198
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,460
Show our judges your pet's most attractive features!

199
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,650
As we always mention, our judges assign scores according to their own arbitrary judgment.

200
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,040
All right, let's begin with the Sakata family. This is your time to shine. Go!

201
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,300
Okay! Let's show them the results of your special training!

202
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,270
Damn right you will.

203
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,840
We can't let this past week of bloody effort go to waste.

204
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,290
Spraying blood around isn't really work, though.

205
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,400
Are you ready, Gin? Shinpachi?

206
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,420
Ready, Sadaharu?

207
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,510
This will work. Trust in yourself.

208
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,950
Mom believes in you, son.

209
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,770
Who are you talking to?

210
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,410
Okay, Sadaharu! Go!

211
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,780
Sadaharu! Your paw!

212
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,780
Now the other one!

213
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,860
The final trick! Sit!

214
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay! Perfect!

215
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,390
Hmph. It's no different than the last time!

216
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,220
As if force and blood are all it takes to call something a trick.

217
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,520
My Elizabeth doesn't do such lowly tricks.

218
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,470
Now, it's Elizabeth's time to appeal to our judges.

219
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,600
Go ahead!

220
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,390
Watch this!

221
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,680
Paper and brushes?! What is she going to do?!

222
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,610
Yes...

223
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,690
Show them, Elizabeth!

224
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,930
Oh! Elizabeth's drawing like crazy all of a sudden!

225
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,250
Wh-What's that...?

226
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,840
It's a wonderful painting!

227
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,680
It's as though a human painted it!

228
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,630
Hey, announcer, what kind of way is that to describe it?!

229
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,810
That's being rude to Elizabeth.

230
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,190
Uh... Forgive me.

231
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,040
Hmph. I could paint better than that!

232
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,080
No, that's not the point.

233
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,750
It's all right. We win on impact. Don't worry.

234
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,720
We only won on quantity of blood.

235
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,450
This is fine work...

236
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,840
I think this will achieve quite a high score.

237
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,840
All right, judges, let's see your scores.

238
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,010
My! We've got quite a point spread from the very start!

239
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,860
Will it be possible to turn the tables?!

240
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,180
That's what I'd like to know.

241
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,380
Hmph. The match is over.

242
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,140
We'll now move on to round two.

243
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,230
I will toss this fried chicken bone. The first pet that fetches this bone back to its master will be the winner.

244
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,330
Feel free to yell commands at your pet. If you win this event, you will receive 30,000 points.

245
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,320
Put your heart and soul into this challenge!

246
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,050
Hey, announcer. Then what was the purpose of the first round?

247
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,400
Well, as a show, we needed to build the excitement...

248
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,170
You don't need to do that! Change the rules right now!

249
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,140
Hey Zura. Don't argue with the producers!

250
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,090
If you've got a problem with it, go on home!

251
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,970
What?!

252
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,690
Now, now.

253
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,540
Anyhow, this will determine the winner.

254
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,570
Both of you, good luck.

255
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,760
Why don't we just skip the boring contest and duke it out like men?

256
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,230
I was hoping you'd say that!

257
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,780
No, this isn't your fight! Cut it out, damn you!

258
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,660
Hey, maybe we can win this, after all!

259
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,580
Elizabeth looks pretty slow on her feet, doesn't she, Kagura?

260
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,690
[Shinpachi, say something funny.]

261
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,700
Why don't you go home?

262
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,560
Okay, here we go!

263
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,170
Ready...

264
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,690
Get set...

265
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,690
Go!

266
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,750
What do we have here?!

267
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,590
Idiot! The other way!

268
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,470
Sadaharu ran the wrong way, and is chasing after his owner!

269
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,600
Stop! It's the other way, I'm telling you!

270
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,340
Uh-oh! Sakata charged into the judges' table!

271
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,490
Stop that! Don't destroy the set!

272
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,080
As for Elizabeth...

273
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,910
What speed!

274
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,560
Elizabeth looked to be at a disadvantage, but she's running at awesome speed!

275
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,100
Huh? Are my eyes playing tricks on me?!

276
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,330
For an instant, I saw what looked like an old man's leg.

277
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,160
There it is again! Hey, old man!

278
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,100
Enough with your false accusations!

279
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,710
Elizabeth trained hard just for today.

280
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,890
Don't call her an old man or things like that!

281
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,550
Uh... Sorry.

282
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,900
Gin!

283
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,870
If you're going to run away, run away toward the bone!

284
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,050
Kagura! Call Sadaharu back!

285
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,860
[I'm feeling a bit hungry.]

286
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,460
Who're you talking to...?

287
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,440
Don't come this way! Stop, you stupid dog!

288
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,330
Look out!

289
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,360
Out of the way!

290
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm not moving. As Annual Weird Cosmic Pet Grand Prix champion and its owner...

291
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,540
I can't run from here! I'll take you on!

292
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,700
Miss Garter Belt! Execute Plan C!

293
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,760
Oh! Our champion is defeated so easily!

294
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,250
How will we hold our finals?

295
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,530
Sadaharu bites Sakata!

296
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,660
Just what on earth is your relationship, anyway?!

297
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,400
Gin! What'll we do? We're about to lose!

298
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,130
Sadaharu, move!

299
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,860
Oh look, look. Want this?

300
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,860
Come one, come on, put me down, you damn brat!

301
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,060
Go!

302
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,100
Go?!

303
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,950
It appears Sakata is using himself as bait

304
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,330
to lure Sadaharu!

305
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:24,590
Sadaharu is charging like a rhino! But Elizabeth has nearly reached the bone.

306
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,570
No fabulous prize for you.

307
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,540
Let go of Elizabeth!

308
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,070
The fabulous prize belongs to me and Elizabeth.

309
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,200
After all is said and done, you love your master, don't you?

310
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,550
But if you bite any harder,

311
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,010
I'll snap your master's neck.

312
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,750
What are you gonna do?

313
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,820
He's not gonna do anything! He doesn't understand you!

314
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,720
You bastards! You changed the format of the contest!

315
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,080
Please, if you don't follow the rules, we can't broadcast this!

316
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,230
Who cares about your broadcast!

317
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,500
Oh, the hell with it.

318
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,070
I'm pooped.

319
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,710
I'm going home. Can you just get off me?

320
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,040
What's going on?!

321
