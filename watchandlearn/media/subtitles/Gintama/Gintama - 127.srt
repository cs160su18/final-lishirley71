00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,420
What's with this pose!

3
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,130
But he's pretty cute.

4
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,480
And he's about your age,
Sis. That's terrific.

5
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,020
Urara... I have to apologize to you.

6
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,640
A-Actually, when I sent that letter,
I put your picture inside the bottle.

7
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,990
What? My picture? Why?

8
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,310
Because you're so cute.

9
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:12,390
I thought if anyone saw your
picture, they'd be sure to reply.

10
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,670
I'm so sorry!

11
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,580
Why'd you do such a thing? Why
didn't you include your own photo?

12
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,510
I couldn't! No one would take me seriously.

13
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,890
The reply came all because of your picture.

14
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,270
Be more confident! You're
pretty, Sis! And so am I.

15
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,020
Okay then, if I've made a
new friend, I'll forgive you.

16
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,250
You're going to change
this time, right, Sis?

17
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,130
Take it slow, but do your best, Sis.

["Sometimes You Must
Meet To Understand"]

19
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,860
I didn't think this letter would reach
anyone, so I'm very happy.

20
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,260
I'd like to get to know
you better, Shinpachi.

21
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,990
Hey, you did it. She wants
to get to know you better.

22
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,850
She's totally into this. So what'll you do?

23
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,130
Will you tell her everything?

24
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,610
But, Gin... The picture I sent to her...

25
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,420
Maybe it's not me she wants
to get to know, but Okita.

26
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,140
If I said, "This is Shinpachi Shimura,"

27
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,040
wouldn't anyone looking at the photo
assume that I meant Okita?

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,640
Don't worry. You're in the
picture. And you look good.

29
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,400
But half of me is out of the frame!
I'm the one being slain!

30
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,640
If you want to be considered the lover
here, then that's the perfect pose.

31
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,890
We didn't tell any lies. And if she misinterprets
things, that's not our fault.

32
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,140
Anyone looking at this
would misinterpret it!

33
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,920
But we've passed the first hurdle
in getting her to reply.

34
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,630
So naive.

35
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,790
The first gate? That's way off.

36
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,810
You guys aren't even in front of the gate.

37
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,080
I don't need to hear that from someone
who can't even get through the gate!

38
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,380
Don't say anything, Shinpachi.

39
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,920
I know pretty much what's been
happening these past few days.

40
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,680
How do you know?! Okita
was here looking for you!

41
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,210
How long have you been there?!

42
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,150
If it's matters of the heart, why didn't
you come to me, Kondo the expert?!

43
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,860
You're the expert of harassment!

44
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,090
Besides, I've never seen
a dirtier expert at love!

45
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,630
Right! To capture love, you get
down and dirty without giving up!

46
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,350
Give it up! Please, I'm
begging you! Give it up!

47
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,690
Letters, huh? Brings back memories.

48
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,770
I used to correspond a lot.

49
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,430
I'd get so nervous each time a letter came.

50
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,370
I can't remember how many times
I went to make payments.

51
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,180
That wasn't correspondence! Those were
bills for the crap you signed up for!

52
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,560
Was not! I remember it in my heart!

53
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,430
So you did go on an adult site?!

54
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,350
Shinpachi, a guy like him who's only
experience in love is in the gutter

55
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,610
can't know anything about writing letters.

56
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,220
Let me, your future brother-in-law,
handle it!

57
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,920
How dare you?!

58
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,660
The only experience you have
in love is paid sex. So don't talk!

59
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,310
Well then, let me ask. What
are you going to do now?

60
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,270
The girl has begun to take
an interest in Shinpachi.

61
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,310
So what should he say?

62
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,560
For example!

63
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,490
I work part-time at an Odd Jobs in Edo.

64
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,470
I'm always poor and my hobby
is chasing after pop idols.

65
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,350
How can you be popular with that?!

66
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,720
Odd Jobs is no place to work!
And chasing pop idols is weird!

67
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,390
You should talk, when you can't
even make it with women!

68
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,390
There's nothing wrong with Odd Jobs!

69
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,050
Yeah! And what's wrong
with chasing pop idols?!

70
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,640
It's better than stalking a
woman who hates you!

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,150
Well then, let me ask you. Are
you popular with girls now?

72
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,980
No, right? Naturally!

73
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,510
If you write honestly about
your current lifestyle,

74
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,250
what woman would be interested?!

75
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,110
Then are you suggesting we lie?!

76
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,020
We may have tinkered with the
facts a little, but we haven't lied!

77
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,610
Lie? As if I'd suggest anything
that's against the samurai code.

78
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,360
However, changing the
way the sentence reads

79
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,850
can greatly enhance the
impression it creates.

80
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,210
For example...

81
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,990
I train every day under a samurai named Gin
in hopes of learning the Way of the Samurai.

82
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,990
My hobby is music.

83
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,220
It's the one thing that I don't
mind opening my wallet for.

84
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,100
But as a result, I'm always
a little short on cash.

85
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,810
The content is still the same as before,
but the impact is vastly different.

86
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,190
There's more.

87
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,820
My dream is to revive
my family's sword dojo.

88
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,720
My sister has been doing her best
to support me and my dream.

89
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,350
My sister is a fine woman, beautiful, gentle,

90
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,850
and if I were to marry, she's the
kind of woman I'd like to find.

91
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,060
Lately, her beauty shines even more, and even
I, her younger brother, am dazzled by it.

92
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,060
In a word, her beauty is like a single flower.

93
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,780
So delicate, it's as though
it would fall if touched,

94
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,710
but at the same time, it has a strength
that makes it unbreakable.

95
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,100
What is even more amazing is
that even with all that beauty,

96
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:15,050
she remains down-to-earth. Her spirit
remains pure and she glows.

97
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,820
Is this a miracle?

98
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,930
No, it is not. It is she herself
that is the miracle.

99
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,630
And this beauty that we behold is a petite-miracle,
which was borne from the miracle that she is.

100
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,370
And even more amazing, my sister...

101
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,310
Too long!

102
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,620
Must you go on and on
and on about my sister?

103
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,450
As her brother, it makes me wanna puke!

104
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,350
You said change the point of view,
but now it's all your point of view!

105
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,040
Undoubtedly, even in my words,
my sister's existence is essential.

106
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,400
But you have to make it more
concise, or it loses its purpose!

107
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,850
I see. Oh well. I'll swallow my tears
and cut it down to one sentence.

108
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,480
She turns me on.

109
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,850
What kind of kid brother is that?!

110
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,850
Like I said, it's all your feelings!
By the way, is that all you feel?!

111
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,730
Please don't tell your sister.

112
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,600
As if I could!

113
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Say, let's just cut your sister
out of this already.

114
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,210
Having an older sister has
absolutely no merits.

115
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,470
Ultimately, she could be the sister-in-law.

116
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,190
Let's eliminate all negative keywords.
Just write about what works.

117
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,510
Under the guidance of
a samurai named Gin,

118
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,110
I get turned on every day and night.

119
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,390
Get rid of "turned on"!

120
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,980
The most negative keyword
is still being used!

121
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,650
What's this "turned on
every day and night"?!

122
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,550
It sounds like I'm like that all year long!

123
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,590
I get turned on during the weekends.

124
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,800
"Weekends" is fine, but delete "turned on"!

125
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,430
Enough already! Use the first
half, and forget the rest!

126
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,810
Forget...

127
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,840
You... Urara ...

128
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,290
What is your life like?

129
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,070
Miss, the ocean air is not good for you.

130
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,220
It's all right. Please leave it open.

131
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,890
So you have an older sister too, Shinpachi.

132
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:08,870
I have one older sister. But unlike
yours, my sister is very weak.

133
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,210
She has been sickly since she was a child

134
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,510
and spent most of her time
indoors, always alone.

135
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,040
So, she's very shy

136
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,410
and even though her health is better,
she's not comfortable around others.

137
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,340
The only ones she's able to talk to freely
are myself and our butler, Chanzo Sebasu.

138
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,880
And on the rare days she does go outside,

139
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,890
she gazes out at the ocean
towards far off lands.

140
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,600
She's unable to cast off the shell
she has built around herself.

141
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,970
What do you think about a sister like that?

142
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,820
Hey, she really latched onto the topic of
an older sister. More than we expected.

143
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,850
She didn't write a thing about herself.

144
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,640
Didn't I tell you? To leave out
writing about your sister?

145
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,040
What's the use of exchanging
notes about your sisters?!

146
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,860
Get the subject back to yourself!

147
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,930
But you can't just change the subject.

148
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,710
This is her dear older sister.

149
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,510
You have to do a follow-up, then
gently change the subject.

150
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,600
So how would I follow up?

151
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,030
Oh, so you're here, after all.

152
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,900
Kondo, get your act together, will you?

153
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,330
You slack off from work
and go roaming around.

154
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,090
Can you put yourself in my place
trying to follow-up for you?

155
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,290
Perfect timing! Toshiro Hijikata,
the follow-up man!

156
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,250
He handles all the problem kids and
follows up with them every day.

157
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,760
With Toshi, there's nothing
he can't follow-up!

158
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,150
What are you talking about?

159
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,330
Read this, Toshi-follow!

160
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,720
Cut the Toshi-follow! It's Toshiro!
And why should I?

161
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,190
Please read it, Follow-kata!

162
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,260
Get your names straight!
Nothing makes sense!

163
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,370
Hey Four-eyes, what do
you see in this woman?

164
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,320
I'm telling you, she's a Type bleep.

165
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,520
Type bleep?

166
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,710
Type bleep women are willful
and never listen to others.

167
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,970
[We are not allowed to broadcast contents that may encourage prejudice and stereotypes against different blood types.]

168
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:04,260
She talks only about herself and monopolizes
the conversation, then thinks it's going well.

169
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,920
If you don't do the proper follow-up,
she'll talk on and on forever.

170
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,460
And yet, she won't listen even if
you force another subject on her.

171
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,930
This really needs to be handled properly.

172
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,420
So what? You got something
against Type bleep women?

173
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,190
No!

174
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,580
Toshi, are you still stuck on that?

175
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,310
Never mind that!

176
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,490
It's different with someone
who's popular with women.

177
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,390
You give good advice, bleep-kata!

178
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,210
Stop calling me by all
those different names!

179
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,240
Type Peep will find that you can't get
much done today, but hang in there.

180
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,430
Type piip might get caught
in a sudden shower.

181
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,520
Don't forget your umbrellas
when you go out.

182
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,890
That's just fortune-telling! Besides,
why would it only rain on Type piip?!

183
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,060
In any case, what we need is a miraculous
follow-up that has a finality,

184
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,150
then we naturally switch subjects,
being careful not to hurt her.

185
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,660
That's a cinch. Just leave it to me.

186
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,990
It pains my heart to think about your sister.

187
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,970
But I'm sure your sister understands
your concerns.

188
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,510
I know that one day, her heart will open up.

189
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,950
Speaking of opening up, when will you
open up your legs for me, Urara?

190
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,260
That's not natural!

191
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,660
What kind of subject are
you trying to introduce?!

192
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,270
Even a caveman knows
how to be more delicate!

193
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,380
In love, we all return to
our primeval selves.

194
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,510
You can return by yourself.
And never come back!

195
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,470
This is ridiculous! There's no follow-up!

196
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,640
It's so flimsy! You're not thinking
seriously about the sister here.

197
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,350
When I think about your sister...

198
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,910
I get turned on.

199
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,100
There's no distinction with that!

200
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,930
That's not a follow-up. You're
only thinking about my sister!

201
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,370
Even an amoeba can do better than that!

202
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,990
Everyone gets gooey in love.

203
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,350
It's the inside of your head that's gooey!

204
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,220
Hijikata ...

205
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,720
Oh well, I have no choice.

206
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,240
You seem to be very concerned
about your sister.

207
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
But I don't think you need to be.

208
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,300
I can't feel sorry for your sister, nor do
I have words of encouragement for her.

209
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,170
After all, she does have a friend.

210
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,560
Me.

211
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,710
I will be your sister's friend.

212
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,960
If she's unable to break out of her shell,
then I will come to break it for her.

213
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,050
We say we'll release her, then we do
an ultra-dreadnought of a follow-up!

214
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,890
And with that follow-up, we nonchalantly
arrange to meet!

215
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,140
Please let me meet your sister.

216
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,810
Oh, please forgive me for
bringing it up so suddenly.

217
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,180
I've said some noble things. But
actually, I'm not such a great guy.

218
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,060
After all, I...I just...I just...

219
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,560
want to meet you.

220
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,810
There's the follow-up! We followed
up with Urara at the end!

221
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,810
It's not the end. We erase this
part. And now it's the end!

222
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,010
You erased it?! The line about
wanting to meet her?! Why?!

223
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:11,640
I-Is it because a youth like Shinpachi
would be too shy to ask to meet her?

224
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,390
So! It's a put-on that after he writes it,
he realizes he's too shy, then erases it.

225
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,870
You even followed up with Shinpachi!

226
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,770
It's perfect!

227
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,230
It's done! So this is known as...

228
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,220
the Follow-kata Toshi-follow!

229
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,440
Send it immediately.

230
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,180
Yes! Thank you!

231
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,830
Hey, guys,

232
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,070
I'm not gonna thank you.

233
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,530
No problem.

234
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,720
Every man goes down this path.

235
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,390
Oops...

236
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,530
I forgot to erase the line Kondo wrote.

237
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,100
[When I think about your
sister, I get turned on.]

238
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,200
How creepy! This guy gets turned on?!

239
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,110
Sis, forget this. No more corresponding!

240
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,910
Sister?

241
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,610
Say, what's the matter?

242
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,770
It's strange.

243
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,170
Every time he writes, the letters seem
like they're from a different person.

244
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,140
As though he's someone
with multiple personalities.

245
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,640
I've never had a friend, and all at once,

246
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,210
I feel like I have many friends.

247
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,880
What are you saying, Sis?

248
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,560
He's just a weirdo.

249
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,310
And, I've been writing as if I was you.

250
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,560
Yet he says he wants to help me.

251
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,000
That he gets turned on.

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,460
Sister! Do you even know what that
means? Getting turned on means...

253
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,840
...want to meet him.

254
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,220
I...

255
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,350
I want to try meeting him.

256
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,480
Gin-san! Hey, take a look at this letter!

257
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,310
This is bad. I want nothing
to do with it. Nothing.

258
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,370
Me neither! It's Toshi. It's all Toshi's fault!

259
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,850
You're the one who started this,
Kondo. It's not my problem!

260
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,260
I did it! I finally did it!

261
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,850
Urara wants to meet me!

262
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,640
I'm so happy that you're concerned about
my sister as though she's your own sister.

263
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,430
I would love for you and my sister to meet.

264
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,060
I'll be going to Edo with her,
so let's definitely meet.

265
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,420
Wow, I never imagined I'd
get to meet her so soon.

266
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,240
I guess it's really worth trying.

267
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,330
Thank you so much everyone.

268
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,010
One should always have a senpai who
can teach you about life. Really.

269
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,740
Hey, what's it mean?

270
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,010
She received a letter like that
and she wants to meet up.

271
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,700
Does it mean? No way!

272
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,370
She's turned on, too?!

273
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,400
Absolutely not!

274
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,490
Kondo! What're you doing?!

275
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,600
No way! 16 years old and turned on?!

276
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,510
I will not allow it. As a brother!

277
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,810
You're not my brother! Besides, you're
the one who's turned on the most!

278
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,230
When you're over 20. Get
turned on all you want!

279
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,890
Say, but you were horny even
before you turned 20.

280
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,310
I will not allow it!

281
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,380
What'll we do about this?

282
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,260
Sister! You can't! Not after
we came all this way!

283
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,190
Urara, stop! I really don't want to. Really!

284
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,010
What are you saying?! You're the
one who said you want to meet him!

285
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,670
I'll be satisfied if I can just get
a glimpse of Shinpachi's face.

286
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,760
I'll watch from the shadows,
so you go, Urara!

287
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,380
That's just pointless! Why did you begin
corresponding in the first place, Sis?!

288
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,260
In order to change yourself,
right? To make friends, right?

289
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,310
B-But he thinks you're his writing partner.

290
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,010
If I go, he'll only be disappointed.

291
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,520
There you go again, running away!

292
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,320
You're just scared of getting involved
with people. Of being hurt!

293
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,450
And if you don't change that about
you, you'll always be alone!

294
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,670
You'll be fine. Have confidence, Sis.

295
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,720
You're very pretty.

296
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,140
And why wouldn't you be?

297
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,670
After all, you're my sister.

298
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,210
So don't try to put on airs and
be something you're not.

299
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,060
Just be natural.

300
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,760
You're wonderful just the way you are.

301
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,880
Natural.

302
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,810
Yes. You get nervous because you
try to be someone you're not.

303
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:10,510
Just be yourself, do what you feel, be
true to who you are. Just act natural.

304
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,390
Do what I feel?

305
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,410
Like leaving!

306
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,510
Sis!

307
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,370
Darn it! For Sis, leaving
is what comes naturally!

308
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,050
Wait, Sis!

309
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,650
Excuse me. Are you Urara?

310
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,650
Hello, I'm Shinpachi Shimura.

311
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,260
Hey, why...

312
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,530
Why's Okita on a date
with her in my place?!

313
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,230
Now, now, calm down, Pachi.

314
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,810
He'll pull it off nicely.

315
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,040
He doesn't have to pull it off!

316
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,240
I finally got a date! How come a stranger
gets to enjoy the best part?!

317
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,380
He's no stranger. He's Shinpachi.

318
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,400
Remember. To her, he's Shinpachi.
Did you forget?

319
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,890
That's because you sent
that complicated photo!

320
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,780
But it's also because of this
photo that she wrote back.

321
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,740
S-Still, I've written diligently to her.
So what was the purpose of it all?

322
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,910
Who says it's going to continue like this?

323
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,030
Huh?! Then I'm going to
go out there and confess!

324
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm supposed to go out in
this situation and tell her,

325
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,350
"Actually, I'm the one
who wrote the letters"!

326
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,680
Calm down. If you go out there
now, you'll just lose to Okita.

327
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,180
There's nothing to be gained from that.

328
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,520
The difference between you two is like the
difference between the moon and turtle crap.

329
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,910
Just turtle will do.

330
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,850
Or like Ken and the crap from his crap.

331
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,390
[Note: Refers to movie star Ken Takakura who often plays the role of handsome, strong, honorable hero. Visuals refer to "Poppoya," a film about a lonely rail master.]

332
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,390
How about just crap? No, never mind.

333
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,780
In other words, even if you reveal yourself,

334
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,610
it has to be done under the right circumstances
or it won't work at all.

335
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,560
Look, if Ken's crap was
on the railway track,

336
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,270
even it could pass for Poppoya,
the rail master.

337
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,020
Not! Don't be so rude!

338
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,410
You want to look clumsy.

339
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,470
I'd say I'm pretty deft. Crapping on
the tracks between trains passing.

340
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,810
Anyway, Okita's gonna
play a bad role here.

341
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,100
He's your arch-rival.

342
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,260
And one day, he discovers that you're
going to correspond with a pretty girl.

343
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,560
He decides to take her away from you
and crumples up that first letter you wrote

344
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,610
Oh no!

345
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,060
and sends his own photo instead.

346
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,190
Later, he bides his time until you and Urara
have formed a bond and promise to meet.

347
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,850
And he waits for that moment!

348
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,380
However, who should appear but Poppoya!

349
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,640
Isn't that a bit too cliché?
Are you sure it'll work?

350
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,640
It's actually worse over here than a novel.

351
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,140
O-Okita?

352
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:34,120
I think that'll be simple enough. I'm not
good at remembering difficult things.

353
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,940
Are you sure, Okita? You
don't mind doing this?

354
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,890
Well, I owe Gin.

355
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,870
On top of which, Kondo just issued
a new set of rules for us.

356
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,630
Article 46, Hate Odd Jobs.

357
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,860
However, be kind only to Shinpachi.
Otherwise, it's harakiri.

358
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,640
That sounds awful. He's
really getting ambitious.

359
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Oh yeah, there's a bit of a problem.

360
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,890
Seems the girl came to Edo with her sister,

361
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,350
but that sister's gone missing.
And she's pretty nervous.

362
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,080
Sister? The one mentioned in the letter?

363
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,890
What do you want me to do? There's
no way I can seduce the girl.

364
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,760
Sis? It's easier to woo a woman
when there's no sibling around.

365
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,890
It's your chance. Just tell her you called
the police or whatever and go on a date.

366
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,690
Say, but I am the police.

367
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,890
You take a woman when she's worried,
drunk or on her graduation.

368
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,780
That's the usual. Right, Shinpachi?

369
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,640
Excuse me.

370
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,140
Sh-Shinpachi? Did you just say Shinpachi?

371
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,100
[To be continued]

372
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,570
The next episode...

373
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,750
"Sometimes You Can't Tell
Just By Meeting Someone."

374
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,180
[Finally these two meet: Shinpachi
and the sister.]

375
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:30,100
[Coming up next time, the end of the correspondence
episode. Please watch without getting turned on.]

376
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,130
[See you next time.]
