00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,540
Echigoya, you're quite an evil rascal! Omiya must be cursing you from the afterworld.

5
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,350
Surely you jest...

6
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,540
You were the one who set up his murder, Nezumiya-sama.

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,030
That was you.

8
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,530
Oh? Is that so?

9
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,520
There you go joking again!

10
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,540
I hope we can continue to do business together.

11
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,640
What is it? Is someone there?

12
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,660
Wh-Who are you?!

13
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,030
Like the sound of the bell at Gion Temple, nothing is permanent...

Good evening. Sachan, the assassin, has come.

17
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,190
Black market merchant Nezumiya.

18
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,890
You preyed on the weak common folk...

19
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,310
to fill your own pockets. An act deserving of ten thousand deaths.

20
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,690
I, assassin Sachan, shall punish you.

21

Hey, hey, I'm over here!

22
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,620
Prepare to die, Nezumiya!

23
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,000
What did you come here for?!

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,380
Oh, I'm sorry...

25
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,860
I dropped my glasses earlier.

26
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,820
Would you help me find them?

27
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,680

Ah, now I can see what I'm...

30
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,930
I wish I couldn't see now...

31

Intruder!

32
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,590
My plan has failed! Retreat!

33
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,710
What?!

34
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,740
She's getting away!

35
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,900
After her!

36
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,740
I messed up...

37
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,850

Good morning!

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,980
Oh, Shinpachi? Morning.

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,650
You're early today, Otose-san.

42
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,860
It's because all you guys are such goof-offs.

43
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,020
By the way, you promised to pay last month's rent by today.

Uh...right. I'm sorry.

Huh? What're you doing, Shinpachi?

69
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,250
Cut it out! I wouldn't do a thing like that!

70
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,290
You know I'm into nurse costumes.

71
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,640

Men should play around while they're young.

74
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,130
If they don't, when they're older, they'll be tricked by young women,

75
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,880
or become obsessed with weird fetishes.

76

That's what Mommy told me.

77
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,530
Your mommy went through a lot, didn't she?

78
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,600
Uh, I...don't remember anything. Did I do anything strange?

79

No, nothing.

80
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,760
I see, I see. That's great.

81
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,010
I thought maybe for sure I did something wrong while I was drunk.

82
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,490
There are no "mistakes" between husband and wife.

83
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,620
I'll go along with any of your crazy desires.

84
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,590
I beg your pardon?

85
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,700
Now, Dear...

86
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,060

87
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,490
Say "aah."

88
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,590
Ow-ow-ow.

89
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,190
That's not my mouth.

90
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,080
They say the eyes are as expressive as the mouth, but that's not my mouth.

91
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,500
What do you mean, "husband and wife"?

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,230
You will take responsibility, won't you? After doing what you did.

93
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,470
What do you mean "what I did"? I didn't do anything!

94
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,000
What're you talking about?

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,350
We were entwined with each other like this natto.

96
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,610
Ow-ow-ow.

97
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,710
I told you, that's not your mouth!

98
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,270
Gin-san, you can't change what you did. Accept it.

99
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,660
They say marriage is more about becoming familiar with one another than love.

100
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,190
What're you guys talking about?!

101
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,820
Your beloved Gin-san's about to be taken away by crazy natto girl!

102
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,600
This is ridiculous!

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,710
You're trying to trick me by using the fact that I don't remember anything!

104
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,330
In the first place, we don't even know each other's names, so how can we talk about marriage?

105
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,070
You act as if you don't know.
But our bodies know.

106
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,560
Stop talking like that!
And that's not me!

107
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,320
If your eyes are that bad,
put on your glasses!

108
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,060
They fell off. Here!

109
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,600
So, that's what happened.

110
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,230
My name is Sachan.

111
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,850
Please make me happy for life, my husband.

112
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,500
Uh...likewise. Please be good to us, too.

113
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,670
I prefer fish to meat for dinner, okay.

114
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,930
You're too quick to accept her!

115
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,720
Gin-san is over here!

116
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,090
I'll lay low here for a while to throw off my pursuers.

117
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,750
Looks like she's serious about staying here.

118
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,150
What are you going to do, Gin-san?

119
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,730
A woman who's serious is harder to get rid of than the fat in pork broth ramen.

120
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,490
Good grief.

121
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,750
Times like this, all I can do is calm myself down with something sweet.

122
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,380
He listens to what I say with no problem.

123
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,420
Men are such stupid creatures.

124
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,620
All I have to do now is play the cute, obedient, young wife.

125
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,670
Hey, anyone seen the pudding that I put in the fridge?

126
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,010
You know, the pudding I had in the fridge.

127
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,230
Oh come on! And I tried to hide it, too!

128
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,090
I guess I have no choice, you piggy you!

129
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,600
Huh?

130
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,510
What day is it today?

131
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,380
What is it? Garbage day? The expiration date on a food package?

132
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,380
Oh come on! You've already forgotten?

133
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,120
It's the anniversary of the day we spent together!

134
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,560
We just met a while ago.

135
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,130
Hasn't your personality changed?

136
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,330
Ta-da!

137
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,630
Natto pudding for our anniversary!

138
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,390
Am I being punished for something?

139
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,360
Today, I've made a special combination of our two favorite things!

140
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,010
Now, open wide...

141
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,010
Enough of this!

142
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,690
Hey, after pushing yourself on me as my wife, you're going to sully my pudding?!

143
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,080
The hierarchy in this household starts with me.

144
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,400
After that, it's sweets. Remember that!

145
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,620
Hey! Sweets are number two?!

146
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:47,180
I didn't play this right...
Bear it. Bear it, Sachan.

147
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,670
You don't have to be shy about it. Now have some.

148
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,670
I'm not going to eat this!

149
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,270
It's okay. This is actually pretty good.

150
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,050
Don't eat it!

151
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,690
You're not going to eat it,

152
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,570
so don't go trying to create a collaboration between the pudding and natto, fool!

153
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,000
Are you trying to be a producer?!

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,790
I'll hang a cardigan over your shoulders.

155
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,980
This is humiliating.

156
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,500
I was once one of the elite Oniwabanshu-why should I be subjected to this verbal abuse.

157
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,530
If you can't abide by these rules, then get out, you worthless woman!

158
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,040
But what is this? This feeling...

159
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,950
I'm going out to buy something sweet.

160
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,540
Wait!

161
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,310
How'd you end up like that?

162
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,550
The natto...it's sucking me in.

163
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,190
Why're you following me?
And what's with that outfit?

164
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,090
Men like young wives, right?

165
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,310
That's certainly a young wife's look,

166
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,110
but only Masuo-kun would like a young wife who looks like that.

167
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,380
That's someone else.

168
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,310
My pursuers won't recognize me in this costume.

169
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,670
Now all I have to do is play the cute, obedient, young wife.

170
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,760
What's the matter?

171
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,140
Nothing.

172
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,220
You just looked at that woman, didn't you?

173
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,510
Hmph. Is she your type?

174
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,760
No way! Are you trying to make me out to be a weirdo?!

175
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,140
What're you doing out here?

176
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,120
Who might you be?

177
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,510
Who am I? Who are you?

178
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,010
Gintoki?

179
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,650
You showed him no respect.

180
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,360
It's no big thing.

181
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,200
By the way, Gintoki, you said that by today, you'd pay last month's...

182
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,810
Just a minute. Don't talk to him so affectionately.

183
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,750
I'm sorry, but Gin-san is already...

184
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,240
mine!

185
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,460
What's with that woman? All I did was ask you to pay me!

186
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,740
So it's alimony you want, is it?

187
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,520
You had your fun, too! You don't deserve any money!

188
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,520
What's that girl talking about?

189
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,890
You're nothing but a woman from his past.
Immerse yourself in your old memories.

190
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,150
Hey! You think this is my former girlfriend?!

191
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,630
You really must think I'm a weirdo among weirdos!

192
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,090
I'm going to beat the both of you!

193
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,000
Could she be your mother? Is she your mother?!

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,550
Hey, if my mother were like this, I'd have become a delinquent in middle school!

195
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,880
I'd have had a punch perm!

196
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,040
Shall I give you a punch right now?!

197
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,580
Please forgive my rudeness, Mother.

198
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,680
What's with this girl?

199
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,090
She, you know, hit her head when she tripped and fell after chasing a stray cat that ran off with a fish.

200
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,320
She's a little light in the head and enjoys cosplay.

201
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,640
To be treated this rudely in public...

202
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,330
Yet why, again, do I feel...

203
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,180
This stirring in my heart...

204
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,840
More... I want him to torment me more...

205
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,490
What's wrong with this girl?

206
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,620
Man!

207
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,500
Gin-san wasn't firm with her, so now she really does plan on staying here!

208
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,090
Isn't it about time you showed her you're a man?

209
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,720
But I really did try.

210
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,180
That man is smitten with me.

211
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,660
Men are foolish creatures.

212
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,520
But what is this occasional throbbing in my heart?

213
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,140
I'm back.

214
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,400
Gin-chan, you don't think she's...?!

215
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,710
You mean?!

216
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,170
What? Me?

217
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,440
That couldn't be...

218
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,740
Hello? Sachan speaking.

219
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,940
Hello there, Miss Assassin.

220
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,040
You're...!

221
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,260
Nice to meet you last night. I'm glad to hear your voice again.

222
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,860
I think I've fallen in love with the beautiful assassin.

223
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,280
Nezumiya?!

224
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,340
I got your cellular number from...

225
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,730
your friends who snuck into my home.

226
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,340
I'd really like to meet you again.

227
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,070
You will come, won't you?

228
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,780
The stars may change, but the importance of one's friends...

229
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,350
never changes, you know.

230
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,060
Well, I'll be waiting.

231
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,940
Hey.

232
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,070
I've decided to deal with this. I'm an honorable man.

233
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,140
Even though I can't remember any of it,

234
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,230
I can't ignore you after what I did to you.

235
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,540
If you'll settle for a guy like me, then, please marry me.

236
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,110
Are...you serious, Gin-san?!

237
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,480
I see. Then come with me.

238
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,310
To the wedding hall?

239
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,350
I don't have too much money.

240
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,380
Ow-ow-ow! Just a minute...

241
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,590
This is my first time, so please be gentle!

242
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,540
I'd better be careful of women, too.

243
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,680
Shinpachi!

244
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,400
What's the matter?

245
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,330
That.

246
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,610
How long has that hole been here?

247
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,940
Sachan might be an angel from the heavens.

248
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,540
First, you need to meet my father.

249
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,550
An introduction, huh? I've come this far. Might as well keep going.

250
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,430
But why do we have to go this way?

251
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,090
I was raised in a very strict house, so I have a curfew.

252
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,510
Well, you guys sure have a nice, big house.

253
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,040
What?

254
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,920
Is your father a scary guy?
What kind of person is he?

255
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,090
He's an unscrupulous loan shark with hair all over his body and buckteeth.

256
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,820
What's with that?

257
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,170
Are you at that age when you don't want to do your panties in the same wash as his?

258
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,070
Every girl reaches that age eventually.

259
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,900
But try to remember-wasn't your father your first love?

260
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,880
Once we're newlyweds, I'm going to change these bad habits of yours.

261
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,660
I'm declaring my dominance.

262
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,920
Shh... Quiet.

263
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,940
Who's that?

264
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,860
Our manservant, Nakamura-san, the butler.

265
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,550
He's on lookout because I'm coming home late.

266
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,530
Let me tell you this now: I'm the type of guy who's pretty restrictive.

267
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,730
If we get married, I'll bind you to my rules.

268
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,830
Huh? Bind...?

269
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,130
What is this? Why does the sound of his words cause my chest to tighten so...?

270
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,470
I want to be bound...bind me! Bind me! Tighter!

271
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,840
Bind...me?

272
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,300
Darn right.

273
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,580
You won't be able to see your male friends or stay out all night with the girls.

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,580
Trouble. Nakamura-san saw us.

275
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,260
Wh-What's that?!

276
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,060
It's the assassin! The assassin's back!

277
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,890
Nakamura-san!

278
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,470
That's going too far!

279
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,430
Nakamura-san couldn't help it-that's his job!

280
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,400
Seems like a lot of them are coming.
Who are they this time?

281
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,710
It's Nakamura B, Nakamura C and Nakamura D.

282
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,670
So...they're all named Nakamura?!

283
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,870
It has begun. Father is testing the groom. Fight hard for me, honey!

284
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,090
Say what?

285
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,360
Let's go!

286
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,090
Hey! Don't leave your husband!

287
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,440
Allow me to report.

288
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,030
The assassin woman has broken through our security and appears to have entered the mansion.

289
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,650
Then set the traps! When you find them, kill them all!

290
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,510
Yes, sir!

291
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,370
They're like moths flying into a flame.

292
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,850
They won't reach here unless they get past all the traps.

293
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,350
Even if they manage to get here,

294
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,930
we have hostages.

295
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,770
We will finish them off.

296
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,030
Your father must be quite strict.

297
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,580
I'm practically out of work.
Think that's all right?

298
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,330
It'll be all right. Just as long as he can trust you as a person.

299
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,950
Bad! This is really bad! They're here!!

300
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,940
What the hell is going on at your house?!

301
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,330
It's a son-in-law test!

302
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,800
He's trying to see if we can make it together even if the path is closed off.

303
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,100
Closed off? It's coming right at us!

304
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,350
Hop! Step! Business Jump!

305
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,460
Seems he is testing whether or not you can withstand the pressure of taking over our House.

306
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,730
I think all I was doing was running away.

307
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,190
I've been expecting you.

308
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,180
Who's this?

309
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,740
My ex-boyfriend. He's working with my father to get in our way.

310
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,080
You're still seeing your ex-boyfriend?

311
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,620
I seriously can't allow that. I told you I'd bind you to my rules.

312
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,810
He's a bit of a stalker.

313
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,820
My foolhardiness gives me license throughout the land!

314
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,020
Hey, ex-boyfriend. Men who cling on without letting go...

315
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,390
are boors!

316
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,730
We need to hurry.

317
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,840
Right.

318
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,630
What's going on here?!

319
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,600
Who are those guys?!

320
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,760
Ex-boyfriends.

321
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,400
What? You've got to be kidding! All of them?

322
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,770
What number am I?!

323
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,440
This isn't good. We have to meet Father quickly and explain the situation.

324
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,110
All right, then you go on first! I'll come later.

325
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,950
But, what about you, Gin-san?

326
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,630
In a situation like this, no husband would stop his wife from going first.

327
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,600
Gosh, this is hard to run in!
I should've worn a suit!

328
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,860
I'll be counting on you, then!

329
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,500
Give my regards to Father!

330
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,970
Persistent bastards.

331
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,130
From here on, I won't allow you to take...

332
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,740
one step...

333
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,660
On second thought, no way!

334
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,910
Nezumi-sama! Trouble! Nezumi-sama!

335
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,540
The assassin woman has bested each of our traps,

336
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,340
and she appears to be approaching this way.

337
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,420
Many of the assassins we sent after her have been defeated.

338
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,570
Curses! She doesn't know when to quit!

339
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,090
Doesn't she care what happens to the hostages?!

340
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,430
Since it's come to this, mobilize every last man! Get rid of them at all cost!

341
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,530
Yes, sir!

342
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,980
Nezumi-sama.

343
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,910
Their objective is the rescue of the hostages.

344
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,700
I think the best plan would be to bind their friends to posts

345
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,930
and spear them to death in order to stop them from coming.

346
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,670
Well, then, I...

347
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,030
Oh no, my glasses. My glasses...

348
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,910
Hey, where are you going?

349
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,670
Shh... Be quiet. It's me, Sachan.

350
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,570
I'll rescue you now, so play along for a while.

351
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,590
There she is! It's the assassin!

352
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,160
Kill her!

353
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,330
Sachan! Run!

354
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,190
Sachan!

355
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,920
Wh-Who are you?!

356
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,400
The knockout-blow assassin!
It is I... Gin the groom!

357
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,950
Gin-san!

358
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,020
Father!

359
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,700
Please let me marry...

360
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,730
your daughter!

361
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,290
Gin-san? Hey, Gin-san!

362
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,040
Forgive me, Gin-san.

363
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,100
The truth is... Nothing happened between us.

364
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,320
Yet you... You let me use you like this.

365
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,830
Hey, what're you doing? I'm not hurt there. Did you hear me?

366
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,420
That's enough. Don't touch me. You smell like natto.

367
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,180
If you can't even treat wounds like this,
no one will have you as their wife.

368
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,010
See you.

369
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,180
Oh, and one more thing...

370
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,630
The next time you want me to help you,

371
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,470
don't do all this roundabout stuff and just come to Odd Jobs.

372
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,600
Think Sachan's fallen in love?

373
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,830
Who knows...

374
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,810
Men really are foolish creatures.

375
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,700
Good morning.

376
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,510
Gin-san! You'll miss Ms. Ketsuno...Ana's morning Weather Alert...

377
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,890
Gin-san, bind me tightly...

378
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,370
No, that's not what I meant.

379
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:08,460
[Preview]

380
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,450
If it isn't Gintoki!

381
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,660
It's me, Tatsuma Sakamoto!

382
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:08,170
What? A spaceship is about to crash? That's terrible!

383
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,100
The next episode: "When You're in a Fix, Keep on Laughing, Laughing..."

384
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,930
[After winning a drawing for a free trip to space, the Odd Jobs gang sets out.]

385
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,110
[But was the ship space-jacked and in danger of crashing on a planet?!]
