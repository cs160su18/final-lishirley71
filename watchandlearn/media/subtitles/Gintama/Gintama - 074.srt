00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,950
The strange incident started in Kabukicho, where desire churns...

8
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,670
There's a snack house on the outskirts of the downtown area...

9
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,610
And the person who works there...

10
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,270
Hey, Catherine...

11
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,250
Your eyebrows are on their way to becoming a unibrow. Take care of it.

12
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,010
Huh? Seriously?

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,510
...It all started with one hostess.

14
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,740
I'll shave them. Excuse me.

15
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,140
Don't expose us to something disgusting so early in the morning. Die, you.

16
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,250
You die.

17
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,520
You die more.

She's definitely the type who gets a white film around her mouth after drinking milk.

Ah, I know what you mean. A person who doesn't care if she has a milk mustache.

20
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,220
An attractive woman is born with a different type of pores.

21
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,370
If you have hair growing between your eyebrows, you can't even be considered a woman.

The only place you can live is in Kameari.

26
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,330
Gin-chan, your nose hair is showing.

27
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,370
There's nowhere for you to live in Snotnose Kingdom.

28
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,130
Police are investigating whether it is a simple accident or if a crime was committed.

29
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,360
Uh-oh, I wonder if this accident is in our neighborhood.

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,820
Oh, it looks really bad.

31
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,880
Ah? What are you doing, Catherine?

32
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,760
What's the matter? Did you get too excited and shave off both your eyebrows?

33
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,170
Your eyebrows! Didn't you just go to shave your eyebrows?!

34
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,890
That bridge... You've got the bridge of glory!

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,640
Whoa!

36
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,780
Isn't she overdoing it a bit?!

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,160
What are you doing?!

38
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,910
Leave her alone.

39
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,340
She probably got all stressed out from that old hag's daily harassment.

40
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,150
It's better to let it all out, little by little, rather than bottle it up inside.

41
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,320
But it doesn't look like "little by little."

42

Otose-san, are you all right?

43
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,710
O-Old hag... You...

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,730
Gin-san! Wh-Wh-What was that?! Their eyebrows! Their eyebrows!

45
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,100
Their eyebrows turned into unibrows and they went berserk!

46
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,970
I have no idea! Don't ask me!

47
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,710
Ah! There's a taxi!

48
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,720
Excuse me! Please let us in! Excuse me!

49

We're being pursued by freaks with strange eyebrows! Please open! Plea...

Oh yeah!

51
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,450
Tsk. What the hell is going on?!

52
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,730
Emergency alert! Emergency alert! This is for all residents of Kabukicho.

53
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,480
From this point on, leaving your home or Kabukicho is prohibited.

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,540
Anyone out in the open, please immediately go inside the nearest building.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,340
Please do not approach anyone with a unibrow.

56
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,660
They're very dangerous.

57

Anyone whose eyebrows are about to merge: Please shave immediately. Repeat...

58
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,370
Who are these people whose eyebrows have become unibrows?

59
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,750
Isn't that a riot?

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,150
It looks like they're increasing at a furious pace.

61
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,120
It's said to be a strange disease and once infected...

62

It's under investigation.

We heard that Kabukicho will be placed under martial law and completely sealed off.

64
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,150
It's under investigation.

65
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,130
That means...you've practically given up on the residents?

66
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,030
It's under investigation.

67
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,370
This year marks the 30th anniversary of Kochikame.

68
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,230
Is the anniversary related to this case?

69
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,640
It's the 31st anniversary.

70

72
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,390
No. Everyone has unibrows here, too.

73
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,930
Tsk. Oh, well... This way.

74
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,590
Put your hands behind your back and show me your eyebrows.

75
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,850
Katsura-san.

76
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,950
Oh, it's you guys...

77
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,830
Hang on, Katsura-san.

78
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,350
It looks like your eyebrows haven't fused together yet.

79
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,840
Let me tell you that it's useless to go in that direction.

80
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,430
Nothing awaits you beyond there but hell.

81
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,340
I barely broke through, but ended up like this.

82
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,510
Katsura-san, your flashback doesn't look right.

83
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,210
Any way I look at it, it appears you fell down and hurt yourself.

84
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,410
Throwing out the trash while wearing sandals was a mistake. Damn!

85
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,200
What do you mean "Damn"?

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,440
You got those wounds just from throwing out the trash? Isn't that from your attackers?!

87
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,920
Kitchen garbage smells really disgusting, so... Damn.

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,230
Zura, it's about time you threw out your head, too.

89
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,640
Zura, who are they anyway?

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,250
I'm not Zura, I'm Katsura. I don't know, either.

91
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,580
All I know is, people whose eyebrows turn into unibrows lose all self-control,

92
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,410
form mobs, and attack people.

93
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,250
And anyone caught by them grows a unibrow and goes berserk too.

94
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,730
Their high infection rates have increased their numbers in a frighteningly short time.

95
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,500
It's like Western zombies...

96
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,580
Eyebrow zombies... How about we name them Mayuzom?

97
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,310
Shut up.

98
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,960
Scum.

99
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,690
They're not scum. They're Mayuzom.

100
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,840
It looks like we're the only sane ones left in Kabukicho.

101
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,490
[Note: Kasura is word play for Katsura and Kasu means scum.]

102
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,490
Is there any way to survive, Kasura?

103
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,370
They're not Kasura. They're Mayuzom!

104
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,380
Damn it! The Mayuzom found us...

105
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,440
A-hem.

106
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,680
Why are you smiling?! You piss me off!

107
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,570
Gintoki! I'll never forget it! You said it!

108
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,510
You said "Mayuzom"! Now we can call them "Mayuzom"!

109
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,790
No way! I won't let things go the way you want!

110
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,190
This is not the time to argue about that! We're surrounded!

111
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,860
Hey, over here.

112
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,560
We're saved.

113
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,540
Thank you so much. You saved our necks.

114
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,060
No problem.

115
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,300
Hasegawa-san!

116
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,840
That's great! There're other survivors besides us!

117
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,700
I live in this pachinko parlor for my part-time job.

118
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,220
I was just able to escape any danger by hiding.

119
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,140
Hase...gawa-san.

120
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,690
But I was badly wounded by them.

121
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,030
I'll be a hindrance to you guys. Hurry up and get out of here.

122
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,980
I guess I'm on the brink of geezerhood.

123
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,200
I was done in by those guys.

124
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,760
Hasegawa, you'll die.

125
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,770
Who is that?!

126
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,810
That has absolutely nothing to do with the current situation!

127
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,530
He's the store manager. I overslept, so I was scolded.

128
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,490
What kind of store manager is that?

129
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,990
What's with those guys in the background?!

130
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,430
Damn it! If I hadn't been wearing sandals, I could've run faster...

131
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,780
Enough with the sandals!

132
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,420
You guys aren't even related to the Mayuzom and yet you're close to dying!

133
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,510
He just said "Mayuzom."

134
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,590
A-hem.

135
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,990
Don't smile! You're so annoying!

136
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,110
They've pretty much overrun most of the town.

137
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,520
Even if we keep hiding here, we're just waiting for our eyebrows to change.

138
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,500
Let's move forward instead of just sitting here.

139
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,370
We can consider moving forward, but I wonder where "forward" is?

140
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,890
Sachan-san! You survived, too?!

141
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,720
Look over there.

142
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,200
Ah, that is...!

143
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,350
A crowd of Mayuzom is heading towards us!

144
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,540
That's bad!

145
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,160
As things are, we won't be able to take a single step out of the pachinko parlor!

146
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,120
But why does it look as if they're being drawn into the pachinko parlor?!

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Because the parlor has new machines today.

148
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,640
New machines?! No kidding?

149
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,520
You're saying that's the reason why Mayuzom came here? I thought that only works for old men.

150
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,670
That's right! They are old men.

151
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,220
And they gather at other places, too.

152
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,260
Like gambling halls and horse racetracks and they get crew cuts at the barbershop.

153
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,210
Those are the places commonly favored by old men.

154
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,860
The moment their eyebrows merged together, they became old men.

155
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,720
Because of RYO-II!

156
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,090
RYO-II?! RYO-II! You said RYO-II?!

No way! RYO-II! Why?!

158
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,900
Eh? Really RYO-II?! Are you sure it's RYO-II?!

159
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,100
How many times are you going to say that?!

160
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,890
I infiltrated Kabukicho,

161
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,330
which has become an isolated island under martial law ordered by Lord Matsudaira.

162
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,670
But I never thought RYO-II would be involved.

163
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,110
I thought RYO-II wasn't related to this. There's no way RYO-II was...

164
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,230
That's enough. It's too much.

165
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,450
You're drawing it out too much. What's RYO-II?

...a hellish biological weapon used by the Marukome tribe during the Anderance Wars.

169
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,640
Their enemies on Shojo Planet looked like monkeys, so taking that into consideration,

170
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,310
a virus was created for use as a rough-and-tumble battle weapon.

171
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,250
That means it was a virus developed to affect people with thick hair.

172
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,410
The infected grow unibrows.

173

Whether they are women or children, there's no exception... Everyone...

They will become greedy moneygrubbers, always slacking off at work.

176
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,050
And even if they look like dynamic men, they're actually insensitive maniacs.

177
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,490
It's really disgusting... They'll become like that old man!

178
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,760
That is... I think you're obviously referring to a specific person.

179
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,530
Moreover, the virus was designed to only affect people with thick hair,

180
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,150
but only after direct contact with an infected subject.

181
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,420
Even those who aren't hairy can become infected.

Soon, it won't be just Kabukicho... All of Edo...

Hey... Everybody...

188

What kind of response is that?!

Well, you're talking about useless old men, but...

Right... The tension is...

What part of a useless man is bad?

Tell me and I'll correct it, one part at a time!

Wow, I can see how well the new machine works.

all the roads into Kabukicho have been blocked by martial law.

It's a rod used for holding sunglasses.

That thing? You can use a hook!

315
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,800
It's the hook with a goatee.

You, shut up! You piss me off!

320
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,450
Shinpachi-kun,

321
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,620
since early times, questions have been raised about where the human heart is.

322
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,370
Is the human heart in the chest? Or in the brain?

323
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,420
I don't think either is right... It's definitely in the sunglasses-

324
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,790
Don't you guys have any heart?!

325
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,660
We were saved by Hasegawa-san!

326
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,300
That's it! I'm not going to ask someone who has no heart like you anymore!

327
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,060
Let me off on the first floor.

328
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,910
Huh? The third floor? Hey! I said let me off on the first floor.

329
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,870
I don't know. I just pushed the button for the roof.

330
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,300
Then why did it stop?

331
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,600
You know, there's someone waiting for the elevator on the third floor.

332
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,440
Eh...

333
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,160
Don't let it open! Close it! They'll get in.

334
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,240
You bastard! What are you doing here?!

335
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,450
Don't frighten us like that! I'll kill you!

336

337
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,030
I wondered why I couldn't find you, but you were here. Are you all right?!

338
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,970

Great job, Elizabeth!

342
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,310
Awesome! That's awesome, Elizabeth-san!

343

What's with this guy? Why is he so blank-faced all the time?!

344

But how were you able to get through that Mayuzom mob?

345
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,220
Ah! I got it! Eyebrows!

346
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,670
When I think about it, Elizabeth has no eyebrows!

347
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,390
I see! If you have no eyebrows, there's no way they can merge together.

348
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,380
That is, Elizabeth has no fear of becoming a Mayuzom.

349
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,640
It's so encouraging! It's like we have an invincible fleet!

350

Because you looked into the virus, we were able to prepare a vaccine to combat it.
