You're gonna get sued someday.

158
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,930
Cut!

159
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,550
Okay!

160
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,780
All right, Otsu-chan. Good job.

161
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,210
Good job, everybody. Thank you very much.

162
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,440
All right. Next let's set up scene 12.

163
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,170
Listen, Mu-san is supposed to be at this shoot.

164
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,620
Keep a sharp lookout.

165
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,330
But I haven't seen Mu-san for a while.

166
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,960
H-Help!

167
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,830
The...the producer, Mu-san, is...!

168
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,120
H-He's...

169
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,750
What's an open-air spa doing at the edge of a cliff?

170
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,700
Everyone, what do you make of this case?

171
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,750
It began with a single threat letter, but now we have a victim.

172
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,400
The perpetrator is no doubt gloating about his perfect crime.

173
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,790
Those dazzling serial murders...

174
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,160
The mystery shadow approaches...

175
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
And the trick to a murder committed in a sealed room with no exit.

176
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,360
The secret will be revealed after this commercial break.

177
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,300
What serial murders?! This isn't a sealed room!

178
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,470
Why was Mu-san...?

179
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,590
All right, we'll take it from here.

180
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,630
We're taking this case. Don't touch anything unnecessary and don't destroy evidence.

181
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,470
You're the ones who're unnecessary!

182
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,620
Sea...

183
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,380
...louse...

184
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,980
It's his dying message!

185
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,530
Stop messing up the investigation!

186
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,190
Goemon-san! Right now? I'm at a hot spa for a drama shoot...

187
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,530
Oh you...

188
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,780
Sure, I'll do my best.

189
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,530
How about you? Oh, that's great!

190
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,650
What a dufus.

191
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,120
You knew you were gonna get hurt if you stuck your nose into this-you saw it coming.

192
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,150
You should've behaved yourself and stayed at home-peeling the pages of your calendar.

193
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,880
I told you I was going to protect Otsu-chan.

194
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,360
Trying to show off is a waste of time.

195
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,970
A girl in love is like a wild boar-it only looks forward.

196
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,490
It's not like that at all....

197
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,700
I owe Otsu-chan my life.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,250
It was before I met you, Gin-san.

199
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,470
I was still working part-time jobs.

200
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,180
I wasn't good at anything I did and was always getting scolded by the manager.

201
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,720
I was sick of everything and I was about to throw it all away and...

202
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,880
That's when I heard her.

203
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,000
To be honest, I didn't know what she was singing about,

204
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,930
and there wasn't an audience, but when I saw her singing her guts out...

205
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,620
my eyes teared up.

206
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,330
Thank you...

207
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:13,110
Otsu-chan probably doesn't even remember me, but she made me feel a lot better that day.

208
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,600
Anything at all.

209
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,650
If there's anything I can do, I want to do it to pay her back for her kindness.

210
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,550
This is all I can do, but I want to help her any way I can.

211
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,880
I get it.

212
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,810
If that's how you feel, then I have nothing more to say.

213
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,400
Gin-chan, Gin-chan, big news!

214
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,290
Pinko's here!

215
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,560
Pinko's here to tape "In This World, There are Only Demons, You Bastard!!"

216
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,900
What? Pinko...! I want...

217
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,770
your autograph!

218
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,370
Oh...the broadcast of "Utatte Iitomo" is ending soon.

219
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,220
Better use the john now.

220
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,530
[In This World, There are Only Demons, You Bastard!!]

221
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,860
Dad! Two dads?

222
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,610
Which one is the real one?

223
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,220
How'd this happen?

224
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,480
Sugako! This is all Sugako's fault!

225
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,560
What good is that going to do?

226
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,100
I think I know what happened.

227
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,890
I never imagined it would turn into a fiasco like this, you know.

228
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,200
That chick will never learn to shut her hole in front of reporters, you know!

229
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,750
"You know"? Could that be...

230
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,370
I haven't even groped her yet. This is ridiculous.

231
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,630
I'm signed up to do the Taiga soap next year, too.

232
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,210
That's right. So I figured I better take care of this first.

233
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,490
Women with no experience are no fun, after all, you know.

234
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,450
She fell in love with me right away just because I was nice to her, you know.

235
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,500
He's the only guy in show biz who's ever been nice to me.

236
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,500
That woman? I don't really care, you know.

237
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,460
She'll just disappear... anyway...

238
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,030
Wh-Wh-Who are you?!

239
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,240
You...call yourself human?

240
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,160
You're mother...

241
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,150
is a bleeping bleep!

242
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,010
Hey, come on.

243
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,760
Enough of this. My schedule's full.

244
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,840
We may not look it, but we're very busy.

245
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,200
That's right. You might be a detective or something, but frankly, you're a nuisance.

246
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,450
By the way, Tama-san, why're you on the set of a drama?

247
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,400
What? I'm, you know, the storyteller.

248
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,240
I told you from the beginning not to get in our way.

249
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,150
Well, I wanted to stay out of your way,
but I found out who the culprit is.

250
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,550
Let's make it quick and get it over with.

251
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,240
The culprit is...

252
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,960
You!

253
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,810
What're you talking about?!

254
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,740
I'd have no reason to do such a thing!
I'm the one who solves the riddles.

255
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,600
That's what all criminals say.

256
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,470
You're panicking and starting to sweat, Funagoe-san.

257
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,580
If you're going to accuse me, show me some proof first! Proof!

258
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,920
Proof...proof, you say...

259
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,510
You're the culprit!

260
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,550
That mole is suspicious.

261
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,850
I have an alibi.

262
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,050
Oh, I see. Then...

263
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,430
You're the culprit.

264
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,330
That's not possible.

265
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,190
Are you just saying these things because you feel like it?!

266
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,900
No, it's not really that, but...

267
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,430
I've seen through everything you've done!

268
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,080
Who're you?

269
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,110
Who am I?

270
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,570
I am the Sensei of criminal tricks.

271
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,690
Hey, you've got channel 10 and channel 4 mixed up!

272
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,710
I already know who the culprit is.

273
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,080
That's...

274
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,320
Goemon.

275
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,970
What is this? What's going on?

276
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,510
The second victim.

277
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,620
No. This isn't a victim.

278
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,550
I heard him talking in the john.

279
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,660
This guy is a scumbag who toyed with Otsu-chan's heart.

280
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,170
A scumbag playboy who considered the scandal with Otsu-chan a nuisance.

281
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,740
Then, he is the culprit?

282
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,690
Well...

283
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,180
That was...

284
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,370
Otsu-chan!

285
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,520
You're!

286
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,770
The mystery shadow!

287
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,670
It really does exist. How about that? It really exists.

288
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,130
Otsu, are you all right?!

289
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,200
Help me!

290
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,490
Look! A UFO!

291
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,660
After him, Shinpachi!

292
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,620
Right!

293
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,930
Stop!

294
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,100
This is fine work...

295
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,110
The treasure... The treasure!

296
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,510
Tomorrow, we will continue to see...

297
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,800
Commercial! Cut to commercial!

298
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,190
Give it up already!

299
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,360
He missed me...

300
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,430
Hey, you! Show your true self!

301
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,680
No, I've been like this from birth. I'm an Amanto.

302
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,250
Huh? What do you mean?

303
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,130
Uh...I'm at a loss to explain.

304
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,050
My form doesn't change when light shines on me.

305
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,830
I know you! I've seen him before.

306
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,230
Everywhere I went there was always somebody who looked like him.

307
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,880
I'm not anyone suspicious.

308
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,260
I'm just a fan of Otsu-chan.

309
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,300
I've been after her for several weeks in order to get her autograph.

310
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,350
In other words, a stalker.

311
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,420
You're complicating things, idiot!

312
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,000
H-Help me!

313
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,020
You must be the culprit!

314
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,800
You messed up her dressing room and sent that death threat letter!

315
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,980
What're you talking about?!

316
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,280
I did rifle through her dressing room,
but I never sent any letter.

317
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,540
Then who sent the death threat letter?

318
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,410
Who would benefit from Otsu-chan and that guy breaking up?

319
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,030
Hmm, that would be Otsu-chan herself.

320
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,430
The letter was sent by whoever wishes the most for Otsu-chan's happiness.

321
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,380
That would be...

322
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,840
you.

323
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,680
Yes...that's right.

324
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,900
You, Mo...?

325
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,850
I told you: I just wanted to give her a warning.

326
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,880
Just as you people said, that Goemon is the lowest form of scumbag.

327
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,830
Like me, that girl has no luck with men, and she's stubborn to boot.

328
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,890
There isn't a parent around who doesn't think of their child.

329
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,590
But there are also few children who understand their parents' feelings.

330
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,300
That's common sense.

331
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,510
Next time, convey your feelings in a more normal fashion.

332
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,550
We're both rather clumsy.

333
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,190
Who are you?!

334
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,990
I see. I understand...

335
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,750
Otsu-chan, I...

336
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,530
Forget it. Forget it. I'll be fine-I'm used to it.

337
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,290
I have bad luck with men.

338
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,310
The person I fell in love with before was Hard Gay.

339
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,600
Hard Gay?!

340
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,540
My mother was worried about me, but I was a fool.

341
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:48,350
Men dump me, and I've lost popularity as a pop star.

342
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,820
I've...lost everything.

343
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,160
Otsu-chan, I...

344
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,410
President!!

345
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,820
We came to help out.

346
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,400
It's not fair that you're hogging all the glory!

347
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,530
We're prepared to stand guard all night long.

348
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,580
All of you!

349
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,560
I'm afraid we're all very tenacious fanboys.

350
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,550
But we're not going to stop idolizing you over a little scandal or two!

351
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,370
Thank you, Shinji-kun.

352
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,620
It's Shinpachi.

353
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,700
Oh, I just passed out in the hot spa.

354
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,550
This has been Ginzaburo Yakihata.

355
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:21,770
[Preview]

356
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,730
Gin-san has amnesia?!

357
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,620
You mean he's forgotten me?

358
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,070
Don't give me that!

359
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,000
You mean, I remember him, but he forgot me?! That sucks!

360
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,940
Who does he think he is?!

361
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,070
The next episode: "You Always Remember the Things that Matter the Least."

362
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,550
[Shinpachi and Kagura do everything they can to help Gintoki remember.]

363
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,980
[Will Gintoki's memory return? If it doesn't...]

364
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,380
Not too many extras lately, huh?

365
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,730
Yeah.
