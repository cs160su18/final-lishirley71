00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,650
I saw a spider.

3
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,510
A spider tattoo on that man's neck...

4
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,850
A spider, huh?

5
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,050
Not much to go by, but oh well.

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,450
I'll have to let myself be caught.

7
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,880
In the spiderweb.

8
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm the one who brought
you into this mess.

9
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,190
Go, quickly!

10
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,510
I'll follow behind shortly.

11
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,520
Sorry, but I try not to take a woman's
last minute nonsense seriously.

12
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,940
Please go, I beg you.

13
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,900
I wish to stay as your equal.

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,190
When I'm with you, my resolve weakens.

15
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,620
Give up on being a woman, Tsukuyo.

16
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,380
Don't shake up my feelings any further.

17
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,200
Pay attention, you idiot!

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,460
You're the one

19
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,880
who's not paying attention.

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,880
["Once You're Entangled in a Spiderweb,
It's Hard to Get It Off."]

21
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,750
Gintoki!

22
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,440
Bastard!

23
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,870
You need to shut up.

24
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,580
Tsukuyo!

25
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,250
I knew you would come, Tsukuyo.

26
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,640
You've become so beautiful.

27
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,880
I almost didn't recognize you.

28
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,790
However...

29
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,530
Your soul has become
repulsive to behold.

30
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,390
A tragedy.

31
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,630
Who... are you?!

32
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,020
You must be the one
who ruined the moon.

33
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,940
The one who soiled my beautiful moon.

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,810
It must have been you.

35
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,840
I see...

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,160
Your movements are still sharp
despite the injuries.

37
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,280
I can see how you were
able to defeat Hosen.

38
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,420
Who the hell are you?!

39
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,980
Someone you can trust
to watch your back.

40
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,650
Someone who would protect you,
instead of being protected.

41
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,550
Did that bring back the womanhood
you thought to have given up on?

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,130
Or could it be...

43
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,020
You've fallen for this man?

44
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,430
Gin-san and Tsukuyo are really late.

45
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,890
They should have returned by now.

46
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,940
I hope that they weren't caught
up in any trouble.

47
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,800
Don't worry. She's with Gin-chan.

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,500
Though the fact that she's with Gin-san
gives us something else to worry about.

49
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,920
Anyway, sorry about today, Hinowa-san.

50
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,210
We checked all over but we weren't
able to learn anything.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,930
It's fine.

52
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,530
I'm sorry about forcing you to do this.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,430
To be honest, I was more worried about
her than this whole drug deal.

54
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,450
Are you talking about Tsukky?

55
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,460
Yes, Tsukky.

56
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,810
You're the only ones who
would call her that.

57
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,310
Does it sound dumb?

58
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,110
No, it's wonderful.

59
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,150
I'll call her Tsukky from now on.

60
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,190
She always tries to bear
the burden alone.

61
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm always so worried.

62
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,380
Protecting me and Yoshiwara for so
long, when she's only a woman...

63
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,460
Yet she never tries to rely on other
people when something happens.

64
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,450
She's so focused on protecting others that
she doesn't allow others to protect her.

65
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,470
It was the same this time.

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,990
She was thinking of how to deal
with this problem by herself.

67
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,130
Acting recklessly without considering
the danger to herself...

68
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,830
I wish she'd be willing to rely on
me when there was trouble.

69
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,480
It's because I'm so useless like this...

70
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,070
But it's different with you people.

71
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,710
When she's with you, she's able to relax.

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,750
Able to face you on equal footing
and ask for help or offer help.

73
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,350
Able to forget that she's the leader of the
Hyakka and become an ordinary girl.

74
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,980
You people are a true marvel...

75
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,110
Any heavy burden, any
attempt to shun others

76
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,500
feels stupid when we're around you.

77
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,750
Hinowa-san...

78
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,260
Was that a compliment? Or an insult?

79
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,460
It makes me happy to see
Tsukuyo look that way.

80
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,610
It doesn't have to involve business.

81
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,760
Please come to see her when
you have a little time.

82
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,240
She needs people like you.

83
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,870
Ever since he died...

84
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,070
He?

85
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,360
Who do you mean?

86
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,290
A long time ago, there was a person
she was able to rely on.

87
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,150
A person who would protect
her no matter what.

88
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,710
Tsukuyo, I made this clear.

89
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,480
One who can't give up on being a woman
couldn't possibly protect a thing.

90
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,200
Have you forgotten the pain
which came with that scar?

91
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:37,760
Tsukuyo.

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,780
If you wish to become one who protects
instead of one who is protected,

93
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,470
give up on being a woman.

94
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,630
How can you protect someone or something

95
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,160
if you're busy ensuring your own safety?

96
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,220
Devotion can only come
from sacrificing the self.

97
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,360
But devotion to what?

98
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,310
Not the Bakufu, not the
Shogun, not your lord.

99
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,610
It is to what you believe in,
what you must protect.

100
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,970
Yes, he protected Tsukuyo.

101
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,650
And Tsukuyo respected him in return.

102
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,870
However, it wasn't Tsukuyo
that he was protecting.

103
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,730
Tsukuyo turned out this way because...

104
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,040
Who are you talking about?

105
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,920
You may not be the sun which
shines above the people.

106
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,260
But I alone know of your lunar beauty
which secretly illuminates the land.

107
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,760
I alone shall watch over you.

108
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,430
I alone will protect you.

109
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,430
That's right...

110
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,890
I've come to protect your former beauty.

111
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,240
He was one of the strongest
Ninja in Edo.

112
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,740
Yet he was banished from the
Oniwabanshu for his sins,

113
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,100
and ended up in Yoshiwara.

114
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,630
Nobody knows his real name.

115
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,720
He's known as...

116
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,620
Jiraia.

117
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,820
The original head of the Hyakka.

118
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,420
And Tsukuyo's...

119
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,230
Ma-

120
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,290
Master?!

121
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Ma-

122
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,550
Master...

123
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,700
So you weren't able to see
through my disguise.

124
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,800
It's ironic.

125
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,210
I gave up my face when
I gave up my identity,

126
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,600
yet now that very face serves

127
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,550
as the only proof of my existence.

128
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,220
The face of my identity...

129
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,100
Master...

130
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,510
How can you be alive?

131
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,760
Why are you doing this?!

132
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,850
Isn't it obvious?

133
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,970
To see you, Tsukuyo.

134
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,690
He was the one who trained
Tsukuyo from a young age

135
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,760
to create a hardened warrior.

136
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,220
He was the one who made Tsukuyo
abandon her life as a woman.

137
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,810
He was the one who created
the Tsukuyo we now know.

138
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:48,030
And as a final lesson, he sacrificed
himself and died.

139
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,200
Died?

140
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,720
There was a great fire in Yoshiwara
four years ago.

141
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,090
He died to protect Tsukuyo.

142
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,110
He was never trying to
protect Yoshiwara.

143
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,200
He was protecting his beloved
student, Tsukuyo.

144
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,110
I'm grateful to him for risking
his life to protect her.

145
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,050
For providing her with support
this whole time...

146
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,940
But she remains reluctant
to depend on others

147
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,330
because she's walking in his footsteps.

148
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:53,710
And he probably wasn't even protecting
Tsukuyo as a person.

149
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,200
He was protecting Tsukuyo
as his creation.

150
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,870
Tsukuyo, you were a masterpiece that
came from my blood and sweat.

151
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,950
I have been watching you, ever since I feigned
my death and vanished from Yoshiwara.

152
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,830
And you alone...

153
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,120
After losing your only source of support,

154
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,720
you were desperate to protect Yoshiwara,
Hinowa on your own.

155
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,510
You were beautiful to behold.

156
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,350
Just like the moon.

157
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,700
Humans acting in selfless devotion can
transcend flesh, good, and evil...

158
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,720
Only your beautiful soul remains.

159
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,150
You would have never been perfected
as a creation without my aid.

160
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,370
But my existence was also
preventing your perfection.

161
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,130
A weak human who had someone to rely
on could never sacrifice her sense of self.

162
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,710
Once your heart is strong enough to bear

163
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,640
the loneliness of having
no one to depend on,

164
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,390
you are able to abandon
your sense of self.

165
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,520
You were perfected when you lost me.

166
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,860
Yes, that should have been the end.

167
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,070
Until you all appeared!

168
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,930
Tsukuyo, you understand nothing.

169
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,560
You do not need anything
to rely on, depend on.

170
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,050
You only need solitude and
an enemy for your blade.

171
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,240
Look, Tsukuyo.

172
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,760
You will watch as one who
protects you vanishes.

173

to replace your King of Night.

threads as a foothold?!

192

With your death, the moon
will become whole again.

193

from the afterlife.

Not my problem.

200
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,530
I didn't see a thing.

201
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,050
I've been reading JUMP the whole time.

202
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,580
Because Ninjas can read
JUMP even in the dark.

Are you stupid?

210
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,420
It'll take more than this to kill Gin-chan!

211
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,200
But he was unconscious
for three whole days!

212
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,150
And these injuries are terrible.

213
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,560
Hey, why am I alive?

Oh, it's fine.

I got a bunch of coupons

I actually used to work for the Shogun.

You're such a kidder.

Why would someone from
a fine background

surround himself with fuglies
in a rundown club.

226
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,530
I find more beauty in ruined buildings

Were you attacked by a Giant Warrior?

Is this how you treat the man
who saved your life?

Do you have any idea how hard it was to fish you
out of the ocean and drag you down here?!

240

What the hell are you babbling about?

241
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,190
You have no right to talk when you stood
by and watched while I was almost killed.

Why would I come to your rescue?

Besides, I have no interest in pretty girls.

245

246
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,850
Had a little business to take care of.

247
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,320
The pretty girl was taken.

248

Where'd they go?

249
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,900
Beats me. I said that I have
no interest in pretty girls.

Hey, where are you going?

251

Just to be clear,

252
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,450
you don't have a chance against him.

253

Even if you weren't all beat-up.

254
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,870
So you have no interest in pretty girls,

255
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,290
but you seem to be very interested
in fuglies and old men.

He belonged to the last generation.

His power was said to rival my old man's,
the strongest of the Oniwabanshu.

259
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,890
However, despite his abilities, he was
banished from the Oniwabanshu...

260
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,180
Because of his dangerous nature.

I'm trying to be helpful.

262
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,700
Give up on the woman.

If you've been caught in his web,

you're beyond saving.

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,150
Master...

268
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,940
No, Jiraia...

269
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,810
You no longer wish to call me master?

270
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,960
That's fine.

271
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,550
You only need solitude and an enemy.

272
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,150
So I'd been struggling in your
web all these years?

273
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,870
I believed you.

274
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,600
I wanted to follow in your footsteps...

275
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,940
But it was all a lie?

276
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,240
What was it that you believed in?

277
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,660
The kind master who gave
his life to protect you?

278
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,440
Or the harsh master who taught you
the meaning of selfless devotion,

279
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,490
to give up your identity, to give
up on being a woman?

280
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,580
In that case, it wasn't a lie.

281
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:04,840
Even now, am I not sacrificing myself
for the sake of creating you?

282
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,220
Creating me?

283
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,110
You killed him just for that reason?

284
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,610
That's right.

285
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,180
If you hadn't grown weak,

286
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,890
I would have left Yoshiwara alone.

287
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,860
If you hadn't learned to rely on others,

288
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,940
I wouldn't have killed that man either.

289
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,540
You are the one who killed him, Tsukuyo.

And the tragedy that will soon play out

protect Yoshiwara and Hinowa.

That was the oath you
swore on that scar...

But Yoshiwara has become more
than a place for you to protect.

It has become a place where you belong,
where you can rely on others.
