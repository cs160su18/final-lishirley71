00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,180
This is...

3
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,290
You're awake?

4
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,110
I think we screwed up.

5
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,850
Ow.

6
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,510
I can't remember anything.

7
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,420
Feels like I was hit in the head.

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,970
What happened?

9
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,480
Where are we?

10
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,620
Why are we chained up in here?

11
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,940
You don't remember, Hijikata-san?

12
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,280
Someone attacked us from behind during our night patrol...

13
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,170
Bastard...

14
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,010
So we've been captured.

15
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,070
Yes.

16
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,350
Since the moon is out again, we've probably been out for a whole day.

17
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,560
I don't know where we are.

18
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,870
Probably a room in some ruin.

19
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,450
We're definitely somewhere remote of human life.

20
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,540
I yelled at the top of my lungs and got no response.

21
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,270
In fact, I can't even sense the presence of other people.

22
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,120
It appears that the people who captured us aren't around either.

23
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,300
Damn it!

24
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,260
We've really lost our edge.

25
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,370
Who the hell did this?!

26
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,270
It appears you understand your current situation...

27
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,210
Shinsengumi Vice-Chief Toshiro Hijikata-kun...

28
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,720
And 1st Division Captain Sogo Okita-kun.

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,560
Who the hell are you?

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,260
Pleased to meet you.

31
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,940
My name is Jigzaw.

32
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:30,270
["Zip Up Your Fly Nice and Slowly."]

33
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,840
Hijikata-kun and Okita-kun, welcome to my game of death.

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,080
Jigzaw?

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,570
You're the one who's behind this crap?

36
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,970
Another Anti-foreigner Faction?

37
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,310
You must be one hell of a coward to hide behind a mask on that monitor.

38
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,020
Your barking befits a government dog, Hijikata-kun.

39
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,680
Your current look becomes you.

40
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,440
But you shouldn't be snarling at me right now.

41
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,060
Shouldn't you be wagging your tail and begging for your life?

42
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,620
What was that?!

43
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,830
Get your ass down here!

44
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,950
A mere joke. No need to throw a hissy fit.

45
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,130
I merely wanted to imitate those patriots.

46
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,140
Too bad, Hijikata-kun.

47
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,890
I am not one of those barbaric Anti-foreigner Faction members.

48
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,590
I hold no grudge against the Shinsengumi,

49
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,470
and I have no reason to oppose you.

50
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,970
I just happen to be a fan.

51
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,110
I always see the exploits of the Shinsengumi on TV and in the newspaper.

52
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:44,470
You and your comrades have endured all sorts of hardship because of your trust in one another.

53
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,180
An iron bond that cannot be broken.

54
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,200
Yes, that bond is your strongest weapon.

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,970
That is what has drawn my intense attraction.

56
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,320
A true fan would want to see it in person.

57
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,980
Sorry about the short notice, but I have an announcement to make.

58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,830
In three days, in other words, in 72 hours at 7 PM,

59
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,830
the Shinsengumi station where your comrades are

60
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,470
will be blown to smithereens by a time bomb I have placed.

61
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,920
The bomb has been placed in the communications room.

62
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,320
You are the only ones who know.

63
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,990
Which would mean that you're the only ones who can stop it.

64
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,280
Wh-What are you trying to...

65
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,420
This is a game.

66
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,560
I want to play a game to test how strong your bond is.

67
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,980
You are the only ones who can save your comrades.

68
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,140
But first, you need to break those chains and escape from this room.

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,560
Don't worry. This is a game.

70
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,470
A game with no goal is no fun.

71
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,260
I've prepared a goal.

72
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,380
There's a passageway under this monitor.

73
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,090
I've placed the key at the end of the passage.

74
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,030
Of course, I'm talking about the key to undo your chains.

75
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,890
This is as far as the chain goes.

76
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,170
We can't reach back there.

77
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,800
Stop messing with us!

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,040
How are we supposed to get back there?!

79
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,790
The two of you are bound by one chain that's wound around a pipe.

80
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,450
If one of you pulls on the chain, it becomes shorter for the other side.

81
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:37,770
If one of you retreats against the wall and the other one pulls the chain as far as possible,

82
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,390
you may be able to reach it.

83
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,930
Stop giving me crap!

84
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm on the wall! On the wall!

85
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,560
Sogo! You bastard!

86
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,300
What are you doing?!

87
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,840
Hijikata-san, could you press against the wall more?

88
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,050
I'm almost there.

89
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,130
Don't be stupid!

90
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,120
Are you trying to crush me to death?!

91
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,880
You're not going to reach it!

92
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,240
He's tricking you!

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,550
That guy just wants to have fun toying with us!

94
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,650
The bomb at the station could just be a lie!

95
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,680
Calm down for a second!

96
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,930
Hijikata-kun, you're free to believe me or not,

97
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,120
but that key is the only way out of here for you two.

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,410
I apologize.

99
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,970
I need to correct myself.

100
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:32,560
That key is the only way out of here for one of you.

101
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,750
One... of us?

102
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,060
What do you mean?

103
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:46,100
Those shackles on you contain a bomb set to go off under a certain condition.

104
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:53,330
The condition for explosion is the unlocking of the other person's shackles.

105
00:07:53,330 --> 00:08:01,570
Once one bomb has been disarmed, a signal will be sent to the other bomb to detonate.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,690
In other words, if you don't obtain the key first, unlock your shackles, and disarm the bomb,

107
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,070
whoever's left will...

108
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,260
die.

109
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,920
Hijikata-san, didn't you say that we shouldn't let him toy with us?

110
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,420
There's nothing wrong with playing along once in a while!

111
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,380
It wasn't easy making it big in the city after moving from the country!

112
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,490
It appears that you've woken up, Hijitaka-kun.

113
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:37,430
In order to save your precious comrades, you must first kill one of your precious comrades here.

114
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,350
Y-You bastard!

115
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:49,430
Why don't you show me how your bond will guide you through this trial?

116
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,420
Hiro-kun! Dinner's ready!

117
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,810
Hey! Why'd he cut off there?!

118
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,720
His mom?

119
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,540
That was his mom was calling him, right?

120
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,110
She called him Hiro-kun, right?

121
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,870
That didn't sound anything like Jigzaw, right?!

122
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,900
Who the hell is he? What does he want?

123
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,140
How dare he make fools of us!

124
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,030
Why did this happen...

125
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,700
Why are we in this situation...

126
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,170
Why...

127
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,100
Why did it have to happen when I was with this guy...

128
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,890
I'm dead.

129
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,540
Without a doubt, I'm dead.

130
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,520
He's always wanted to get rid of me.

131
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,600
He's pulled all kinds of crap to try to take the position of Vice-Chief from me.

132
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,850
But the watchful eyes of the other officers,

133
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,370
Kondo-san acting as a brake,

134
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,600
and the fact that I'm his superior

135
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,810
combined to stop him when things got dangerous.

136
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
But now, he's been given a legitimate reason.

137
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,530
He killed me to save everyone.

138
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,640
He killed me to stop the bomb.

139
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,700
This is dangerous. Very dangerous.

140
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,120
The station's also in danger, but my life is in even more danger!

141
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,210
Hijikata-san. Hijikata-san.

142
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,450
Wh-What is it?

143
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,250
You okay over there? Seemed a little spaced out.

144
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,040
Don't tell me that imitation psycho's got you spooked.

145
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,300
Hell no! Don't look down on me!

146
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,660
Damn bastard looking down on me!

147
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,090
I'll kill you bastard!

148
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,130
Hijikata-san.

149
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,470
Could we stop standing like this?

150
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,760
That's right.

151
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,990
It's okay now.

152
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,990
Okay, yeah?

153
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,110
Then we'll go at the same time.

154
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,410
Relax at the same time.

155
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,620
On the count of three.

156
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,630
Hijikata-san.

157
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,010
Do you think I'm going to go for the key the second you relax?

158
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,600
No, no. No way.

159
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,050
Not the least bit, but this prevents any potential trouble.

160
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,400
And I don't want you suspecting me.

161
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,700
Give me a break.

162
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,900
You don't have to worry this time.

163
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,110
The Shinsengumi's in serious trouble.

164
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,480
This isn't the time for us to be fighting amongst ourselves.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,040
I know that, fool.

166
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,140
I can differentiate between serious parts and gag parts.

167
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,690
Don't get the wrong idea.

168
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,830
Man, I'm depending on you, you know.

169
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,410
You just jumped.

170
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,410
I just have to take a piss.

171
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,960
I was out cold since yesterday so it's been a day since I've gone.

172
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,080
Don't you need to piss, too?

173
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,600
Now that you mention it, yeah.

174
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,140
You should probably take care of it while I am.

175
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,320
Once I'm finished, you'll be too jumpy to do your business.

176
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,610
I'm said I'm not jumpy!

177
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,070
Don't look down on me.

178
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,370
Cut it out already.

179
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,810
I'm not jumpy, but I need to piss, so I have no choice.

180
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,040
I'm not doing this because I'm jumpy.

181
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,090
Hurry it up.

182
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,460
Finish my business while he's still going.

183
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,470
Going to the bathroom, sleeping, and eating are when a person is most vulnerable.

184
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,090
If I don't take care of this now, I won't be getting another chance...

185
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,680
Wait!

186
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,820
Could this be... a trap?

187
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,840
He's only pretending to take a piss,

188
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:54,310
and once I'm urinating, he plans to go for the key.

189
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,510
Wait. Calm down.

190
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,010
Drag this out as long as I can.

191
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,480
Don't release until I can be sure he's urinating.

192
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,500
Release when he does.

193
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,810
If I'm too late, he'll have a chance if I take longer.

194
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,170
No piss. He isn't pissing!

195
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,510
So this is a trap.

196
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,640
I was about to be fooled.

197
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,870
...Sogo! Too weak.

198
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,620
I'm not going to fall for your scheme...

199
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,490
I-It...

200
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,220
It's stuck!

201
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,220
[Note: Parody of the movie "There's Something About Mary"]

202
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,100
Damn it!

203
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,420
I zipped up too fast because I was worried about giving him a chance!

204
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,390
G-Get a grip.

205
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,830
Don't let me know anything's wrong.

206
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,320
That'll give him a chance.

207
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,980
It's okay.

208
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,500
He hasn't noticed.

209
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,810
H-He tricked me!

210
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,300
That bastard!

211
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,250
First, he pretended that he wasn't going to piss and then he started urinating once I zipped up?!

212
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,680
That was a feint?!

213
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,210
It's too late for me to go now.

214
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,290
He'll definitely finish first.

215
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,490
And I can't piss a single drop in this intense pain!

216
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,810
Was this all part of his plan?

217
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,360
No, it couldn't be.

218
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,190
That would be impossible for me to deal with.

219
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,780
I have to give up on taking a piss.

220
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,120
But I can't let him know.

221
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,770
Need to pull myself together.

222
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,970
Show no weakness! Don't give him a chance!

223
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,220
Man, that was a long piss.

224
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,020
Must have had a bunch built up.

225
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,160
Might have been a whole liter.

226
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,660
Oh, yeah.

227
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,800
Not sure if I had that much...

228
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,090
About three drops...

229
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,890
Of what?

230
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,710
Good day.

231
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,970
It's a beautiful morning.

232
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,130
How do you feel after spending half a day here?

233
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,610
I can see signs of struggling, but it's futile.

234
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,470
That chain is made from a special alloy.

235
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,970
And this room doesn't contain anything that will help you escape.

236
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,800
Besides for the key.

237
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,310
It would be much more productive to discuss which one of you will die.

238
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,020
You should hurry.

239
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,470
There are less than sixty hours to the explosion.

240
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,690
If you take too long, you won't be the only victims.

241
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,810
All of the members of the Shinsengumi will lose their lives.

242
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,510
What are you after?

243
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,750
What's so fun about this?

244
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,740
I am Jigzaw.

245
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,320
An empty existence born from nothingness.

246
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,250
I have nothing.

247
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,640
Neither dead nor alive.

248
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,800
Neither blood nor flesh nor bone can be found under this mask.

249
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,580
Which is why I wish to know.

250
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,800
What lies within humans.

251
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,840
What lies in the depths of the human heart.

252
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,420
What I may find under that skin.

253
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,470
Comrades, colleagues, bonds...

254
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,910
You can sound hopeful...

255
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,640
You can hide behind a mask of ideals...

256
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,250
But humans will abandon it all once they're cornered.

257
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,640
Revealing the ugly face behind the mask.

258
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:03,920
My empty heart is finally filled when I see the ugly entrails spread along the floor.

259
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,740
That is my sole amusement.

260
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,180
You are fortunate people who have been invited to my game.

261
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,900
Entertain me... with your lives.

262
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,570
Hiro-kun!

263
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,910
What time do you think it is?!

264
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,940
Get up already.

265
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,810
You'll be late for school...

266
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,010
His nothingness was just on camera!

267
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,360
It was just an old lady, right?

268
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,070
That was just his mom, right?

269
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,350
Hijikata-san.

270
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,970
We don't have time to worry about that fool.

271
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,230
Let's keep working.

272
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,340
If we can't break the chain, let's try doing something about the pole.

273
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,730
Yeah.

274
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,770
Bastard... When is he going to show his true colors?

275
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,910
He hasn't let a thing slip.

276
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:51,680
I expected him to go straight for the key, end my life, and escape from this place,

277
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,390
but he's paid no heed to my caution and been like that all night.

278
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,860
I thought he may even attack me with that stone, but he hasn't done it.

279
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,470
Does he really intend for both of us to escape this place?

280
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,710
No, he would never do such a thing.

281
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,310
Besides, he should know how futile that is.

282
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,990
We need that key to escape from this place.

283
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,750
But why won't he move?

284
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,140
What is he thinking?

285
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,330
Bastard... When is he going to show his true colors?

286
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,990
He hasn't let a thing slip.

287
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,600
I've given him so many opportunities.

288
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,290
He had many chances to go for the key.

289
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,490
But why won't he act?

290
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,880
What is he thinking?

291
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,490
Act, Sogo.

292
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,060
I'm ready for you.

293
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,810
But not to die after being betrayed.

294
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,450
Act, Hijikata.

295
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,740
I'm prepared.

296
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,540
But not to die after being betrayed.

297
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,520
I'm set to kill you once you betray me.

298
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,250
It'd be simple to get the key before him.

299
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,190
Then I could get rid of that obstacle, Hijikata, and save the Shinsengumi.

300
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,850
But that's what the imitation psycho wants.

301
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:21,430
He wants to watch us lose our trust in each other, betray each other, and reveal our ugly selves.

302
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:27,430
I don't want to die at Sogo's hands, but I don't want to act as Jigzaw wants.

303
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,170
I'll pretend to do the right thing till the end.

304
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,950
I need him to play the traitor.

305
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,580
I just have to wait until he makes his move.

306
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:44,830
Once he moves, I'll have a legitimate reason to kill him as a traitor in order to save the station.

307
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,150
You aren't the only one with a reason to eliminate an obstacle.

308
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,060
If that's what you intend to do, I won't hold back.

309
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,930
Act. Make your move.

310
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,050
Betray me, Hijikata.

311
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,200
The second you draw your sword will be your last second!

312
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,940
He isn't making a move.

313
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,310
He must be hesitating because I'm being too vigilant.

314
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,960
I need to actively attempt to create a chance.

315
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,760
A chance for him to take advantage of me.

316
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,310
I need to prepare plenty of bait.

317
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,480
Sogo, why don't you take a break?

318
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,850
You've been at it since yesterday.

319
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,170
Your body won't hold up at this rate.

320
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,870
You'll be a burden if you can't move your legs when we escape.

321
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,850
Get some sleep and let me take over.

322
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,930
It'll be noisy, so go over by the passageway.

323
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,700
No, Hijikata-san, you look more tired than me. Go to sleep.

324
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,810
The area by the key looks cool and refreshing.

325
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,800
No, you.

326
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,430
No, Hijikata-san, you should sleep.

327
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,920
What's with this guy? He won't make a move.

328
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,840
I understand.

329
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,990
Then I'll accept your offer and sleep.

330
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,280
Please don't run away by yourself while I'm asleep.

331
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,700
I'm exhausted so I'll be sound asleep and hard to wake up.

332
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,930
No, wait. I'll sleep instead.

333
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,360
On second thought, I'm terribly tired.

334
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,000
It'll be really hard to wake up once I've fallen asleep.

335
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,140
I doubt anything could wake me up.

336
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,140
Here it comes.

337
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,530
No, I'll go to sleep.

338
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,300
I said that I'm sleeping.

339
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,970
I can barely keep my eyes open.

340
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,920
Why won't he make a move?

341
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,670
Why doesn't he take this chance?

342
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,970
In fact, he's...

343
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,060
After coming up with this plan, don't tell me that he's...

344
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,730
waiting for me to betray him?

345
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,100
Okay, that's good.

346
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,210
We'll both sleep.

347
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,840
Kondo-san and the others may come to save us while we're sleeping.

348
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,970
No, he couldn't be. I'm overthinking this.

349
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,450
No, he doesn't have the time.

350
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,170
His own life and the lives of the Shinsengumi are on the line.

351
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,120
Good night then.

352
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,690
Good night.

353
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,220
He'll definitely betray me.

354
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,100
He'll hop out and go for the key before five minutes have passed.

355
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,830
Hey, morning.

356
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,890
Good morning.

357
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,060
H-Half a day's gone by!

358
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,220
And I didn't get a wink of sleep!

359
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,430
All that standing around expecting him to betray me or jump out any second wasted so much time.

360
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,230
I managed to get some rest.

361
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,720
How could I...

362
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,830
I wasted precious time and energy...

363
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,800
Yeah, I feel so much better.

364
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,200
No doubt about it.

365
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,510
This bastard doesn't intend to betray me.

366
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,060
Damn it, Sogo.

367
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,060
What's going to happen if you don't betray me?

368
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,270
If we don't escape from this place, the Shinsengumi will be wiped out!

369
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,440
I won't let you force me to play the dirty role, Hijikata.

370
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,220
Hurry up and betray me.

371
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,580
Do you expect me to betray you, Sogo?

372
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,950
Don't be ridiculous.

373
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,880
I absolutely won't betray you.

374
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,540
I'll stick with you to the very end!

375
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,070
It's useless, Hijikata.

376
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,790
It doesn't matter how dirty you are, I still won't betray you.

377
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,520
No matter what happens, you're my buddy!

378
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,670
48 hours until the Shinsengumi station goes boom.

379
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,650
Well?

380
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,300
Have you decided which one will die?

381
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,070
Sorry, but neither one of us is going to die.

382
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,620
Oh, so you're going to abandon your comrades at the station for the sake of living a little longer in this place.

383
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,230
Nobody's going to die.

384
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,850
Both of us will escape from this place.

385
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,700
Th-That's right!

386
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,510
The two of us will stop the bombing of the Shinsengumi station together!

387
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,940
And we'll catch you together, without a single member missing!

388
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,480
I'm impressed that you can still cling to those ideals.

389
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,020
Do you truly believe you can escape without that key?

390
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,370
We'll find a way if we work together.

391
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,300
That's right.

392
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,550
Don't look down on us.

393
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,180
We will never betray each other!

394
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,000
I see.

395
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,310
Which means you don't need this key.

396
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,300
Wh-What?!

397
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,020
Th-That's...

398
