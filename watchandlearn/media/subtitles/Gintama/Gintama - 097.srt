00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,370
How'd you do it?

157
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,910
Shut up. Go away.

158
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,470
That sure is nice. It sure is cool...

159
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,450
I want to wear one, too.

160
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,080
What's wrong with you?

161
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,330
Hey, what are you doing?

162
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,030
We don't have any more cooling gel packs.

163
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,820
Gin-san, your rice porridge is ready.

164
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,270
Sorry, but I'm not very hungry.

165
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,730
You won't get better if you don't eat. Eat, sweat, and sleep.

166
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,470
That's the best way to cure a cold.

167
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,730
Hey! Why are you eating and sweating?!

168
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,820
Shinpachi, I'm feeling kind of sick, too. What'll I do?

169
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,940
Will I have to put on a mask and eat rice porridge? This isn't good.

170
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,610
Don't lie!!

171
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,760
Come on... It's not fair that only Gin-chan gets to do this.

172
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,160
He gets to eat rice porridge and wear a mask.

173
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,770
It's like a party. I want to catch a cold.

174
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,700
You're an idiot. Go catch a cold. Catch a head cold.

175
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,290
Don't get cocky just because you caught a cold, moppy head.

176
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,750
I can catch a flu any time I want. Don't underestimate me.

177
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,570
She's an idiot. She's a real idiot.

178
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,330
Oh no. We had a job today.

179
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,360
[NOTE: 104º Fahrenheit]

180
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,360
That's a little impossible. You have a 40-degree fever.

181
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,830
We can't turn down a job.

182
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,770
I can't leave this to idiots who can't even catch a cold in wintertime.

183
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,200
Hey.

184
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,680
Wait. Why are you calling me an idiot?

185
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,290
Excuse me. I'm coming in. I requested a job the other day.

186
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,450
Excuse me...

187
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,300
Hey, hey, walking in without knocking? What an impolite client.

188
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,820
She pushed the intercom button.

189
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,500
What do you want? I'm Odd Jobs Gura-san.

190
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,700
What do I want? Umm... I'm Kawasaki. I asked you to find out if my husband was cheating on me.

191
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,230
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

192
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,480
Patsuan, pour her some tea.

193
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,350
Kagura-chan, don't act like that in front of our client.

194
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,570
She can barely see your face, too.

195
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,540
Shut up. He's always like this.

196
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,100
Gin-san corresponds with the clients.

197
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,540
Yeah, yeah. So you say...

198
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,700
So...

199
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,710
About the investigation...

200
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,110
You suspect that your husband is cheating on you?

201
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,190
Yes. There's no mistake.

202
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,130
Lately, he's been coming home late every day, and his clothes smell of women's perfume.

203
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,460
Ma'am, we can't assume he's been cheating solely on that evidence.

204
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:43,110
There are a lot of paranoid drama queens out there who act like tragic heroines like you.

205
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,020
Are you sure you're not imagining it?

206
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,130
Hey, hey!

207
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,400
Patsuan, I don't feel like taking this case. Can I go eat a parfait?

208
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,740
What are you saying?! Hey!!

209
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,610
That's what Gin-san would say, but why are you saying it?!

210
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,600
Hey!! You accepted my request over the phone yesterday!!

211
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,920
This is not what we agreed on.

212
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,490
I just don't like it.

213
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,970
You're speaking ill of these kids' father right in front of them.

214
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,450
He may be a good-for-nothing husband, but to them...

215
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,740
He's their precious dad.

216
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,700
W-Well...

217
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,890
It's Gin-san!! It's a mini Gin-san!!

218
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,530
We're only three minutes into Part B and she's already in lecture mode.

219
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,100
I didn't want to bring my children here!!

220
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,520
But my husband just keeps quiet when I ask him if he's been cheating.

221
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,030
I couldn't take it anymore, so I left...

222
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,480
I'm prepared to leave him!!

223
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,770
But he won't admit to the cheating or accept the divorce.

224
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,180
I want definitive proof that he was cheating!! If I do...

225
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,960
Sorry, but I'm going to have to turn you down.

226
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,230
We can't go looking for proof that'll take away their father from them.

227
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,410
Come on. Let's go, Patsuan.

228
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,600
Huh? Where?

229
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,480
We're going to find proof of his undying love...

230
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,110
Gura-san!!

231
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,980
Th-Thank you very much!!

232
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,410
This means so much to me.

233
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,890
Gura-san, this is great!!

234
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,650
It looks like we can do this even without Gin-san. Don't you think?!

235
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,820
Hey, hey, don't talk so much. You'll bite your tongue.

236
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,980
Gura-san!

237
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,600
Before we start working, why don't we go to a family restaurant?

238
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,380
My blood-sugar is low and I'm getting irritated.

239
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,670
Gura-san!

240
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,020
Come to think of it, JUMP goes on sale today.

241
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,190
Why don't we go to the convenience store?

242
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,170
Gura-san!

243
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,720
[Note: "Gurasan" is slang for "sunglasses" in Japanese.]

244
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,730
What's that thing that completely hopeless guy always wears?

245
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,720
Gura-san!

246
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,810
Gura-san, the client's husband apparently works at a place called the Kunoichi Cafe.

247
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,600
Let's secretly spy on him at his place of business first.

248
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,400
Affairs often start in the workplace.

249
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,920
Jeez. Humans are so pathetic and have no self-control...

250
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,290
But I want to believe in the bond of a married couple.

251
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,350
Gura-san, you're not Gin-san anymore. You're a completely different character.

252
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,800
But that's great, Gura-san!!

253

[Kunoichi Café]

254
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,030
Oh, Gura-san, that's the cafe.

255
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,190
Let's put some spirit into this, Patsuan.

256
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,400
We've got to prove that we can do this even if Gin-chan's not here.

257
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,860
Don't screw it up!!

258
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,840
Gura-san!!

259
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,710
Gura-san, Gin-san is irresponsible, but he usually parks safely.

260
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,960
Don't say his name. I don't want to live in his shadow anymore.

261
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,260
I'm going to live free...

262

Gura-san!! Who are you?! Who are you now?

263
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,150
Manager, there was an accident outside!!

264
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,220
Hey!

265
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,290
Did you do this?

266
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,560
Hey, call the police.

G-Gura-san, look.

269
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,010
Hey, come here, you two. You're minors, aren't you?

270
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,770
It's the client's husband. This is bad.

271
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,840
How are you going to take responsibility for this?

272
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,620
We can't secretly spy on him now. He's already noticed us.

273
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,090
Anyway, give me your home phone numbers. I'm going to contact your parents.

274
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,190
I forgot that a long time ago.

275
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,950
You forgot your own phone number?!

276
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,940
Oh well... What about your address?!

277
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,280
I think of all the land under this blue sky as my home.

I'm a lone monkey with the heart of a samurai.

Hey, you pig, nice rack. Gimme. Let me at 'em.

285
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,580
You really are Gin-san. You've gotten so small, but I can tell it's you.

Sachan-san, you need new glasses.

287

Why are you so small?

288
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,790
It happened because of this accident...

289
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,620
Now gimme some sugar, baby. Give those breasts to me.

290

Don't worry. I'll raise you on my breast milk! I'm all yours.

Gura-san, what are you doing?

295
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,900
Patsuan, you sure are dense.

296
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,370
You're not popular with the ladies because you don't understand the subtleties of love.

297
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,760
Huh?! Do you mean the client's husband is having an affair with Sachan-san?!

298
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,090
That's right!!

299
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:55,450
When I flirted with that sow, your husband fell for my trap.

300
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,060
He jumped in as if to say, "Don't touch those boobs. They're mine!"

301
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,690
I didn't say anything like that!!

Anyway, Michiko, what are you doing in a place like this?!

303

Don't act dumb.

304
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,930
Putting aside Michiko's jealousy, you're quite jealous about your lover.

What do you have to say about that?

306

Gura-san, don't you think you're making too many assumptions?

307
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,350
It's a little rash to presume they're having an affair simply because of that.

Honestly, it's an inconvenience to be caught up in this mess.

312
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,540
Aside from you, Gin-san, I think all men are scum.

313
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,770
I couldn't care less about them. Can't you see that, Gin-san?

314
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,070
Realize who you're talking to!!

315

316

Gin-chan never takes notice of you.

317
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,810
Since forcing yourself on him doesn't work,

318
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,250
you tried to get his attention by being indiscreet with that dirty man.

319
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,750
Forcing myself on him didn't work, so I tried to get his attention?

320
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,680
What is that? What kind of plan is that?

321

They say that when someone who's doggedly hung around you

322
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,820
suddenly pulls away, you feel sad and realize how important that person is.

323
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,800
You're so repulsive!! You already have three children.

326
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,070
You're jumping to conclusions!

327
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,830
I'm your mother, your [bleep], baby...

328
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,810
And so are you!!

329
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,610
C-Calm down!! Are you still suspicious about that?!

330
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,810
I wasn't having an affair with Sarutobi-san.

331
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,820
What do you mean?!

332
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,550
That just means...

333
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,470
You had an affair with someone other than Sarutobi-san.

334
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,490
Right, Sarutobi-san?

335
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,570
Come to think of it, he's been rather friendly with Waki-san.

336
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,190
Hey, Sarutobi-san, don't say anything like that!!

337
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,160
What do you mean, "friendly"?! Z?!! Is it Z?!! Anyway, what is Z?

338
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,960
Gura-san, it looked as if we were taking a detour,

339
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,500
but unexpectedly, we've gotten closer to the heart of the matter.

340
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,100
It's as I planned.

341
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,610
This is a plan to corner that man and make him spill everything.

342
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,980
Didn't you know that, Patsuan?

343
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,500
No. I didn't even want to get involved in this mess.

344
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,770
All we have to do now is catch that woman and make her confess in front of the client.

345
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,850
Sachan-san said that she was a coworker.

346
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,130
She's not working at the shop today.

347
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,960
She's helping out at her family's flower shop.

348
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,670
Men are always suckers for girls who work at flower shops or cake shops.

349
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,680
They sure are stupid.

350
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,090
It's as stupid as a kid who says he wants to work in a toy store when he's older.

351
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,800
But is this all right?

352
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,740
The client looked as if she didn't want to break up with her husband.

353
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,810
And, as you said, this is rough on the children... Is this really all right?

354
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,950
I wonder what Gin-san would do?

355

358
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,190
I didn't do anything.

359
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,600
Well, I understand.

360
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,800
With a wife like that, I can understand wanting to run away to another woman.

366

Hey, what went on here?

Listen, Zenzo, a dirty scooter suddenly crashed into the shop!

373

has been married to his wife for ten years.

377
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,780
He asked me to help make a picture out of flowers for his wife.

378
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,890
I was helping him make a portrait of his wife out of flowers. It was painstaking work.

379
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,070
He worked so hard, too.

That's because you like ugly women.

383

This is bad. I'd commit suicide if I received this.

What is that?! You spit in your own home.

386

You're pretty crafty. That's a pretty elegant thing to do. Tsk!!

387
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,550
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it sounded like you clucked your tongue.

388
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,730
You sounded so pleased when you thought I was cheating.

389
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,040
That means they might bring that portrait back with them.

390
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,970
They may not look it, but they're pretty considerate.

Really? I'm glad. I can finally show it to her.

392
