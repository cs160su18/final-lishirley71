00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,050
And so, graduation day is finally here. This is the last class.

3
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,080
[Once you graduate, you're an adult! In this episode, we'd like to introduce you to the world children cannot understand.]

[Anime and gambling are very similar. Either it's a big hit, or you lose your shirt.]

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,760
Kabukicho... Also known as the Town of Greed.

6
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,730
Many pleasures can be found in this town. Alcohol, women...

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,020
And drugs... There's nothing you can't get in this town.

8
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,570
And tonight, these men are about to seek challenges on a whole new stage.

9
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,850
Are you ready?

10
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,980
Yeah. Tonight, we'll say goodbye to a life of poverty.

11
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,890
We're gonna win! Until we get kicked out.

12
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,220
Damn it! I'm gonna win more money than I could ever spend!

13
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,970
And we'll celebrate with Dom Perignon mixed with Dom Perignon!

14
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,960
We'll drink until we have the runs!

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,350
Casino, here we come!

17
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,620
Is everyone ready?

18
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,280
Place your bets! Odds or evens! Place your bets!

19
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,930
Evens!

20
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,850
Odds!

21
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,230
Odds!

22
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,740
Odds!

23
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,360
Evens!

24
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,960
Boy, I'm glad it isn't winter. We'd be on the verge of freezing to death.

25
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,960
That's for sure. Although, it's winter in our wallets again.

26
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,970
We sure are lucky.

27
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,140
We sure are. The God of Poverty is definitely with us.

28
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,920
Now that I think about it, my left shoulder's been feeling awfully heavy lately.

29
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,880
Like there's someone on it... Like the God of Poverty.

30
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,620
Don't you think it's drooping a bit? My left shoulder?

31
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,620
You worry too much. If you look too desperate, even Lady Luck will avoid you.

32
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,810
Lately I keep seeing this creepy old man carrying a huge sickle.

33
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,570
But I've decided not to worry about him.

34
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,630
I think you should be worried.

35
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,640
See...? Speaking of the devil...

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,460
Huh?

37
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,640

Akuryotaisan! Youmakoufuku!

40
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,240
Eromuesaimu! Tekumakumayakon!

42
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,730
Look at you clowns. You either have it or you don't.

43
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,050
And you call yourselves gamblers.

44
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,380
Huh? These are...the clothes they won off us!

45
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,850
Who are you?

46
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,350
Luck's not a snack your grandma gives you.

47
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,000
If all you do is wait, Lady Luck won't come.

48
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,900
You have to seduce the goddess of gambling yourself.

49
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,410
He's amazing! He's been raking it in for a while now. Who is he?!

50
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,240
Hey, that scar on his face. He might be Kanbe, the Luck Reader.

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,510
"Luck reader"?

52
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,590
The unbeatable gambler with amazing luck.

53
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,820
A legend among gamblers! They say he can read how his luck's gonna run.

54
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,020
He can change all odds in his favor... He's every gambler's idol.

55
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,710
I heard he disappeared from Edo for a while.

56
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,070
But I never thought I'd get to see him in person!

57
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,730
Well, however legendary he is, I didn't know Lady Luck was such a whore.

58
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,420
Hell, I've been working my butt off to woo her and she didn't even glance at me.

59
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,650
She's probably not interested in married guys.

60
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,060
Hatsu went back to her hometown and hasn't come back.

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,350
You'd think she could forgive me for a one-night stand.

62
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,290
Maybe the goddess likes the wild type, like him.

63
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,230
Yeah, I'll bet she does. So I'll go wild too!

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,230
Odds or evens?

65
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,000
Evens!

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,950
Huh? What's wrong? Not wild enough maybe?

67
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,990
Can't I get more into the mood of "I don't give a damn"?

68
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,950
Hasegawa-san, take off your boxers.

69
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,370
Huh? Hey, I don't mind, but I'm not wild, y'know.

70
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,030
If anything, mine is more on the mild side.

71
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,950
What're you morons doing?!

72
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,610
And after everything I went through to get your clothes back!!

73
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,900
Are you stupid? Go home already! You're not suited to gambling!

74
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,380
You did it on your own. I don't remember asking you!

75
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,890
Or what? Could it be the trick to winning Lady Luck is to look shallow but be secretly generous?

76
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,000
You're so full of it. But you better watch your health.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,340
I'm not forcing myself to be kind!

78
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,020
There are two types of gamblers.

79
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,900
The first are guys who simply love to gamble.

80
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,030
The second type are guys who think they're cool when they gamble.

81
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,710
The second type makes crazy bets. He gets caught up in his own euphoria and destroys himself.

82
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,630
The better the gambler, the less extravagant the bets.

83
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,710
You don't go for it unless you know you can win.

84
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,150
You guys are obviously number two. Just take my advice and quit now.

85
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,150
We're not number two. We're number three.

86
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,430
There's no such thing.

87
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,980
Sure, there is. The kind who just really needs the money! The easy way.

88
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,150
So get a job!

89
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,260
Like you'd understand a laborer's feelings. Gamblers are frivolous.

90
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,840
You're wrong. Life is a gamble. We're all gamblers.

91
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,820
Shut up.

92
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,540
Anyway, a gambler shouldn't hang around in the sacred gambling hall in a pair of boxers.

93
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,800
I won't allow you to sully this place any further.

94
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,030
What a strange guy...

95
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,390
Huh?

96
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,370
Huh? How did this happened?!

97
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,320
Where'd I go wrong?

98
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,020
Hey, hey. Is it okay to dirty the sacred gambling hall with your loincloth?

99
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,530
Huh? You guys...!

100
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,000
On top of that, you sullied your name by cheating.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,160
What do you think, Hasegawa-san?

102
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,390
Trying to seduce Lady Luck with magic tricks? How pitiful. Totally pitiful.

103
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,150
And you're supposed to be a legendary gambler!

104
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,420
Humph... I told you. You have to create your own luck!

105
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,920
Hey, your cool dude act won't work. Not when you're only in a loincloth.

106
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,650
Well, bad luck sure seems to stick to you two.

107
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,420
It seems you took my good fortune too.

108
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,090
Aw, c'mon. Do us a favor.

109
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,460
Blast away this bad luck with your little tricks and help us make some money.

110
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,290
We won't say a word!

111
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,730
Gentlemen...

112
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,340
Please come with us.

113
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,910
Man. We never have any luck, do we?

114
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,750
So these are the scum who cheated in my gambling den.

115
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,190
You're pretty gutsy.

116
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,040
There's one ruler in Kabukicho and that's me, Kada the Princess Peacock.

117
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,460
Trying to outwit me? I hope you're prepared to die.

118
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,210
Hold it! Hold it! We didn't chea--!

119
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,930
I hate men who make excuses! And you call yourself a gambler?

120
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,480
Hey, hey. Talk about a goddess.

121
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,930
She's the female boss who controls most of the casinos in Kabukicho.

122
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,590
No one has ever escaped her shackles.

123
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,160
We're doomed to end up at the bottom of the ocean.

124
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,910
I wondered where I saw you... You're Kanbe. Kanbe, the "Luck Reader."

125
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:20,280
Hmm... So the legendary gambler of Edo turned out to be a mere cheater?

126
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,240
Your name had reached even my ears.

127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,880
A man who could read and change the course of luck even in the most dire situations.

128
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,040
That was long ago. Now, my eye has closed, and I can't read anything.

129
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,890
I'm just a rotten cheat.

130
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,610
Hmm... Your right eye may be closed, but it can still see luck...

131
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,130
Interesting.

132
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:48,170
Rumors say five years ago, you lost your right eye after losing a big match.

133
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,640
But surely, what your right eye can't see, your left eye can.

134
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,510
I shall give you one last chance.

135
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,260
This is...

136
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,910
It seems our last chance will be in mahjong.

137
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,230
Isn't it weird? Mahjong in a time slot featuring children's anime?

138
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,080
Shouldn't we be having an exciting challenge with something like Kurohige Kikiippatsu?

139
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,080
[Kurohige Kikiippatsu = Pop-up Pirate. A popular children's game in which you stick plastic swords into a barrel and try to eject Blackbeard the Pirate.]

140
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,720
Well, I'm sure there are all kinds of grown-up concerns like sponsors and things.

141
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,460
Mahjong, eh? I only know the basics.

142
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,280
Huh?!

143
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,880
H-Hasegawa-san, you...

144
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,920
Huh? What'd I do? Is there something on...

145
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,140
Huh?! What's this?! What's this? Why only me?! Huh?!

146
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,710
You're...!

147
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,800
You know him?

148
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,950
Janki Akage. The pro mahjong player for the Kada Gang.

149
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,090
He's gone twenty years without a single loss.

150
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,720
He's wasted guys named Dragon and Tiger one after another.

151
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,160
In the underworld,

152
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,690
he's a living legend.

153
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,890
Kanbe, the Luck Reader, knows about me? Now that's an honor.

154
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,750
We'll have a lot of fun today.

155
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,350
In other words, if we beat you, we can leave this place alive?

156
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:19,050
Right... If even just one of you beats me, all three of you can go free.

157
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,290
But if you lose...

158
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,560
...you'll become fish food in the bay of Edo!

159
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,660
What a farce...

160
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,060
Well, we have no choice, but to go along.

161
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,040
There's no other way to get out alive.

162
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,250
Still...what's that woman thinking?

163
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,980
I hear she loves gambling too.

164
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,450
She plans to enjoy watching us squirm.

165
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,190
What a detestable woman.

166
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay, shall we begin? This game of life?

167
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,100
[Note: The term used is "oya" = parent; which means "dealer" in the game]

168
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,100
Six to the right... well, you're the parent.

169
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,400
What?! What parent?! I don't remember having a naughty kid like you!!

170
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,610
Wha--? Huh?

171
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,950
This guy's eyes and his hand gestures... He's no ordinary guy.

172
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,130
Gin-san and I are the type who will never be loved by Lady Luck.

173
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,120
We have to let Mr. Luck Reader handle it.

174
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,100
Huh? Not again. What's with these losing tiles?!

175
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,860
What'll I do?! There's no way I can win with this!

176
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,700
That's why I didn't want to play. And I told you from the start.

177
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,700
Man, he's already talking like it's hopeless.

178
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,520
All right then. I guess it starts with me!

179
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,340
See?

180
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,070
Hey, you can't do that! You can't just throw away three tiles like that.

181
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,520
What? I can't? So what? I don't need them.

182
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,830
It's over. He doesn't know the rules. Help, someone! Please help us!

183
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,310
What a boner! The ones challenging me are total amateurs!

184
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,790
Fine, I'll let you do as you please, for a while.

185
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,230
So let's just continue like this.

186
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,340
This is impossible, I tell you...

187
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,900
Even if us three losers team up to beat you, we can't possibly win!

188
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,780
Hey, hey, what's the matter, Hasegawa-san?

189
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,120
The match has barely started.

190
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,880
Akage is being so kind. It's too early to throw in the towel.

191
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,510
Absolutely. Gambling isn't over until it's over.

192
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,210
I'm gonna shoot to win, my way!

193
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,660
Wh-What's with this baseless confidence?! But his eyes look unwavering.

194
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,320
Maybe something's gonna happen...

195
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,230
Mahjong!

196
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,500
SHOUSANGEN HONITSU HANEMAN.

197
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,350
I knew it was hopeless!! It's no good.

198
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,550
We didn't have a chance!

199
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,220
I was a fool to even think it for a second!

200
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,460
Now, now, don't get too dismayed.

201
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,960
This is just one game we lost.

202
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,220
That's right. We still have Mr. Luck Reader.

203
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,220
The man with amazing luck who can turn the tide!

204
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,570
Mahjong!!

205
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,650
Huh?

206
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,490
JUNCHANSANSHOKU OYAMAN.

207
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,290
Aww, come on! We can't! We can't win!

208
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:15,200
[Note: The following are all mahjong terms which lead to winning the game.]

209
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,160
Pong!

210
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,960
Chow!

211
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:10,860
Mahjong!

212
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,900
Kong!

213
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,080
Akari!

214
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,370
Reach!

215
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,190
Draw!!

216
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,950
KANPIN SANSHOKU DORADORA HANEMAN!

217
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,120
It's over. Each of you has zero points. Meaning you have nothing.

218
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,610
There's nothing you can bet with anymore.

219
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,900
Zero or nothing. So what?! A man doesn't win with points!

220
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,650
Hmm... Then what will you do?

221
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,980
Well, I'm not going to lose the next one.

222
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,790
Huh?! Strip mahjong?!

223
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,030
[Note: This refers to the yakuza movies of Tetsuya Watari and Ken Takakura]

224
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,030
Tet-chan and Ken-chan used to say in the old movies...

225
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,870
"When you lose, you lose your shirt."

226
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,810
Who are they?

227
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,970
Sounds like fun. Fine. Let's continue.

228
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,330
I'm already close to winning it all.

229
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,710
Huh?!

230
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,160
The most important thing for a gambler is guts.

231
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,080
He seems to be overflowing with that.

232
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,730
However, gambling is not so easy that you can win with just guts.

233
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,370
C-Calm down, you guys. One must not lose his cool, ever, in gambling.

234
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,510
Even if you are surrounded in flames, you must keep calm and concentrate.

235
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,300
I'm so cool my entire body is frozen!!

236
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,840
It's cold...

237
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,450
Well now, it seems you have nothing else to strip.

238
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,720
It's almost over. How boring.

239
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,160
I thought I could enjoy this a bit longer.

240
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,230
To think, this is all the Luck Reader had.

241
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:59,240
Playtime is over. Next, it's your life. Sorry, but I'm gonna settle this.

242
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,750
He's the legendary Janki, after all. He's in a different class from us. This is it...

243
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,420
Say mister, I wanted to ask you one thing.

244
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,460
When your right eye was still good, were you really able to see luck?

245
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:28,230
He probably cheated. But relax. I'll be the legend from today on.

246
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,600
Shut up! You be quiet!

247
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:37,090
Hah! If I could see luck, I wouldn't be one-eyed today.

248
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,250
Kanbe, your man did a terrible thing. How will you settle this?!

249
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,020
There's one thing I can say...

250
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,360
By the way, Kanbe. I hear you have a very interesting right eye.

251
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,930
That you can read luck.

252
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,930
I've always made choices I didn't regret.

253
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,810
Smash it. If you want him to live, gouge out that right eye!

254
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:13,990
I've always done as I pleased. In gambling and in life.

255
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,500
Humph, and this is the result?

256
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,550
In essence, a cheater, that's all you were. And I'll prove it right now!

257
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,250
You're mine! Now I'll stop their breathing.

258
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,800
Reach!

259
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,370
Mahjong!!

260
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,380
Atari.

261
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,760
[Note: chiitoitsu = seven pairs]

262
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,760
CHIITOITSU. Damn right! He's got it!

263
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,180
Wh-What?! How?! I thought you didn't even know the rules!

264
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,720
No, I don't. That's why I moved as I pleased.

265
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,060
I just realized that I had completed my tiles.

266
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,520
Besides, I don't like you.

267
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,070
As long as you don't beat me, I don't give a damn about the rest.

268
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,190
Th-That's so ridiculous...

269
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,940
He really is ridiculous. But just now, the current of Luck changed.

270
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,270
Let's go, mister.

271
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,240
The counter move begins!

272
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,720
[Note: Dragon Punch refers to a term in the Drxxon Ball anime]

273
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,720
MENTANPIN Dragon Dragon Punch!

274
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,940
[Note: "Release" refers to a term in the Naxxto anime]

275
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,940
TONNANSHAPEI RINSHAN Release!!

276
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,480
Taihai! Shanpai! Chonbo! Furiken! Noten! Mopai!

277
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,680
Double East Double South Double Reach Kick!!

278
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,950
We're no small fries! We just ain't!

279
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,160
Now we're all naked. Let's settle it with the next game.

280
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,900
I can't lose. She doesn't permit losing.

281
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,010
If I lose now, I'll be killed.

282
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,490
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

283
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,650
Whatever it takes!

284
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,040
I guess I underestimated you guys. But this is it.

285
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,640
I'll finish you off with this one deal.

286
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,800
I'll send both you and Kanbe to hell!

287
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,070
I can't change my strategy now.

288
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,720
But I still have a trick or two left.

289
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,880
Sorry, but you're gonna have to disappear!

290
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,720
Lethal weapon! Giant Tiger Illusion Tiles!

291
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,280
I can pull 1000 tiles per second! No way you can see my moves!

292
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,860
Oh sorry... I was sitting for so long, my legs started to hurt.

293
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,090
It wasn't on purpose. No really.

294
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:44,060
Oh man, this is terrible. Let's put the tiles back. I'll help.

295
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,490
S-Stop!

296
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,770
No, it's nothing.

297
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,780
Damn! A few of the tiles ended up in the wrong position.

298
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,040
Especially that row they piled back up.

299
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,430
I have to get it back!

300
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,100
It's all right. I'll just delay a few of my moves.

301
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,010
Here I come!

302
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,570
Bring it on!

303
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,510
Huh?!

304
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,610
Huh? What's this called? Hey, I just...

305
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,390
I'm the dealer, so I was about to get rid of a tile and...look. It's all in place.

306
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,240
See... They're all paifu tiles.

307
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,660
That doesn't matter. If you've reached haipai...

308
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,180
Heaven's hand?

309
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,510
Good fortune bestowed upon man by Heaven.

310
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,590
Huh?! Heaven's hand?! Impossible! How can that be?!

311
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,710
So at the end of the end, Lady Luck had a one night stand with me!

312
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,770
You did it, Hasegawa-san! I always knew you were someone who could do it!

313
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,060
How can this happen?! Where did I go wrong?

314
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,980
I feel like my life has changed. Maybe Lady Luck will love me forever.

315
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,110
Hah! That's life.

316
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,550
Say Gin-san, let's go celebrate before Lady Luck turns away from me.

317
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,530
Sounds good. How about we splurge on Dom Perignon with Dom Perignon?

318
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,900
Take it easy...

319
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,140
You're hopeless.

320
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,100
That's why gambling is...

321
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:12,030
[Thank you for your support this past year.]

322
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,940
[Please continue to watch.]

323
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:25,140
Everyone, repeat one year.

324
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,470
Anyway, you guys have to repeat the grade. So come to class another year!

325
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,540
Gin Tama begins another year!

326
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,670
But before that, there's something to do!

327
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,950
[After overcoming a reorganization, there's a new ordeal?]

328
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:40,090
[What happens to Gin Tama has not been determined yet. This is not a final decision.]
