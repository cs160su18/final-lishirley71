00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,850
As you all know, Toshi was born after
I laid my hands on the demonic sword.

3
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,240
A Toshiro Hijikata with his pathetic otaku
characteristics amplified by the curse.

4
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,730
Yes, he isn't a different
personality I created.

5
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,530
He's the real Toshiro Hijikata.

6
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,100
I chose to face him head-on and talk.

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,210
"I don't want to disappear without
accomplishing anything.

8
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,100
I want to leave proof of my existence."

9
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
That's what he said.

10
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,730
This is Toshi's dream.

11
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,920
My way of paying tribute to the departure
of the one I gave birth to.

12
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,130
I will master the way of the otaku!

13
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,390
I will become the greatest otaku!

14
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,990
I will unite all otaku and become
the king of otaku!

15
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,890
And etch proof of his existence into
this world...into people's hearts!

16
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,350
Die!

17
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,900
["The Black Ships Even Make
a Scene When They Sink"]

18
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,740
Spectacular!

19
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,350
Mr. Shimura has made peace between KIM the
bass player and KIYOSHI the drum player!

20
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:14,670
Their session has doubled the attack points of Mr.
Toshi's strong attack and reflected it back at him!

21
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,080
Now!

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,410
Now is my chance!

23
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
Go!

24
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,320
Mr. Toshi's life points are dropping fast!

25
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,910
Is this the end?!

26
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,530
I'm losing...

27
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,270
I'll lose at this rate...

28
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,630
That's enough...

29
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,240
That's enough, Toshiro...

30
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,900
Let me handle the rest.

31
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,920
Let me finish this!

32
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,360
Y-You...

33
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880
That's...

34
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,870
Wow!

35
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,410
What's going on?!

36
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,350
The energy reflected by Mr. Shimura
is expanding before Mr. Toshi!

37
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,180
Expanding larger and larger!

38
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,840
The light is not fading!

39
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,650
This is...

40
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,900
This card is...!

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,980
Dizon.

42
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,840
A sudden announcement in the middle of a concert
that she's pregnant and getting married.

43
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:27,940
[Note: Refers to idol Leah Dizon who made
such an announcement during her concert.]

44
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,940
The worst possible card which negates
all audience, enemy, and ally cards.

45
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,490
Please don't ditch me.

46
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,060
Th-This is...!

47
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,560
A draw!

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,230
Both sides collapsed in the
ring without budging!

49
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,780
Shinpachi!

50
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,290
Toshi!

51
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,490
Vice-Chief!

52
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,320
What a grand battle!

53
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,940
The final contest has ended
without an overall victor!

54
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,580
Their desire to win and
love for Otsu-chan

55
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,450
could not be fully measured
in such a match?!

56
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,590
How do we call this contest?!

57
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,720
Otsu-chan, what do we do?!

58
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,720
There is no need...

59
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,220
To call this contest.

60
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,330
Because this contest isn't over yet!

61
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,390
Th-They're up!

62
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,700
Both have stood up with zero life points!

63
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,290
Yet they still continue to fight!

64
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,990
Shinpachi!

65
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,740
Toshi!

66
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,370
Zero life points!

67
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,540
They're both beat up!

68
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,140
Neither side has any cards in their hand!

69
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,960
Yet they still stand!

70
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,340
Yet they still...!

71
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,090
Continue to fight!

72
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,320
They're engaged in a literal
blow by blow match!

73
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,720
Will they only stop fighting when
their lives have burned out?!

74
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,550
Stop!

75
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,630
Please!

76
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,250
Stop already!

77
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,620
It's too dangerous to continue!

78
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,850
Why do you have to go so far
for the title of official fan club?!

79
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,980
Enough already!

80
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,960
I'll make both teams my official fan clubs!

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,860
So stop!

82
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,650
Please!

83
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,710
Somebody stop them!

84
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,930
They're going to kill each
other at this rate!

85
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,380
It's useless.

86
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,550
It's useless now.

87
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,250
Nobody can stop them.

88
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,300
They are no longer fighting to
become the official fan club.

89
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,170
It's funny.

90
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,590
I'm in so much pain...

91
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,760
It hurts so much...

92
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,000
Yet, this is the first time
I've ever felt so alive!

93
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,910
Hijikata-san...

94
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,020
No... Toshi!

95
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,910
So you noticed, Mr. Shinpachi?

96
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,850
I wouldn't be standing here if I'd taken
a straight punch from Hijikata-san.

97
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,920
Why?

98
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,350
If you had let Hijikata-san handle this,

99
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,550
you could have easily won.

100
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,830
Why now?!

101
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,280
I could ask the same of you, Mr. Shinpachi.

102
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:42,220
After hearing Otsu-chan's voice,
why do you still not lower your fists?

103
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,380
Why do you still fight?!

104
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,130
Proof of my existence...

105
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,580
That is what I have sought with Toshiro...

106
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,680
I mastered the way of the otaku...

107
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:15,740
But I suppose that I never really cared
about becoming lord over all otaku.

108
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:34,760
I may have just wanted to completely
lose myself in one task.

109
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,190
I may have just wanted to fight with
everything I had, alongside my friends.

110
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,440
With my rivals...

111
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,450
Mr. Shinpachi, you're the same.

112
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,540
There is no need for any proof.

113
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,790
There is no need to create any.

114
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,930
We just have to live every
second to the fullest!

115
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:19,260
And the traces of the path we lived
will be burned into the ground...

116
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,600
That will serve as proof of our existence!

117
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,990
Both sides have simultaneously
been knocked out!

118
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,670
Toshi, that's crazy...

119
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:10,720
After coming so far to be
rid of him, why now...?

120
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,230
It doesn't matter.

121
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,080
Huh?

122
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,680
It no longer matters.

123
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,130
Get up!

124
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,560
Get up, Toshi!

125
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,600
It doesn't matter if you win or lose!

126
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,540
Stand up and fight to the very end!

127
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,870
Fight until you're completely burned out

128
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,970
so your memory remains
engraved in our minds!

129
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,820
Get up!

130
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,970
Toshi!

131
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,490
Stand up!

132
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,830
Patsuan!

133
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,720
What are you burning out for?!

134
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,220
You're going to let this end
in such a small flame?!

135
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,750
Stupid four-eyes!

136
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,130
You won't be able to rest in peace
if your body's still warm!

137
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,310
Stand up!

138
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,500
Patsuan!

139
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,720
Burn everything up!

140
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,410
Send that bastard to the next world!

141
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,230
Th-This is...

142
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,060
Yeah! Stand up!

143
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,450
Don't give up!

144
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,300
Do your best, guys!

145
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,410
Both sides are struggling to their feet!

146
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,500
And...!

147
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,890
The entire arena is cheering them on!

148
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,940
As their battle transcends
victory and interests,

149
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,000
they are now being cheered on
by both enemies and allies!

150
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,820
I'll also cheer for them!

151
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,410
Stand up, you two!

152
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,310
This show's almost out of time!

153
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,290
Mr. Shinpachi.

154
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,820
I'm glad to have met a rival
like you in the end.

155
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,750
Thank you, Mr. Shinpachi.

156
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,460
Thank you, everyone.

157
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,070
Thank you...

158
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,880
Toshiro...

159
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,230
Such a strange feeling...

160
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,160
To see someone paying their
respects to their own picture.

161
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,660
Hey, Yamazaki.

162
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,760
I told you to change the picture.

163
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,710
This picture was when I was
pretending to be Toshi.

164
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,830
Switch it to a picture of the real Toshi.

165
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,910
Does it even matter?

166
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,800
You look the same.

167
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,550
Don't give me that crap.

168
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,050
What if he comes back again?

169
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,350
Take good care of the flowers, too.

170
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,530
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,700
Did you hear anything about what
happened to them afterwards?

172
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,220
The fan club?

173
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,720
Thanks to a certain someone, they're
still scraping by with a few people.

174
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,220
Though former members
are starting to return.

175
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,770
What do you mean?

176
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,030
They didn't become the official fan club?

177
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,420
The members should have rushed back
in droves when they became official.

178
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,420
Well...

179
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,380
They said something about how there's nothing
official or unofficial about cheering for Otsu-chan

180
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,320
and gave up the title.

181
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,260
Hey!

182
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,840
Louder!

183
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,140
Don't be wusses!

184
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,520
You need more guts if you're
gonna love Otsu-chan!

185
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,360
And they even left this behind.

186
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,810
That bastard's trying to be all cool!

187
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,590
Where are you going, Vice-Chief?

188
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,700
Isn't it obvious?!

189
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,290
I refuse to stay in their debt!

190
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,390
I'll personally return the former
members to the fan club!

191
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,710
Are you going to pretend to be
Toshi and gather otaku again?

192
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,990
It'll be hard to pay back this debt.

193
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,280
Still, this gives us a perfect
picture to use.

194
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,280
The eternally missing member.

195
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,100
You can brag all you want in the afterlife.

196
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,040
Toshi.

197
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,320
Tsu Terakado's new single!

198
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,050
Your Granny's Wearing
Your Basketball Shoes!

199
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,080
Selling great in the anime!

200
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,670
Gin-san, it's terrible!

201
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,410
Some impostors have shown
up using the Odd Jobs name!

202
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,240
What's that?!

203
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,570
That's so cliché!

204
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,240
Cliché to the max! Unforgivable!

205
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,170
The next episode...

206
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,890
"That Matsutake Soup Stuff Tastes Better
Than The Real Deal, Plus One."

207
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,890
[Man cannot come back to life once dead.
But, there's another subtitle.]

208
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,900
[Someone suddenly comes into
Shinpachi's lone Odd Jobs...]

209
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,370
Okay, the two King Kongers are next.

210
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,550
H-Hey, Gin-san!

211
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,780
The King Kong program ended in spring.

212
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,650
Huh?

213
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,560
Hey, now. Hold on.

214
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,740
I didn't hear anything about that.

215
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,730
That show ended?

216
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,100
Yep.

217
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,930
Starting in April, they're
airing Pirameki at 6:30.

218
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,370
Hey, tell me these things sooner.

219
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,170
I've totally embarrassed myself.

220
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,830
How could I screw up so badly?

221
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,480
Then give me another try. From the top.

222
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,890
Okay, the two Hannya
members are next.

223
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,890
No, Gin-san.

224
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,250
That's not the issue here.

225
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,720
You've got it completely wrong.

226
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,030
Huh?

227
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,030
Hey, now.

228
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,990
Hold on.

229
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,570
Give me a break already.

230
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,530
What did I screw up?

231
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,480
Well, it's only...

232
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,430
6:23.

233
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,990
It's not time for GinTama to end yet.

234
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,020
We have too much time left over.

235
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,120
That's right.

236
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
And after we managed to end that
long arc in a nice fashion...

237
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,390
What the hell?

238
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,190
Can't do anything about that. Besides, the
fourth year of GinTama was unreasonable.

239
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,310
"Wait! Let's just make thirty minutes worth
of anime from one week's worth of JUMP.

240
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,030
Then we won't catch up to the manga.

241
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,530
Tag on some extra segments.

242
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,370
[Note: Refers to the Japanese
pop/R&B band known as EXILE.]

243
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,370
And add a bunch of extras
to EXILE while we're at it."

244
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,610
The staff totally didn't think this through.

245
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,690
The last one was completely unrelated.

246
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,040
And they aren't extras!

247
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,600
So what are we going to do?

248
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,630
Are we going to keep talking?

249
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,810
Are we going to keep whining
about the budget?

250
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,760
Besides, that one sponsor has been...

251
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,380
I told you to stop talking about
issues like money on TV!

252
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,010
That's not the point!

253
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,080
We have five minutes left over

254
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,580
so can't we do something extra?

255
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,040
We can't spend the entire
five minutes like this.

256
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,160
We have to do something new
to please the audience.

257
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,540
Are you an idiot?

258
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,200
By definition, an extra isn't going
to please the audience.

259
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,100
Hell, after the extras put
them at 14 members...

260
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,070
Stop talking about EXILE!

261
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,290
Gin-chan, I'm thirsty so I'm
gonna go get a drink.

262
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,430
Move on to some kind of new extra
corner by the time I get back.

263
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,500
Gotcha.

264
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,070
You have an extra to use?

265
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,900
Sure.

266
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,970
Oh. Tell me sooner.

267
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,850
Or just start with that.

268
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,720
Well, it's a new extra corner,

269
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,440
so I wanted to save it for next week
when the new ending hits.

270
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,300
Yeah, I don't think this is
the time to be saving up.

271
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,480
You think?

272
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,850
Then I'll give it a try.

273
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,510
New Extra Corner!

274
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,170
Feeling all beat by 6 PM.

275
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,780
Everything's still all good.

276
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,270
Getting all bitchy by 6 PM.

277
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,940
Tomorrow will be all good.

278
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,310
Okay. We're back again this week.

279
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,980
A special edition of "Smile! Is That Good?."

280
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,150
Then we'll start with the first Tamo-san commercial
that wasn't shown during the broadcast.

281
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,860
What the hell?!

282
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,370
Special edition?! This is just a recap!

283
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,960
A recap of an extra segment!

284
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,470
Who benefits from this?!

285
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,490
Besides, "Smile! Is That Good?."

286
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,000
was supposed to be a special
corner which featured friends

287
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,480
who hadn't been on screen in a while
to make the audience happy!

288
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,500
And before we knew it, it turned into
a corner for Tamo-san to play dumb.

289
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
That's right!

290
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,550
That could no longer be
considered a detour!

291
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,480
He was headed in a completely
different direction!

292
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,280
Who's going to buy DVDs
to see Tamo-san?!

293
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,430
Who cares?

294
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,260
Some viewers were watching because
they thought it was "Go Ahead."

295
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,530
Nobody would think that!

296
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,870
I'm back.

297
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,360
Did you use up the rest of the
time, incombustible waste?

298
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,200
Well, Patsuan here didn't like
the content of my extra.

299
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,710
Who would?

300
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,920
There's no need to do anything
with the content of an extra.

301
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,290
Just go with the standard.

302
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,710
If you use the original plan and

303
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,920
introduce popular characters who
don't get much screen time,

304
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,910
you'll hook the audience.

305
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,350
Don't use words like hook!

306
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,700
So would a standard extra be like this?

307
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,810
Soul Reaper Encyclopedia Silver!

308
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:49,490
Okay, we'll be introducing some
more Soul Reapers this week.

309
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,520
The Soul Reaper who was trying
to take Taka-chin's soul.

310
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,560
His favorite food is apples.

311
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,170
He weighs seven apples.

312
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,760
And...

313
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,330
There's no end to the problems
I could name!

314
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,400
It's a blatant rip-off from
the very beginning!

315
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,210
Yeah, but you said to
introduce characters...

316
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,580
Who wants you to introduce
an ordinary Soul Reaper?!

317
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,260
And why is he obsessed with apples?!

318
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,530
Even Ryuk could control himself better!

319
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,530
[Note: Refers to Ryuk from Death Note.]

320
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,680
I thought that would be a standard extra.

321
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,840
The content was anything but!

322
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,150
Hey, you done griping, contact lenses?

323
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,300
You mean Four-Eyes!

324
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,860
Fine. Fine.

325
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,450
I'll give up on introducing characters.

326
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,110
We'll use a different kind
of standard extra.

327
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,540
So what do you have in mind?

328
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,110
This would be as standard as you get.

329
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,360
A corner for illustrations
from all the viewers!

330
00:23:36,720 --> 00:24:05,040
[Illustration Corner]

331
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,650
This is super standard.

332
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,960
I'd feel a lot better if you just made
everything audience participation.

333
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,290
Let's move to the first letter.

334
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,790
A postcard from Hiroko Aoki, four years old,
from Kanagawa prefecture.

335
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,680
I tried my best to draw my
favorite scene in GinTama.

336
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,260
Please use it.

337
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,680
That's nice.

338
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,040
A four-year-old, huh?

339
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,410
It puts a smile on my face.

340
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,720
It must be an adorable illustration.

341
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,890
Here it is.

342
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:19,930
[Hiroko Aoki-chan (4 years old)]

343
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,150
Hell no!

344
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,370
A four-year-old would never
have chosen this scene!

345
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,980
This was obviously planted!

346
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,880
How could the fake DVD jacket from the fourth
year announcement be a classic scene?!

347
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,060
Shinpachi.

348
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,250
What?!

349
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,640
We're out of time.

350
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,940
[We were planning to fill thirty minutes
with randomness next week...]

351
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,820
[How about we let the fourth season of
GinTama steamroll in and air tomorrow?

352
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:35,310
[See you next time.]
