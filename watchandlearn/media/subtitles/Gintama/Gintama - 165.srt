00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,970
[Live-Action GinTama!]

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,960
[Up next!!]

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,690
Man...

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,090
After making it to our fourth year,

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,420
I've gotten to the point where I want to
throw up every week in April, y'know?

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,800
Next thing I know,
one cours is up and done.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,800
[Note: One cours refers to three months
of scheduling. In practice, 13 episodes.]

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,570
We managed to continue on despite
all the pain and suffering.

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,000
We had to walk home from the station
while holding in a big one,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,690
but we somehow managed to make
it out of the shopping district.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,750
But y'know...

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,150
It's a long ways getting home
from the shopping district.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,740
I wanted to give up when
we passed by the park.

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,530
The whole "Just use a public bathroom"
idea started to sound pretty tempting.

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,310
Oh, not that there's anything wrong
with using a public bathroom.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,090
But it's all about overcoming the temptation
and reaching the washlet bathroom at home.

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,950
Right, Shinpachi?

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,310
Huh?

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,060
Gin-san? Is that Gin-san?

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,290
That's right.

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,180
It's Gin-san.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,920
Uh, what is this?

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,690
What do you mean?

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,410
This is GinTama.

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,730
Same GinTama time. Same GinTama channel.
The same old GinTama.

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,590
Uh, doesn't this seem a little different?

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,710
Oh, is this live-action?!

30
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,520
When did GinTama turn
into a live-action show?!

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,010
What?! They're mannequins?!

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,650
Ah, I thought someone told you.

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,390
We're going to become an anime
that transcends anime.

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,660
Starting this week, we'll be showing
"Live-action GinTama Revolution:

35
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,420
Love will save Hollywood."

36
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,420
[Note: Parody of the movie
"Dragon Ball Evolution."]

37
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,420
We are not!

38
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,390
[Note: Parody of the movie "Titanic."]

39
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,390
This will leave Shueisha in Titanic status!

40
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,720
A surreal world anime with thirty
minutes of talking mannequins.

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,420
"Oh! Gintamikey."

42
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,420
[Note: Parody of mannequin comedy show
"Oh Mikey!" aka "The Fuccons."]

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,720
No, this can't be considered
anime anymore.

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,810
These are just still-frame photos!

45
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,910
Well, this is basically what happened.

46
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,140
We tried a number of different detours
and then someone said

47
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,620
"Ah, that's right. We haven't
tried doing live-action yet."

48
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,330
So we're doing this on
the whim of the staff.

49
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,670
Got it, Shinpachi?

50
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,680
Seriously?

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,110
[Note: Parody of 20th Century Fox.]

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,110
I was expecting 20th Century
Box to show up behind us.

53
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,270
Right, Shinpachi?

54
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,270
Geez, why do you purposely
take these risks?

55
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,340
It's pretty damn scary.

56
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,070
You're such a spoilsport, Shinpachi.

57
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,560
That's why you can never
stop being Shinpachi.

58
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,990
Learn your lesson already, Shinpachi.

59
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,260
Uh, what's that even supposed to mean?

60
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,850
And why am I just a pair of glasses?!

61
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,520
Okay, it's starting to rain,

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,140
so we'll move indoors.

63
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,550
This show is pretty damn random.

64
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,000
We're going to visit Sunrise's fifth studio
where they make the GinTama anime.

65
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,880
Excuse us, murder license.

66
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,880
[Note: Parody of manga "Murder License Kiba".
Shueisha title serialized in Super Jump.]

67
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,780
Oh. This is where they make
the GinTama anime.

68
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,220
Looks like a dirty place.

69
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,750
This is what is known as the
modern-day sweatshop.

70
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,660
No, it isn't!

71
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,590
Don't ruin their reputation!

72
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,220
What if everybody believes you?!

73
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,180
There isn't much difference.

74
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,780
This is a modern-day sweatshop.

75
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,270
Cancer Beam!

[Note: Parody of GUNDAM W.
anime created by Sunrise.]

77
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,920
There's no cancer or
beam involved here.

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,630
The boss is going to be pissed at you!

79
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,130
Uh, Kagura-chan?

80
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,760
What's with the horns on your head?

81
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,820
They're antennas.

82

Starting today, I'm the digital conversion
mascot, Digi-Kagura.

84
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,810
That's a complete rip-off!

85
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,080
Okay. Then I'll pitch in.

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,310
Don't take your clothes off!

87
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,760
What the hell is this scene?!

88
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,880
This is nowhere near acceptable
for showing on TV!

89
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,590
Then we'll move on to today's main topic.

90
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:47,150
All analog broadcasting will end in July of
2011 and switch to digital broadcasting.

91
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,140
After that, analog televisions without a digital
tuner will be unable to receive a signal.

92
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,530
There you have it.

93
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,840
Huh?

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,750
That's it?

95
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,250
This was just another digital
TV ad, wasn't it?

96
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,840
Why do I have to catch
a cold this time of year?

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,230
I'm completely out of sync
with the rest of the world.

98
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,330
[Note: "15 no Yoru" (Night at 15)
is a Yutaka Ozaki song.]

99
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,330
Is my body in 15 no Yoru or what?

100
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,720
I feel like I'm racing along
on a stolen motorcycle.

101
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,720
[Note: A lyric from "15 no Yoru"(Night at 15).
A song about an unruly teenager"s life.]

102
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
Hello.

103
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,340
Are you okay, Gin-san?

104
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,960
Honestly...

105
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,690
How could you catch a
cold this time of year?

106
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,430
Hell if I know.

107
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,770
My body went off and picked up some hitchhiking
germs from who knows where.

108
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,440
Y'know?

109
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,640
Since my body's all kind and considerate.

110
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,300
Don't let that hitchhiking
germ spread to me.

111
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,650
In any case, a cold in this
season can be a real pain.

112
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,580
You have to take good care of
yourself or you won't get better.

113
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,840
Gin-chan.

114
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,880
I made some rice porridge.

115
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,600
Eat this and get better soon.

116
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,400
No, he's going to be feeling a different
kind of sick if he eats all that.

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,290
That isn't even a normal portion size.

118
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,370
Guess I have no choice then.

119
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,570
I'll help out.

120
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you sure you don't just
want to eat it yourself?!

121
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,770
This just sucks.

122
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,430
I feel so crappy that I don't
even care anymore.

123
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,650
How can you say that after a little cold?

124
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,300
Think back.

125
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,990
That newtype influenza was much worse.

126
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,780
Influenza?

127
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,310
That's right.

128
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,170
This cold is nothing compared to that.

129
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,380
Yes... Compared to that...

["If It Works Once, It'll Work Over and Over Again"]

131

[Winter]

132
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,780
The current outbreak of influenza in Edo

133
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,820
is believed to be a newtype
virus from Planet Onishi.

134
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,820
[Note: Onishi was the first GinTama manga editor.]

135
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,920
We expect the outbreak to
get extensively worse.

136
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,640
Everyone please take care of yourselves.

137
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,700
Sis, I'm coming in.

138
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,270
Yes...

139
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,430
It's starting to snow.

140
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,790
We'll probably have some accumulation.

141
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,470
Are you okay, Sis?

142
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,700
Let me know if you're cold.

143
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,780
I made some rice porridge.

144
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,720
Eat plenty so you get better soon.

145
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,730
Th-Thanks, Shin-chan.

146
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,430
I'll be fine now,

147
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,100
so go to work.

148
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,210
Ah, it's fine.

149
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,120
I just called and he was like,

150
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,100
"You're probably infected already so
don't bother coming, you sicko."

151
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,210
Honestly, that Gin-san...

152
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,220
It's so terrible of him to call you a sicko.

153
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,450
They were probably trying
to be considerate.

154
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,040
That's not possible.

155
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,990
There probably isn't any work.

156
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,760
I'll take the day off.

157
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,850
I also let "Hostess Club Smile" know
that you'd be taking the day off.

158
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,850
I can look after you the entire day.

159
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,960
But it would be terrible

160
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,030
Don't worry.

161
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,780
It's my turn to take care of you.

162
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,870
You look kind of happy.

163
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,970
Ah, uh... Sorry.

164
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,270
That's not it.

165
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,330
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,590
It's disrespectful to feel this
way when you're suffering.

167
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:05,730
It's just that, well, we haven't had a chance
to be alone like this in a while.

168
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,780
I-I'm really sorry.

169
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,370
Honestly, you're so hopeless, Shin-chan.

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,920
Then I guess I'll depend on you today.

171
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,100
Will you listen to my whims?

172
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,420
Y-Yes!

173
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,510
You can ask for anything!

174
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,320
I'll do it all.

175
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,970
Ah, then I'll go get some more water!

176
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,140
It's dangerous to run.

177
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,780
I'll be right back so sit tight.

178
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,690
Yes? Eh?

179
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,330
I caught a cold.

180
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,830
It hurts...

181
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,410
My head is splitting...

182
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,840
I'll probably...

183
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,420
I'll probably feel better if I
eat some rice porridge...

184
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,570
No, you gotta add egg.

[Note: Takuan is a traditional Japanese
pickle made from daikon radish.]

Pretty sure I won't get better without
rice porridge with egg and takuan...

187
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,380
Uh, why did you come all
the way to my place?

188
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,540
Shouldn't you rest at
home if you're sick?

189
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,010
Why did you come here?

190
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,210
Don't be so cold.

191
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,840
Neither of us can move.

192
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,760

of jesters have been paralyzed.

Jesters?

196

That's a strange analogy,

to gather at our house?!

These people are sick in a different way!

267
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,620
Their way of life is fundamentally sick!

268
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,810
That's right!

269
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,470
I'm infected by the disease
known as Gin-san!

270
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,140
I can't leave him, until death do us part!

271
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,350
What?!

272
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,940
That means I'm infected by an incurable
disease called Otae-san!

273
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,010
I won't be able to leave
her after I'm dead!

274
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,100
Couldn't you people at least
pretend to deny it?

275

Shin-chan...

276
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,600

277
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,070

the same boat now.

Yes, Otae-san.

280
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,350
Let's work hard together, Otae-san!

281
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,880
We'll get better and run around
the fields like we used to!

282
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,630
When did that ever happen?

283
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,460
There's a folk remedy I'd like to try.

284
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,370
It involves this green onion...

285
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,690
Ah, green onions are supposed to be
effective against coughs and phlegm.

286
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,000
My mom wrapped one around
my throat when I was a kid.

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,850
So what are we going to do?

288
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,800
Otae-san! How much longer
do I have to keep this up?!

289
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Until your fever's gone
and you're frozen stiff.

290
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,170
Sis, he's going to die.

291
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,670
That should help clear up the air.

292
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,730
But the air's too dry.

293
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,000
The virus is going to multiply.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,450
That's it.

295
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,160
I'll water the yard.

296
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,150
Otae-san?!

297
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,890

298
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,290

Hey...

300
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,340
Could you shut the door?

301
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,420
It's cold.

302
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,580
I can't stop shivering.

303
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,350
Oh, you're cold?

304
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,190
Then I'll sleep with you.

305
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,910
Huh?

306
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,340
You're supposed to lie naked
together when it's cold.

307
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,100

Y-You can't!

311
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,050
Not that I don't want to...

312
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,440
But you can't!

313
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,710
Not here!

314
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,680
They're all watching!

315
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,120
This... This...

316
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,720
Makes me so excited!

317
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,840

318
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,880
Do whatever you want!

319

Shinpachi, don't let any
more sick people in.

320
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,740
Uh... That was really important to me...

321
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,540
Th-That's...!

322
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,110
A large amount of virus is sneaking
in through the door cracks!

323
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,630
O-Otae-chan...

324
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,430
I'm here to see how you're doing...

325
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,330
Now we have someone whose very existence
could be considered a virus!

326
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,400
Huh?

327
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,580
Oh? What's this?

328
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,450
You guys are here, too?

329
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,350
What's this?

330
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,160
You're all sick together?

331
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,310
Honestly...

332
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,710
You're such a weak bunch.

333
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm used to living on the streets,
that's why I'm fine as you can see.

334
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,960
What the hell?!

335
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,000
You just threw up blood!

336
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,740
You've got something worse than a cold!

337
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,830
As you can see, I'm just fine.

338
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,350
I don't feel cold at all when
I'm practically naked.

339
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,630
He's wearing the virus.

340
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,450
He's posing with the virus
like it's a winter trend!

341
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,180
This is just a small token,

342
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,770
but please eat it together and get better.

343
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,870
It's a Nagoya delicacy...

344
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,430
What is this stuff covering the Uiro?!

345
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,430
[Note: Uiro is a steamed cake from Nagoya.]

346
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,990
Are you trying to poison us?!

347
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,250
We appreciate the thought,

348
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,080
now scram.

349
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm feeling worse.

350
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,420
Don't be like that.

351
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,890
Zura-chi said he'd drop by later.

352
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,460
We can all chat together.

353
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,950
Huh? Katsura-san?

354
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,080
Give me a break already.

355
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,370
Don't bring any more virus in here!

356
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,410
Don't worry.

357
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,580
Despite his looks,
Zura's tougher than I am.

358
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,470
He doesn't catch colds.

359
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,060
That may be true,

360
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,000
but just think, Gin-san.

361
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,480
Kondo-san is here.

362
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,160
Won't it be a problem if he and
Katsura-san see each other?

363
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,810
Man, it's working!

364
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,420
It's really working, Otae-san!

365
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,400
I'd say it's having more of a spiritual
effect than a physical one!

366
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,880
Since I almost lost my dignity
as a human being!

367
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,900
Oh my...

368
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,870
I'm surprised to hear that Kondo-san
had any dignity to begin with.

369
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,500
In any case, it would be bad for
Katsura-san to show up right now.

370
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,020
You have a point.

371
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,090
Excuse me!

372
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,780
Shoot!

373
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,660
We're too late!

374
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,500
Oh, you're here.

375
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,650
Over here! Over here!

376
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,550
Zura-chi!

377
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,870
I'm not Zura-chi.

378
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,030
I'm Ill Smith.

379
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,030
[Note: Wordplay of actor "Will Smith" and "Virus." Japanese
pronunciation of "Virus" sounds like "Wills."]

380
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,150
He's not just sick! He's
turned into Ill Smith!

381
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,070
He's obviously been infected!

382
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,360
Since he's Ill Smith!

383
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,890
Sick to his very genes!

384
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,780
And who the hell is Ill Smith?!

385
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,460
How pathetic of you all to catch colds.

386
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,930
Yes, we can.

387
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,930
[Note: Parody of President Obama's
campaign slogan.]

388
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,890
What country are you the president of?
"Yes, we can," he says.

389
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,970
His character's so random.

390
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,200
That's totally somebody else.

391
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,510
You were infected by this virus because
of the sloppy lifestyle you lead.

392
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,810
Yes, we can.

393
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,700
I don't want to hear that from someone
who's sick to his very genes!

394
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,390
An unbreakable will leads
to the prevention of colds.

395

[Note: Title of popular song by Namie Amuro.]

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,570
What are you saying?

398
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,040
Did the virus get his brain?

399
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,420
Well, I doubt the half-gorilla will
recognize him with that face.

400
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,080
Y-You're right.

401
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,460
Huh?

402
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,440
But that's odd.

403
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,060
Katsura-san's infected to his very genes,

404
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,160
yet he looks perfectly fine.

405
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,790
And there isn't any virus around him.

406
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,350
Hey! Look at that!

407
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,210
That's...!

408
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,160
The virus around Hasegawa-san
is vanishing!

409
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,060
Could it be...?!

410
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,670
Katsura-san is absorbing
Hasegawa-san's virus?!

411
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,760
I-I see...

412
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,260
Damn Zura...

413
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,850
I thought he never caught colds because
his body resisted viruses,

414
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,680
but it's the opposite.

415
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,680
His body absorbs viruses,

416
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,200
which means his immune system
was strengthened to the point

417
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,880
where he can never catch a cold!

418
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,520
That's why he became Ill Smith.

419
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,110
Which means...

420
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,770
M-My body...

421
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,560
I feel better.

422
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,080

423
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,020

424
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,210
A-Amazing...

425
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,690
He cured everybody's cold in no time.

426
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,690
I-It's like he's...

427
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,310
Yes, we can.

428
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,050
A messiah...

429
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:31,450
A messiah sent from the heavens
to save us from the virus.

430
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,610
Katsura-san, I mean, Ill Smith...

431
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,330
You were actually helpful!

432
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,510
Otae-san!

433
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,810

That's a relief.

444
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,460
Yes, we can.

445
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,260

448
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,790
What's with the forced flashback?!

449
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,660
Why did the flashback start with the
opening and finish with the ending?!

450
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,640
The eyecatch was even
part of the flashback!

451

Didn't you screw up the timing for starting
and ending the flashback?!

We can't do anything about that.
