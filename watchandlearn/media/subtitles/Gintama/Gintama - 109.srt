[Kotaro Katsura, 2X years old.
Why not have adults like this?]

10
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,750
Hey, did you hear? Takasugi
fought with the Shinsengumi.

11
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,830
He apparently sent a spy into the Shinsengumi
and tried to kill Chief Kondo.

12
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,430
Well, he ended up failing, though.

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,850
A spy, huh? We should be careful.
There may be a spy lurking about.

14
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,060
Umm, excuse me.

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,000
Wh-Who are you?!

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
H-Hold on a second. I'm not suspicious.

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,730
Who are you?! Give us your name!!

18
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,610
Umm... I see that you have a sword at your
side when there's a ban on swords...

19
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,500
I assume that you are Anti-Foreigner
Faction members.

20
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,730
What do you want?!

21
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,940
Please...

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,670
Would you...

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,090
Would you let me join the ranks
of the Anti-Foreigner Faction?

["Life is a Test"]

25
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,320
This is the most dangerous
part of my job as a spy.

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,450
It's called undercover investigations.

27
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,780
I sneak into the ranks of the enemy and
leak secret information to my allies.

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,540
The rewards are huge, but so is the risk.

29
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,370
Therefore, only the most skilled
spies take on these missions.

30
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,300
You must be skilled enough to
mask your true feelings while

31
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,960
risking your life when faced with the danger
of being discovered by the enemy.

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,580
And you can't make a single mistake
when in enemy territory.

33
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,760
You need finesse to perform your job
with precision in extreme situations.

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,630
And...

35
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,410
You need to be extremely bland in
order to blend in with everything.

36
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,550
The person in the Shinsengumi

37
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,660
who has all of these traits is none
other than I, Sagaru Yamazaki.

38
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,380
I never expected Anti-Foreigner Faction
members to be hiding in a town like this.

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,860

Called a holy land by otaku, it's Edo's
most famous mechanical district.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The town is like a maze. It's indeed
a perfect place for hiding out.

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,140
The Unstoppable Kotaro Katsura.

44
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,320
I have to get close to him. Find
out where his officials are...

45
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,490
And round up all of the Anti-Foreigner
Faction members.

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,240
I see. I understand.

47
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,980
All right. Let's begin the interview.

48
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,690
Huh?

49
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,290
Give me your resume.

50
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,490
Huh? Umm... I can't join the Anti-Foreigner
Faction without passing an interview?

51
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,100
It's a precaution against spies.

52
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,000
I can't fight and leave my back open to
someone with a suspicious background.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,510
What is this?

54
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,670
Why do I need to take an interview to partake
in Anti-Foreigner Faction activities?

55
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,080
S-Sorry... I forgot my resume.

56
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,240
But I am more concerned about
my country than anyone else.

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,810
I don't care about that.
Just give me your resume.

58
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,660
Let me give this to you straight.

59
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,620
Don't you have any common sense?

60
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,950
When you go job hunting, you usually
bring a resume with you.

61
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,880
Job hunting? I'm job hunting?!

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,900
You're supposed to come in a suit.

63
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,800
What did you come here for?

64
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,210
I'm not the only one who will tell you this.

65
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,390
Just to let you know, any company
will say the same thing.

66
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,740
You're not a company!

67
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,940
Also, you sat down before I told you to.

68
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,180
Usually, you sit after your
interviewer tells you to sit.

69
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,650
S-Sorry...

70
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,200
All businesses want people
who have common sense.

71

We say that a person's education
decides his worth...

72
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,010
But anyone can learn their
job while they're doing it.

73
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,880

can have fun with the maids.

I don't need you of all
people to tell me that!!

77
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,070
Why do I have to be lectured
by someone who

78
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,940
holds an interview in a maid cafe?!

Revolutionaries destroy
the existing norms.

85
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,550
And because of that, revolutionaries need
to understand what's common and normal.

he really just want to meet me?

There's no way the Anti-Foreigner
Faction

101

would ever do anything weird
like have interviews.

[Question 1 - Write down the correct reading
of the following word: Shinsengumi]

133
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,630
Question one. Write down the correct
reading of the following word.

134
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,940
What is this?! It's incredibly easy!! I see!

135
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,670
Even though we're Anti-Foreigner Faction
members, we need common sense.

136
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,770
Even if it's a test, it's a question to see
how much common sense one has!

137
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,350
I haven't studied for this test, but
it looks like I can pass this.

[Shinsengumi]

139
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,360
The answer is "Shinsengumi"!

140
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,270
All right, time's up. This is the answer.

[Scum]

142
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,040
The answer is "scum."

143
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,310
On what planet is that common sense?!

144
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,200
Well, this is common sense amongst
Anti-Foreigner Faction members.

145
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,920
Other answers like "idiots," "trash," and
"lately intrusive" are also correct.

146
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,710
All right! I got it correct!

147
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,480

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,410
You got the question wrong, too!

151
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,110
What did you study all night?!

152
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,850
This is bad. I can't even get the correct
answer using common sense.

153
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,130
I need to answer the questions with the mindset
of an Anti-Foreigner Faction member.

154
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,360
[Question 2 - Write down the correct reading
for the following word: Shogun]

The second question. Write down the
correct reading for the following word.

156
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:41,100
[Shogun Shogun Shogun Shogun Shogun Shogun]

157
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,700
The normal answer would be "shogun."

158
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,280
But to the Anti-Foreigner Faction,
he is the boss of the enemy.

159
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,100
Which means...

160
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,600
[Smegma]

161
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
I'll get it right if I insult him.

162
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,340
[Correct Answer: Ken Matsudaira]

163
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,040
The correct answer is Ken Matsudaira.

164
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,340
Why is there a kanji reading
for a kanji word?!

165
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,920
Well, this is common sense
amongst faction members.

166
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,380
"Roughneck," and "cooking
lover" are also correct.

167
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,380
[Note: "Roughneck" is "Abarenbo" in Japanese. Ken Matsudaira is the star of the TV show Abarenbo Shogun.]

168
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,730
All right! I did it!!

169
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,820
Why are there people who got it correct?!

170
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,080
What kind of brains do they have?!

171
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:11,100
[Question 3 - Write down the following
word in kanji: Jackie Chan]

172
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,220
The third question. Write down
the following word in kanji.

173
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,580
This doesn't have anything to do with
the Anti-Foreigner Faction anymore!

174
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,800
Jackie?! I don't know! This
is just plain unreasonable!

175
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,420
The answer is "nose."

176
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,100
[Nose]

177
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,550
You just hate Jackie's nose!!

178
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,660
Well, this is common sense
amongst faction members.

179
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,840
[Note: Jackie Chan played Ryo Saeba in
the Hong Kong version of City Hunter.]

180
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,840
"Chair" and "Ryo Saeba was pretty
painful" are also correct.

181
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,160
That last one was just your opinion!
Don't mention City Hunter!

182
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,840
We've been doing Japanese until now.

183
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,970
Starting with the next question,
we'll be doing math.

184
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,150
This is bad... I still haven't
got a single question right.

185
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,820
Question number four.

186
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,260
There are ten Shinsengumi members.

187
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,390
Six Anti-Foreigner Faction members run
into them on the side of the road.

188
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,050
The Shinsengumi attack, and three of the Anti-Foreigner
Faction members are killed.

189
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,350
Unyielding, the Anti-Foreigner Faction members
kill two Shinsengumi members.

190
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,090
Amidst the confusion of the battle,

191
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,530
two more Shinsengumi
members are injured,

192
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,310
but six more join them and two Anti-Foreigner
Faction members are killed.

193
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,140
How many noses does Jackie have?

194
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,710
One, of course!!

195
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,660
How long are you going to
keep talking about Jackie?!

196
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,740
This has absolutely nothing
to do with the battle!!

197
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,700
Umm... This question is incredibly
difficult, so I'll give you extra time.

198
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,650
Think about it for an hour.

199
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,860
I don't need an hour!

200
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,750
No...wait! He's been giving us
deceptive answers until now.

201
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,900
What if Jackie was in this battle?!

202
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,220
What if Jackie's nose...

203
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,590
Was cut off in the battle?!

204
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,730
The correct answer is "one."

205
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,020
You there, be quiet.

206
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,120
Oh, sorry...

207
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,470
I was completely tricked!

208
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,080
I read into it too much and let a
question I could answer slip by!

209
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,650
Tsk! A trick question, huh?

210
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,790
That was close.

211
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,650
What exactly were you tricked by?!

212
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,600
Umm... That's it for math.

213
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,270
This isn't math!

214
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,990
[Question 5 - Translate the following passage.]

215
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,440
The next section is foreign language.

216
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,990
Question five. Translate
the following passage.

217
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,180
What language is this?!
I can't read it at all!!

218
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,690
Is this an alien language
from another planet?!

219
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,920
An illustration?! That's it! That illustration!

220
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,020
That picture has got to represent
the contents of the passage!

221
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,110
I've got to rely on intuition and
this picture to translate it!

222
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,110
No matter how I look at this,
it's a picture of a battlefield.

223
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,100
One guy is about to die and the other
is listening to his last words.

224
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,180
There's no mistake...

225
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,420
He has something in his hand!

226
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,020
A letter? No, a photograph!

227
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Never mind me... Hurry up
and run away, you maggot!

228
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,040
The Sergeant quickly grew
cold in my arms...

229
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,860
He was a drill sergeant who
was so terrifying and hateful.

230
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,650
But right now his face looked so kind.

231
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,630
Can't you follow your superior's
orders, you maggot?!

232
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,340
Maggot! Tell me you're
a maggot, you maggot!

233
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,190
Sergeant! I am a maggot!

234
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,320
I was abandoned by my
parents like a maggot!

235
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,760
No one will be sad if a
maggot like me dies!

236
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,570
Please let me do whatever I want!

237
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,170
What a coincidence, maggot!

238
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,480
When I took up arms, I also
discarded my family.

239
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,340
No one will grieve for me anymore.
But you're different...

240
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,460
After the Sergeant said this he slowly
took a blood-splattered photograph

241
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,220
out of his inner breast pocket.

242
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,320
You have someone who
will grieve for you.

243
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,060
It was a picture of when my mother
was still young and healthy.

244
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,760
By her side was the Sergeant.
He was holding a baby.

245
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,210
Tell me I'm a maggot...my son.

246
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,510
Instructor...

247
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,750
You're a maggot.

248
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,540
You're a maggot's precious...good-for-nothing
father!

249
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,390
The instructor smiled
and ceased moving.

250
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,190
All right. This should be good!

251
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,490
Now, the correct answer...

252
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,050
Jackie's nose is big, isn't it?

253
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,020
That's it.

254
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,110
It was a picture of Jackie?!

255
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,670
How long a passage do you need to
express how big Jackie's nose is?!

256
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,180
It was wrong but I was touched.

257
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,650
Don't look at my answer!
It's too embarrassing!

258
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,250
The next question is the final
question in the written exam.

259
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,990
The last one already?! Most of the
questions were only about Jackie!

260
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,490
[Question 6 - Write down the reason why you want to join the Anti-Foreigner faction in Kamchatkan.]
[Note: Kamchatkan is a language spoken in northeast Russia.]

261
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,490
Write down the reason why you want to join
the Anti-Foreigner faction in Kamchatkan.

262
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,300
What?! Kamchatkan?!

263
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,860
This is impossible!! I can't write
in such a difficult language!

264
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,960
This is a difficult question so
if you get this right, you pass.

265
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,340
It's over. I failed my mission.

266
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,980
The Vice-Chief is going
to be angry with me.

267
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,510
I'll just write anything...

268
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,480
Umm... One person got it correct.
Examinee number 11!

269
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,490
Huh?

270
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,240
Wow!

271
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,160
I just wrote anything. Is this for real?!

272
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,740
Whatever the case, I can carry
out my mission! All right!

273
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,380
I did it!

274
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,100
Umm... Since he got it correct,
let's take a look at his answer.

275
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,120
When translated, it says, "I came here to
carry out an undercover investigation.

276
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,110
I will send all you Anti-Foreigner
Faction members to hell."

277
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,510
Huh?

278
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,530
What?!

279
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,450
Th-This is bad...

280
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,890
They discovered that I've come to
do an undercover investigation!

281
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,630
What's the meaning of this?!

282
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,220
Did they know who I was
from the beginning?!

283
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,880
U-Umm...

284
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,440
Hmm... You wish to become a part of
our undercover investigation squad.

285
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,720
Good job. Everyone, give
him a round of applause.

286
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,270
Huh?

287
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,100
They didn't find out who I was...

288
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,480
Thank goodness... Now I can...

289
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,030
Those who have passed the written
exam will now take the final test.

290
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,990
We will have a skills test.

291
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,610
Huh? Huh?

292
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,370
You will take a skills test for
undercover investigation.

293
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,930
Undercover investigation is
one of the most difficult

294
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,930
of Anti-Foreigner Faction activities.

295
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,030
The enemy isn't stupid enough
to overlook spies.

296
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,700
There is an idiot right in front of me!!

297
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,250
Even though it's a test, you
don't know what'll happen.

298
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,350
So you will take the test
under supervison.

299
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,360
Captain Dragon!

300
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,480
Captain...Dragon?

301
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,650
U-Umm...

302
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,220
Hello, I'm Captain Dragon.

303
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,890
Huh?

304
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,230
You're going to be sneaking into the headquarters
of a certain organization with me.

305
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,010
You'll pass if you can steal
a secret document.

306
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,230
Then you'll be a formal Anti-Foreigner
Faction member. Got that?

307
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,840
Well, anyway... You're one
of those, aren't you?

308
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,440
You're supposed to be him, aren't
you? You're a Jackie look-alike...

309
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm not Jackie. I'm Captain Dragon!

310
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,910
Your face is really close to mine.

311
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,340
Let me ask you one thing.

312
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,000
What is the one thing you must protect

313
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,690
more than anything during an
undercover investigation?

314
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,570
Huh? Is this a test question?

315
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,030
The answer is "your nose."

316
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,830
Your nose?

317
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,180
That's right. Your nose!

318
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,640
There are many vital spots
on the human body.

319
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,820
Amateurs often guess that the testicles
are the most vulnerable spot,

320
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,910
but this is wrong!

321
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,680
The most vulnerable spot is the nose!!

322
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,940
Got that?!

323
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,830
The final test...

324
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,020
Project Z will now begin!!

325
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,060
There it is. This was unexpectedly easy.

326
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,340
I did it! I've passed the skills test!

327
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,850
What wonderful skills!
You've passed so far!

328

But you're being tested until you get that secret
document safely to our headquarters!

Your excursion continues until you
greet the people back home!

330

Shh... Katsura-san, the enemy's
going to find us!

331
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,610
Hey, who was talking just now?!

332

We've got intruders!

They're in the secret documents room!

334
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,150
They discovered us!

335
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,420
The enemy found you during a crucial
time. You're still too naïve.

336
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
They discovered us because of you!

337
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,010
Let's run away! Follow
me, exam student!

338
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,800
Wait! They're over there!

339

345

Nunchucks? A hanger?
A dirty soccer ball?

A clock tower?

348
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,460
I see! I have to use one of these objects!

349
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,680
More than anything, I should choose
to escape. In that case...

350

This is it!!

351
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,870
This is the correct answer!!

352
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,530
Oh no! So that was the correct answer!

353

You fell?!

354
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,340
The answer is, "We'll use that cut for the
outtakes during the ending credits."

355

[Note: Parody of a Hong Kong

I can't use that!

357
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,910
Let's go! We're going to shake them
off with a car chase. I'm good at that.

358
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,040
There they are. Stop!

359
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,120
This is bad.

360
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,580
Why your nose?!

361
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,120
If you can protect your nose, you
should've protect your butt!

[Note: Parody of "Enter The Fat
Dragon" by Sammo Hung]

374
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,230
Wrong. The correct answer
is to call Fatgon.

375
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,750
Fatgon!

376
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,740
What is it, Dragon?

377
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,880
Why Fatgon?! Why is he here?!

378
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,080
If you called Un Pyao, you would
have gotten half a point.

get away from here!

What is the Shogunate doing?!

That's a poignant Anti-Foreigner

You should protect more
than just your nose!

400

All right, now!

401

Katsura is my enemy.

Captain Dragon is allied with
the Anti-Foreigner Faction.

407

In that case, there should be no
problem if I abandon them.

But this is an undercover mission.

409

be cold-hearted in order
to accomplish his goals.

414
