2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,580
I want to go back...

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,330
I...

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,510
want to go back to everyone.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,120
Shinpachi!

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,650
Your captain is finished.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,870
It's over.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,010
Old man.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,180
Your grandchild doesn't seem to realize that...

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,650
People have been protecting her, her whole life.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,190
Where's...

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,030
your wooden sword?

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,300
Uh-oh...

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,000
Where could it have gone?

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,820
Kyubei?!

16
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,240
Ahh...I finally found them.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,380
Shinpachi.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,770
You can see clearly now, right?

19
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,410
What you're fighting to protect?

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,770
What's important?

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,120
I can see just fine now!

22
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,650
[It's the final chapter of the Yagyu Arc! The long battle (with a one-episode break) finally comes to a conclusion!]

23
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,160
[Do you remember the rule that whoever breaks the opposing captain's plate wins?]

24
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,200
["A Woman's Best Make Up is Her Smile"]

25
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,260
Tsk, I let my guard down and he got me.

26
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,920
If this fight drags on, the difference in our skill levels will become obvious.

27
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,410
I have to finish this match right now!

28
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,110
Will I get Shinpachi-kun first?

29
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,540
Or will you get Grandfather first?

30
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,440
You think you can beat the lightning speed of my sword?!

31
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
No!

32
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,310
He's not after me!

33
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,770
He's after...

34
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,180
That leaves an opening to go after the captain...!

35
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,740
The most dangerous opponent is...

36
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,950
you!

37
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,290
What?!

38
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,330
Shinpachi!

39
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,430
Got it!

40
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,820
You read Kyubei's intentions in the blink of an eye,

41
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,950
and not only did you break his plate, but you grabbed both swords as well.

42
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,890
Outstanding.

43
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,930
But as I told you before-

44
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,950
you can't win this battle

45
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,140
carrying a burden like him on your shoulders.

46
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,650
It's not that simple!

47
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,730
Looking after that kid to the very end is what made you lose.

48
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,040
Why were you so determined to do that?!

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,990
End it, Shinpachi.

50
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,010
Sorry, I lost.

51
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,770
We!

52
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,980
Won!

53
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,360
Shinpachi!

54
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,330
Don't be so big-headed, dammit!

55
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,240
It was mostly thanks to Gin-chan that you won!

56
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,540
That's my brother-in-law for you!

57
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,760
You're the only one I can entrust the Shinsengumi to!

58
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,070
Who're you calling your bother-in-law?!

59
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,610
I don't give a damn about the Shinsengumi!

60
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,380
[Note: Okita now has to fight Hijikata AND Shinpachi for the vice-chief position.]

61
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,380
I've made another rival.

62
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,490
Impossible!

63
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,710
How could the Young Lord and Binbokusai-sama lose?

64
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,160
Damn you all!

65
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,470
What're you waiting for?!

66
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,560
That game meant nothing from the very beginning!

67
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,400
Forget about that and slay those scoundrels!

68
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,730
Don't let them sully our celebrity pedigree any further!

69
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,610
Koshinori, that's enough.

70
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,790
We lost.

71
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,650
Back down.

72
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,290
Kyubei made them a promise himself.

73
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,350
Return Otae-chan without a fight.

74
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,610
Papa!

75
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,640
I was against two women from the very start...

76
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,930
Don't say any more.

77
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,060
I know we told her to become a man, but...!

78
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,540
Don't say any more.

79
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,090
I'm sorry, Kyubei.

80
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,400
But this may have turned out for the best.

81
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,190
Man, woman... I'm not going to hold it against you.

82
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,480
But I think he knew...

83
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,830
why you tried to be his left eye.

84
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,570
And you knew, too.

85
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,630
Going to him while shouldering that burden wasn't going to solve anything.

86
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,190
You both knew that doing something like this wasn't going to make anyone happy.

87
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,840
I'm...sorry...

88
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,230
You don't have to apologize.

89
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,350
Nobody does.

90
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,190
Everyone was simply trying to protect what was important to them.

91
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,180
That's all this was.

92
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,030
Forgive me...

93
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,150
I...I will be your left eye, Kyu-chan.

94
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,010
I should have known.

95
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,970
Kyubei!

96
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,050
To survive in this Yagyu clan, you have to become strong!

97
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,050
I should have known.

98
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,830
Everyone was simply trying to protect what was important to them.

99
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,670
That's all this was.

100
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,350
What that man said is right.

101
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,170
I knew it all along.

102
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,010
My selfishness shackled you with a heavy burden.

103
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,950
I knew what you were feeling, but pretended to ignore it,

104
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,650
all because I wanted you near me.

105
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,690
Yet you still tried to protect me...

106
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,470
by saying you'd become my left eye...

107
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,810
I also knew that Father and Grandfather were trying to protect me by raising me as a boy.

108
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,230
But somewhere inside of me, I resented them for it.

109
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,400
They made me into someone who is neither man nor woman...

110
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,250
No one else is to blame for my becoming like this... It's my fault for being weak.

111
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,760
Yet everyone tried to protect me to the very end.

112
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,890
As it turned out, everyone was protecting me-nothing had changed.

113
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,730
I couldn't keep any of my promises.

114
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,730
I'm...weak.

115
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,950
Tae-chan...

116
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,950
Tae-chan...

117
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,260
Why did things turn out this way?

118
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,690
When did it start...?

119
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,070
I wanted to play house and cat's cradle with everyone else.

120
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,570
I wanted to wear a pretty kimono and walk around town like everyone else.

121
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,150
I wanted to become like you, Tae-chan... A strong girl with a kind heart.

122
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,550
Kyu-chan... You are Kyu-chan.

123
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,760
It doesn't matter if you're a boy or a girl.

124
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,550
You're my precious and dear friend.

125
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,700
So...don't cry...

126
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,320
And you call yourself a...samurai...

127
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,910
Tae-chan.

128
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,620
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

129
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,600
But today, it's okay to cry.

130
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,790
After all, you are a girl.

131
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,950
Welcome!

132
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,650
Who is this mummy?!

133
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,400
Don't come near me!

134
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,460
Go away evil spirit!

135
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,400
Hijikata-san, who would you like?

136
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,710
I see.

137
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,570
They all couldn't come...

138
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,570
I caused so much trouble, so I wanted to make it up to them.

139
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm sorry about what happened to you, too, Hijikata-san.

140
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,400
Because of me...you look like a mummy.

141
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,210
I didn't do it for you.

142
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,260
I went to fight, and came out a mummy, that's all.

143
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,620
I'm...as low as it gets, aren't I?

144
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,790
As it turns out, I did a selfish thing...and hurt everyone.

145
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,470
I caused trouble for Kyu-chan and everyone else.

146
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,330
I did those things with half-hearted feelings,

147
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,690
and wasn't even able to go through with it in the end.

148
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,160
What I did didn't help anyone.

149
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,240
You're not Buddha.

150
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,370
You think you can bring salvation to everyone you meet?

151
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,670
There are people you can save and others you can't save no matter how hard you try.

152
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,840
Is the way you live your life so fragile that you'd break just because of that?

153
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,150
Right now,

154
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,700
if there was someone you could save with that half-hearted sort of kindness you just talked about...

155
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,880
What would you do?

156
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,940
Thank you all for your patience.

157
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,210
The bride and groom will now make their entrance!

158
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,830
Gin-san.

159
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,750
How do people end up in situations like this?

160
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,570
This is just one step away from a shitty marriage meeting.

161
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,310
Boss, this isn't something to laugh about.

162
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,700
No, I'm not laughing.

163
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,240
I can't.

164
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,860
This is the first time I've felt like crying at another man's wedding.

165
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,180
Isn't there anything we can do?

166
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,480
This reception is simply a formality to introduce the couple.

167
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,500
Later, they'll go to the Princess's planet.

168
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,050
Once the formal wedding is done, Kondo-san will become one of the gorillas.

169
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,830
He's not coming back.

170
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,190
Tonight is our only chance to ruin the match.

171
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,180
Did you say ruin, Okita-kun?

172
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,760
This reception's been ruined from the start.

173
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,160
There's nothing but gorillas here.

174
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,890
Not even I can ruin something that's been ruined from the start.

175
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,910
Nothing but gorillas.

176
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,690
That's cruel, Boss.

177
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,720
After all is said and done, the Shinsengumi did play a role in rescuing Mistress.

178
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,750
Do this and we'll call it even.

179
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,690
This is Kondo.

180
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,980
Respond, over.

181
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,490
What're you guys waiting for?!

182
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,920
Hurry up and ruin this reception! Over.

183
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,750
This is what you're good at!

184
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,430
I didn't invite you guys just for the banquet! Over.

185
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,610
What banquet? There's nothing but bananas!

186
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,300
Don't treat us like fools! Over.

187
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,190
We Shinsengumi can't do anything violent this time.

188
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,130
Old man Matsudaira is behind this marriage.

189
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,680
If we go against him, the Shinsengumi will be finished!

190
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,980
That's why you outsiders are the only ones I can ask. Over.

191
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,250
Where are these from? Over.

192
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,220
Huh?

193
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,310
I'm asking where these bananas are from. Over.

194
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,660
Never mind the bananas! You like those bananas, don't you?! Over.

195
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,030
Bananas are the king of fruits. Over.

196
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,350
Don't "over" me!

197
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,410
You don't need to report such things! Over.

198
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,550
Hey, I have to pee. Where's the john?

199
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,160
Over.

200
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,360
Ask someone near you! Over.

201
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,500
Boss, I'll show you. Follow me. Over.

202
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,860
What's the point of doing that over the transceiver?!

203
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,140
You're just talking amongst yourselves! Over.

204
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,070
I'm doomed!

205
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,200
They have no intention of rescuing me! Over.

206
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,370
Will the bride and groom please step forward?

207
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,160
We have kept you all in suspense long enough.

208
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,260
We will now have...

209
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,120
the couple do their first ceremony together as husband and wife.

210
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,830
Whaaat?!

211
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,130
Just a min... Whaaa?!

212
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,170
Isn't it usually the cutting of the cake?!

213
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,040
Or the banana?!

214
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,530
No, no, no, no.

215
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,500
Something's wrong here.

216
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,110
It's definitely something that's done together, but not this!

217
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,080
Pops, what's going on?!

218
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,260
Kondo, this is a Planet Shojo wedding tradition to show respect

219
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,540
for the prosperity of their offspring.

220
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,090
Show them you're a man.

221
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,120
What's with that thumbs up?!

222
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,860
You want me to do it?!

223
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,940
Is that what you want?!

224
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,290
Somebody, break that thumb!

225
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,530
You've got to be kidding!

226
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,770
This isn't some perverted video shoot!

227
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,190
I'm not Kato!

228
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,630
I'm not a hawk, I'm a sparrow!

229
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,570
[Note: Refers to male porn actor Taka Kato. Taka means "hawk" in Japanese.]

230
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,570
That's what I am!

231
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,090
Even worse, everyone's watching!

232
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,880
Until a minute ago, they were enamored over their bananas,

233
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,550
but now they want to watch my banana?!

234
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,810
Shinpachi-kun, help me!

235
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm taking the rest home with me.

236
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,350
Forget the Tupperware!

237
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,950
You don't have to take bananas home!

238
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,580
How domestic can you get?!

239
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,950
Otae-san.

240
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,410
I wanted to see your smiling face one last time.

241
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,120
I got some on my left hand. Over.

242
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,520
I dribbled a little outside. Over.

243
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,450
Boss, how has Mistress been?

244
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,700
She's been a bit down.

245
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,130
Women are troublesome because they're so difficult to figure out.

246
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,140
If things end like this, Kondo-san's efforts will have been for nothing.

247
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,230
He worked so hard just to see her smile.

248
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,970
Don't worry about it.

249
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,990
The thing about women is they get depressed on their own and they get over it on their own.

250
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,250
That's not what I meant.

251
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,890
If Kondo-san ends up going to the planet of the apes, he'll have nothing at all.

252
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,800
Boss, isn't there anything we can do?

253
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,540
You don't have to worry about it with that woman.

254
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,690
She'll...

255
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,940
make it up to him.

256
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,860
Otae-saaan!

257
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,090
Sis!

258
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,060
Mistress!

259
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,050
Finally!

260
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,540
She's finally made up her mind to be the Chief's wife!

261
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,200
The gorillas!

262
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh shoot!

263
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,650
Let's go, guys!

264
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,150
The Shinsengumi can't lose to the likes of gorillas!

265
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,110
We'll decide who our Chief's bride is going to be!

266
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,610
Protect the Chief and Mistress's path to love!

267
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,590
Guys...

268
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,430
Kondo!

269
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,590
Why didn't you tell me you were in love with someone?!

270
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,200
This old man did something he shouldn't have!

271
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,600
Be happy!

272
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,030
Pops...

273
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,540
All you guys... Everyone...

274
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,550
I want to go back...

275
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,610
I...

276
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,650
want to go back to everyone.

277
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,020
Otae-san.

278
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,320
You bastards!

279
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,280
What the hell are you doing with my hu...

280
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,680
Hu-Husband?!

281
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,000
Her man?!

282
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
So what's the bottom line?

283
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,590
How does Mistress really feel about Kondo-san?

284
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,870
You guys don't understand women at all, do you?

285
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,620
She loves him.

286
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,790
Playing hard to get is a sign of love.

287
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,840
She loves him, all right.

288
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,450
What kind of sick show were you going to expose my brother to?!

289
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Sis!

290
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,470
Big Sis!

291
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,710
Mistress!

292
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,460
At least tell us your name.

293
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,600
It's merely a gesture of my goodwill.

294
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,200
But this is such a large gift...

295
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,710
I want to do it....

296
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,230
I caused quite a lot of trouble...

297
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,730
And besides...

298
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,840
I finally saw what I wanted to see.

299
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,700
This is where it was, after all.

[A Minute with 9th Grade Class Z Ginpachi Sensei]

301
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,930
A minute with...

302
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,600
Ginpachi Sensei!

303
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,440
Today, I have some news for everyone.

304
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,630
Onishi-kun, who studied with us for a year-and-a-half

305
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,850
here at GinTama High School, is transferring to the prestigious One Piece High School.

306
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,410
He insists that it was because of his father's job

307
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:03,570
and not because the academic standards are higher at the other school.

308
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,480
It's unfortunate, after we all got to know each other.

309
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,910
But remember you will all still be friends even if you're separated.

310
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,900
So, Onishi, stand out in hallway one last time.

I'm in deep poop!

314
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,340
Deep, deep poopy!

315
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,280
Real deep.

316
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,390
How deep? I'm talking deep.

317
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,850
