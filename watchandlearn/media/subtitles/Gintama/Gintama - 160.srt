Yeah, after four weeks, we're starting to get tired of this.

First place in the prelims for the pianist battle to decide Tsu Terakado's official fan club is

team Tsusengumi's Toshi!

53
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,230
After joining forces with the other teams to beat his rivals, he has now crossed the line!

54
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,160
A fine job of using wits to win the marathon prelim, believed to be a test of stamina!

55
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,310
Well done. Majumbo lottery.

56
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you very much. Huge mountain.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,080
Excuse me! Could you look this way?

58
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,020
And especially impressive was the power displayed in commanding the other teams!

59
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,540
The Tsusengumi is a fearsome force!

60
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,070
Is there a team capable of defeating them?!

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,920
They still haven't realized that these people were my pawns to begin with?

62
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,090
There are no other teams in sight!

63
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,440
The Tsusengumi has an overwhelming lead!

64
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,860
But isn't it kind of odd that there isn't anybody else coming?

65
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,450
Was there an accident back there somewhere?

66
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,750
You're having trouble holding them back?

67
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,630
It doesn't matter.

68
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,900
It isn't possible for them to break through that human wall.

69
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,080
We have a report!

70
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,050
They're giving up!

71
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,290
We have information that a large number of teams are giving up before reaching the goal!

72
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,480
A bridge has been knocked out at the seven kilometer mark!

73
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,590
A train has derailed at a crossing at the eight kilometer mark!

74
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,870
A large quantity of dog shit has appeared at the nine kilometer mark!

75
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,870
What is going on here?!

76
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,770
It's as if the heavens have decided to rain natural disaster after disaster to impede the otakus!

77
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,940
Only one team is past the nine kilometer mark!

78
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,160
Could that team have caused this?!

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,130
Is that humanly possible?!

80
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,820
D-Don't tell me they...

81
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,370
No... That's not...

82
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,660
Ah! Please take a look!

83
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,670
We have a team running through the empty streets!

84
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,350
It's...!

85
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,280
That coat is...!

86
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,050
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club's...!

87
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,550
Who the hell is that?!

88
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,810
Okay!

89
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,960
Yes!

90
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,260
Okay, we've made it to the finals. Yay.

91
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,030
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club has made an amazing comeback!

92
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,740
They've finished in second!

93
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,340
Hold it right there!

94
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,640
Who the hell is that?!

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,960
Where did you get him?!

96
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,120
Why is a total stranger crossing the finish line in slow motion?!

97
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,910
This guy wasn't on your team!

98
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,670
Yeah, enough of that already.

99
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,230
We already saw that reaction enough times last week.

100
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,790
What's with the attitude?!

101
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,260
How can you be so shameless when you used an illegal sub?!

102
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,590
Illegal sub?

103
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,530
Hey, don't make baseless claims when you have no evidence.

104
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,750
Evidence? That guy right there is the evidence!

105
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,130
Caught red-handed, damn it!

106
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,470
Hijikata-kun, a marathon is like life.

107
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,140
After making it through trials and tribulations,

108
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,600
you've matured so much that by the time

109
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,680
you cross the finish line you're practically a different person...

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,040
He's a different person!

111
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,400
He's obviously a different person!

112
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
You just don't get it.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,620
Ah, he's come at a perfect time.

114
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,520
There, have a look at your teammate.

115
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,710
Yamazaki-kun has also matured and completely changed.

116
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,800
His hairdo's changed!

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,100
Why would his hairdo change during a marathon?!

118
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,250
Why would a hairdo mature during a marathon?!

119
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,920
And wait, this would be the opposite of maturing!

120
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,620
Oh! And after the arrival of the Tsu Terakado Fan Club,

121
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,430
we have a member of the Tsusengumi who's practically a different person!

122
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,450
How am I supposed to carry out my job as inspector with this wild hairdo?

123
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,650
Yamazaki, don't tell me those guys...

124
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,870
I'm sorry. I goofed up.

125
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,860
But Hijikata-san, please just let it go.

126
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,160
Just overlook it.

127
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,390
They're holding a much bigger offense over our heads.

128
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,850
Ah, this is the place.

129
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,230
Don't worry. Don't worry.

130
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,340
I won't get caught.

131
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,180
Yeah, just send an invoice.

132
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,380
To Toshiro Hijikata.

133
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,770
Oh?

134
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,260
He looks awfully familiar.

135
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,400
Isn't that--

136
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,420
N-Now that I think about it, I recall seeing him...

137
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,380
That's right! There was a foreigner on your team!

138
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,460
Uh, what was his name again?

139
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,130
Taka-tin.

140
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,730
Yeah! Taka-tin!

141
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,250
Yeah, there was a Taka-tin!

142
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,450
Sorry about making false accusations.

143
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,450
Yamazaki's also grown so fine.

144
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,340
Okay, with that all settled, let's move on to the finals.

145
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,290
No looking around. Let's just move on!

146
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,290
As long as you understand...

147
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,670
You should have behaved to begin with.

148
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,000
Is this okay?

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,170
I can take you inside.

150
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,130
This is fine.

151
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,680
Then be careful.

152
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,020
Don't get lost again.

154
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,540
And the pianist battle to decide Tsu Terakado's official fan club...

155
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,710
It's only just begun and we've already got a wild one on our hands!

156
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,440
With all the injuries, desertions,

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,000
and dropouts, out of the thousand teams in the marathon prelims,

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,040
only two teams, the Tsu Terakado Fan Club and the Tsusengumi,

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,510
made it to the finish line!

160
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,150
On top of that, both teams had participants who got lost before being taken in

161
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,360
by the police and delivered here, a stretch of the rules...

162
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,110
How is that a stretch?!

163
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,790
Did you ever say that we couldn't get in a car?!

164
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,640
No, I didn't say anything about that,

165
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,790
but normally, I wouldn't need to tell people this, right?

166
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,490
How could we possibly know?!

167
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,840
Do you have any idea how stupid we are?!

168
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,280
Don't underestimate us!

169
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,980
That's right! Don't play us for fools!

170
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,770
Uh, Otsu-chan, what do you think?

171
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,170
Using a car in a marathon is most definitely...

172
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,560
The purpose of this contest is to show their love for me, right?

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,690
To go as far as to use a car in a marathon to come see me...

174
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,840
I believe that it can only be love!

175
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,220
Uh, we've just been treated to an amazing revelation.

176
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,650
You were allowed to use a car in the marathon prelims.

177
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,240
Hey! Are you serious?!

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,790
What was all our effort for?!

179
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,340
You should have told us in the beginning!

180
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,870
How are you going to make up for this?!

181
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,280
Well, I can understand the complaints,

182
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,470
but this is the pianist battle to decide Tsu Terakado's official fan club!

183
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,450
Otsu-chan's opinion is absolute.

184
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,840
So these two teams, the Tsu Terakado Fan Club and the Tsusengumi, will advance to the finals.

185
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,840
These two teams will battle for the honor of becoming Otsu-chan's official fan club.

186
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,380
This is bad. Very bad...

187
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,820
I didn't expect to end up in a direct confrontation with them.

188
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,660
Only my pawns would have remained once I eliminated their fan club.

189
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,560
I figured I could just wing it and picked up random members.

190
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,160
Who are you?

191
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,430
What do I do? What do I do?!

192
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,950
You look pale, Toshi.

193
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,580
You okay?

194
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,520
Don't worry.

195
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,600
The people here

196
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,250
are among the few who know that you've been possessed by that demonic sword.

197
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,340
True comrades gathered to free you from that fiendish blade!

198
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
We won't lose to that money-hungry bunch.

199
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,040
Right, Sogo?

200
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,730
Excuse me, how big is the reward?

201
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,540
Right, Yamazaki?

202
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,900
Excuse me, how expensive is a hair transplant?

203
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,610
They're such a shy bunch!

204
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,160
By the way, Toshi,

205
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,500
I've gotta go play golf with the old man at three.

206
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,540
What time does this end?

207
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,620
We will now hold three contests,

208
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,170
and the team which wins more contests shall win the right to be the official fan club!

209
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,440
The prelims were a test of stamina!

210
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,660
Next, we will test...

211
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,130
your brains!

212
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,800
You should know everything there is to know about your beloved Otsu-chan!

213
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,200
We will now have a quiz on matters related to Otsu-chan!

214
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,690
And you will be giving your answers from this slide!

215
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,010
When you get a question right, the opposing team's slide will tilt at a sharper angle!

216
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,660
Victory will go to which ever team makes the other team's members fall off!

217
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,660
However, if you get a question wrong, your own slide will tilt, so be careful!

218
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,720
Is everybody ready then?

219
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,070
The first contest of the finals!

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,280
Commence the quiz showdown!

221
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,610
Shinpachi!

222
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,880
What are you doing?!

223
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,220
The fan club has lost a critical member at the very beginning?!

224
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,810
What happened?!

225
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,400
Did his hand slip?

226
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,370
Shinpachi Shimura has an expression filled with regret!

227
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,150
Charge!

228
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,570
Why are you moving on like nothing's wrong?!

229
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,620
Why are you starting the finals without me?!

230
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,440
Oh? Shimura is also over here?!

231
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,880
Oh, my ass!

232
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,630
I just finished the marathon and made it here!

233
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,980
I had to struggle to make it here after being used as a decoy by my comrades!

234
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,780
Oh? You weren't here yet, Shinpachi-kun?

235
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,350
I didn't even notice.

236
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,610
We were moving along like nothing was wrong at all.

237
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,330
What?

238
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,780
Wait...

239
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,510
Seriously? Nobody noticed that I was missing?

240
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,860
Could you drop the serious looks?

241
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,400
I'll tear you all apart.

242
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,560
Well, in any case,

243
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,000
your tardiness means that you're disqualified from the quiz showdown.

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,460
Hold it right there!

245
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,180
You people were the ones who said it was okay

246
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,790
for the other members to take their time,

247
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,910
as long as one member on the team placed!

248
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,100
You people were the ones who forgot about me!

249
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,130
Shinpachi, don't worry!

250
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,490
We don't need you to beat these guys down!

251
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,390
That's not Shinpachi!

252
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,300
Those aren't even Shinpachi's glasses!

253
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,050
Score.

254
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,210
If he's out of the picture, we've won.

255
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,280
I apologize for reading your mind,

256
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,120
but could you at least use a better image to represent me?!

257
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,410
And why are they cracked?!

258
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,310
What's that supposed to mean?!

259
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,050
Then we'll pick up where we left off with the first question!

260
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,860
What?! I really don't get to participate?!

261
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,580
I don't get to join in?!

262
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,870
What is the name of the movie Otsu-chan saw when she was four and loves to death?

263
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,510
This is super easy!

264
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,860
Am I not allowed to say it?!

265
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,700
Am I not allowed to tell my team members?!

266
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,890
Hijikata from the Tsusengumi!

267
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,220
Roman Horrorday.

268
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,750
[Note: Parody of the movie Roman Holiday.]

269
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,750
He's right...

270
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,740
The last movie Otsu-chan went to see with her father...

271
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,520
Roman Horrorday!

272
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,790
Hijikata-san...

273
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,900
Even if it's to free himself from the demonic sword,

274
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,250
he's done his research about Otsu-chan.

275
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,050
This is bad...

276
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,900
Gin-san and the others don't stand a chance without me!

277
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,620
Sorry, but I came prepared.

278
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,390
This contest is mine!

279
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,150
Too bad! Incorrect!

280
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,880
What?!

281
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,590
So close.

282
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:30,490
The correct answer is Roman Horrorday, Gangster High School Rock and Roll!

283
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,820
Too bad!

284
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,380
Hijikata forgot to add an Otsu suffix at the end!

285
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,130
Hold on! Forgot to...?

286
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,610
That wasn't a rule...

287
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,160
So as a penalty, Hijikata's slide will tilt one notch higher!

288
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,340
No, wait, hold on!

289
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,880
How was that one notch...?!

290
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,020
Oh, Hijikata has already been eliminated!

291
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,590
U-Uh, excuse me.

292
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,140
Was that really just one notch?

293
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,530
That's like a 90 degree angle.

294
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,860
Otsu-chan has control over the slides.

295
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,670
The angle changes according to how Otsu-chan feels.

296
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,030
Otsu-chan is the law here!

297
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,710
How capricious are you?!

298
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,330
Did I do something bad to you?!

299
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,620
Was it so wrong of me not to use an Otsu suffix?!

300
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,420
Both teams have already lost their captains!

301
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,870
This match is completely up for grabs!

302
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,800
What do we do?

303
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,130
Nobody in there knows a thing about Otsu-chan!

304
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sure that the other side also recruited members at random.

305
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,410
We're both in the same situation.

306
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,970
In that case, the best strategy would be to not answer.

307
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,480
It'd be better to wait for the other team to screw up instead of fumbling for an answer.

308
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,390
["As Immovable as a Mountain."]

309
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,120
Then, here's the second question.

310
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,440
Don't answer!

311
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,150
Don't say anything!

312
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,490
Pressing the buzzer so early when you don't know anything?!

313
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,930
Who was that?!

314
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,100
Who the hell did that?!

315
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,320
Taka-tin from the Fan Club!

316
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,730
Please give us your answer!

317
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,430
Wh-Why did you press it?!

318
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,230
You have the least chance!

319
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,130
You definitely have no clue!

320
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,360
And what is that?!

321
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,730
Please wait a moment.

322
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,700
Why did you press the buzzer so early when you can barely speak?!

323
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,800
And who the hell is that?!

324
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,940
No, wait.

325
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,270
It's too odd for him to press the buzzer when so many factors are against him.

326
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,870
And the way he looks so confident...

327
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,100
Maybe we have a chance here...

328
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,040
Sorry. Can I go take a piss? Kadomatsu mark the way to hell.

329
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,040
[Note: Refers to rare proverb meaning "When you see Kadomatsu (gate pines) in new years, it means you're a year older.]

330
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,980
He just wants to take a piss?!

331
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,340
You hit the buzzer so you could say that?!

332
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,540
And how come your Otsu suffix sounded perfectly fluent when the rest was shaky?!

333
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,920
That was a phrase most Japanese people don't even know!

334
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,080
We've been done in!

335
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,220
Now we're one question in the hole...

336
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,630
Correct!

337
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,740
The question was, "What was the first thing Otsu-chan said

338
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,430
to the audience as a nervous wreck during her first concert?"

339
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,420
The answer is,

340
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,300
Can I go take a piss?

341
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,490
Taka-tin gave the correct answer without hearing the question!

342
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,440
H-He got it right!

343
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,870
Why?!

344
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,840
What kind of miracle was that?!

345
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,160
Amazing!

346
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,040
How did you know, Taka-tin?

347
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,070
Hey, Taka-tin! Hey!

348
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,950
N-No...

349
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,270
The entire Tsusengumi team will have their slides raised a notch.

350
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,100
Uh...

351
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,390
Otsu-chan?

352
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,590
Is it my imagination or is my slide the only one at an extremely steep angle?

353
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,590
What might this mean?

354
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,080
Then, we'll move onto the third question.

355
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,940
Hey! You're ignoring me?!

356
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,070
You're gonna ignore me?!

357
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,230
Please have a look at this clip!

358
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,690
What?! They haven't even played anything!

359
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,340
It's Taka-tin from the Fan Club again!

360
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,860
Why you?!

361
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,680
Didn't you want to go take a piss?!

362
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,330
And what kind of answer are you going to give without watching the clip?!

363
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,790
What was it again...?

364
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,260
What?

365
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,120
Could it be...

366
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,420
[Note: Kiyohara-kun is a baseball player.]

367
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,490
Do the bathrooms here have washlets? Hit the ball Kiyohara-kun.

368
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,340
This time it's number two?!

369
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,000
Shit!

370
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,320
Correct!

371
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,310
The question was, "What was the first item Otsu-chan bought at this store?"

372
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,480
The answer was a washlet!

373
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,240
Don't reveal private information about an idol that nobody wants to know!

374
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,300
Taka-tin has managed to answer consecutive questions correctly!

375
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,810
Taka-tin, way to go!

376
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,640
Hey, Taka-tin! Hey!

377
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,740
So, the Tsusengumi will be raised another notch!

378
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,850
And we'll move onto the fourth question!

379
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,500
No, seriously, why?!

380
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,530
Oh, it's Taka-tin again!

381
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,300
This time, he hit the buzzer without hearing a single word!

382
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,340
What?!

383
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,580
Fool.

384
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,910
A miracle can't happen three times in a row.

385
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,580
You'll be in the water for sure!

386
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,160
No, I can be certain this time.

387
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,990
That person isn't ordinary!

388
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:13,160
Yes, he must be the ultimate savior brought by Gin-san to help us!

389
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,870
He'll make this work somehow...

390
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,070
He'll give us another miracle!

391
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,700
Well, Taka-tin. Give us your answer!

392
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Go, Taka-tin!!

393
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,310
[Note: "Katochan, Pe." is a popular phrase used by the comedian "Cha Kato"]

394
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,310
Sorry, could I change my underwear? Katochan, Pe.

395
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,040
He's actually done it!

396
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,650
What?!

397
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,590
So he just wanted to take a shit?!

398
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,600
He's done it now!

399
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,780
He might have made it in time if he'd said something earlier!

400
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,350
And his Otsu suffix sounds a little strained!

401
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,150
Yeah, he's propping his ass up...

402
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,370
Just let him go already!

403
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,760
Just raise it all the way and finish him off!

404
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,110
He's done well!

405
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,480
You can change your underwear all you want!

406
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,370
Correct!

407
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,870
The question was, "What did Otsu-chan say when a friend caught her picking her nose?"

408
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,330
The answer is, Katochan, Pe!

409
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,340
The Otsu suffix was right?!

410
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,040
And what kind of questions are these for a quiz about a popular idol?!

411
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,650
Taka-tin has miraculously answered three questions correctly after buzzing in early!

412
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:21,150
And he's even revealed a technique where the Otsu suffix becomes a prefix!

413
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,270
No, you've got it wrong!

414
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,800
He's just a foreigner who's crapped his pants and wants to change his underwear!

415
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,240
Just let him go already!

416
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,940
If you don't hurry up, it'll be all over his ass, so let him go!

417
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,870
Taka-tin!

418
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,520
Hey, Taka-tin! Hey!

419
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,540
Forget the "hey"!

420
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,730
Enough with the "hey" already!

421
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,060
Just let him use the water to wash down!

422
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,730
But we're on the verge of winning...

423
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,420
Taka-tin soiled his pants to earn the blessing of the goddess of victory!

424
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,030
We'll do whatever we can to keep her on our side!

425
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,540
Uh, Otsu-chan...

426
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,150
Could it be that by some chance...

427
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,730
You hate me...?

428
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,810
Correct!

429
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,140
The answer was, "I physically can't stand him."

430
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,650
The Tsusengumi has rebounded from the verge of defeat to win!

431
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:30,010
The first contest, the quiz showdown, goes to the Tsusengumi!

The second contest is a glamour showdown!

00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,710
Glamour?!

How do you have a glamour showdown?!
