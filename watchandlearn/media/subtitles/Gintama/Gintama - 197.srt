["Not Losing to the Storm."]

3
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,880
You idiots!

4
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,690
What are you doing here?!

5
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,650
That's just cold.

6
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,810
I, Gintoki Sakata, am destined
to marry into the Ketsuno clan.

7
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,350
So if my family's in trouble, I'm obviously
going to come help, bro-bro.

8
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,880
Who are you calling bro-bro?

9
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,460
I don't recall choosing you
to be Christel's husband!

10
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,200
Leave!

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,640
Then if we win this world martial arts tournament,
you'll get me as your in-law. How's that?

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,060
Who'd want a prize like that?!

13
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,600
I'll give you off to Demon
King Piccolo or Krillin!

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Leave!

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,420
Don't be such a stiff.

16
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,310
She's already divorced once.

17
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,200
And this guy has kids,
so it's a perfect match.

18
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,860
You also plan on coming?!

19
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,500
Don't worry.

20
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,300
There won't be any complaints as
long as we get the inheritance.

21
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,860
We're willing to call anyone our Mom.

22
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,200
Your kids have a real nasty streak!

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,490
Gedomaru!

24
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,770
Take these people out of here!

25
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,980
Do you believe that people without magic
can possibly survive this fight?!

26
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,940
Lord Seimei, it's true that these
people cannot use magic.

27
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,320
They cannot use divination
or call shikigami.

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,690
They don't have the power
to stop this rain.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,820
But they know how to bring
back Lady Christel's smile.

30
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,050
I can promise you that.

31
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,850
I believed that there was no one
left in the Ketsuno clan to fight...

32
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,980
Very well.

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,540
You may join Seimei...

34
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,900
No, join Christel in the depths of hell.

35
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,510
The final battle of the weather war!

36
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,230
The Shikigami Tag Team Mystic
Death Match begins!

37
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,660
Wait, Doman.

38
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,760
These men are not...

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,520
Didn't you hear me say to wait?!

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,780
Bro-bro, you don't need to worry.

41
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,950
I'm sure that they'll be able to win.

42
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,020
They aren't so weak as to lose to magic.

43
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,780
This isn't about losing to magic!

44
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,420
That isn't even a shikigami, is it?!

45
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,760
It's a shikigami.

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,480
The Odd Jobs gofer.

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,940
It's a gofer wearing full body tights!

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,420
His eyes are swimming all over!

49
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,570
It's doing the butterfly!

50
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,900
It's splashing everywhere!

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,130
Yasunori, take the first match.

52
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,910
Show them the might of the Shirino clan.

53
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,400
Yes, my lord!

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,290
I summon you, Yashamaru!

55
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,800
Then I shall explain the rules now.

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,250
Hey, he stopped doing the butterfly!

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,130
He's sunk to the bottom of the pool!

58
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,050
Three Onmyoji from each side will
team up with their shikigami

59
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,730
to determine a victor through
a battle of magic.

60
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,830
Call the lifeguard!

61
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,970
He's drowning!

62
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,730
Save him, quick!

63
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,240
There will be any legal implications
if someone were to die.

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,290
No way in hell!

65
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,650
I can't do this, Gin-san!

66
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,360
Hey!

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,950
Don't ignore me, damn it!

68
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,750
And if you give up before you die, you
will survive, but naturally, you'll lose.

69
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,320
I give u-

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,220
Did you say something, Team Ketsuno?

71
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,690
Nothing at all.

72
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,720
I forgot to feed him.

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,430
Here's some Petigree jam.

74
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,760
Eat up.

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,090
Then I will now explain the
rules for the first match.

76
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,170
The first match will consist of a three-legged race
by shikigami and master that culminates in...

77
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,920
Is this an eating race?

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,620
We have a chance of winning then!

79
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,980
The Pandemonium-eating race.

80
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,970
Wh-What the hell is a Pandemonium?!

81
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,830
One of the shikigami's favorite foods.

82
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,490
Pandemonium larvae.

83
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,270
Well, it's sort of like a snack.

84
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,620
You're so lucky to get an eating contest.

85
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,610
How could something so
creepy be a snack?!

86
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,360
A three-legged race to the Pandemonium, or Pan
for short, and the first to finish eating it wins.

87
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,290
First, my ass! That monster
is not edible, damn it!

88
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,760
On your mark!

89
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,380
Hell no!

90
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,080
Not in this life!

91
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
I refuse to go!

92
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,200
No more!

93
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,760
Ready!

94
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,280
Wait!

95
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,030
Go!

96
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,600
What's this?!

97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,160
Team Shirino cannot run due
to the shikigami's size!

98
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,990
Ow! My crotch is being torn apart!

99
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,020
What are you doing?!

100
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,220
Hurry it up!

101
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,900
They just might win?!

102
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,500
See? I told you.

103
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,770
Stand, Shinpachi!

104
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,650
Eat the Pandemonium!

105
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,470
Not happening!

106
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,620
Anything but the Pandemonium!

107
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,710
Hell, it's looking at me!

108
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,590
It's staring at me!

109
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,190
This isn't much different from a crab!

110
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,130
Crabs, squid, shellfish, and goosefish!

111
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,130
Gin-chan said that the uglier
it looks, the better it tastes!

112
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,610
That's not the problem here!

113
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,730
Doesn't matter how good it tastes,
I just can't eat this monster!

114
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,240
Close your eyes and I'll
shove it in your mouth.

115
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,350
You're not allowed to use your hands.

116
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,250
As we speak, Team Shirino
has managed to catch up!

117
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,600
Shinpachi! Hurry!

118
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,750
Eat before they do!

119
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,500
Damn it, screw it!

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,840
I'll just pretend I'm doing
it for Ururun Taizaiki!

121
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:32,360
[Note: Documentary show where celebrities
homestay in foreign countries.]

122
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Damn it! Just a little farther!

123
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,290
Hey, what are you doing?

124
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,730
No, uh...

125
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,420
My first kiss...

126
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,660
No, nothing...

127
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,280
Huh?

128
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,120
Let me recover.

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,170
Me too...

130
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,560
It was also my first...

131
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,500
Well, what an unexpected turn of events!

132
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,110
We have an accidental kiss with the Pan!

133
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,150
Who gives a damn?! Just hurry up!

134
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,650
What's with the wolf-whistling?!

135
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,110
Eat it!

136
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,320
Hurry up and eat it!

137
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,790
M-My bad! I didn't mean to do that.

138
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,350
I'm sorry to, well,

139
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,750
take your important first time like this...

140
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,160
I don't really mind...

141
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,530
Why are you blushing?!

142
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,720
I don't get it!

143
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,750
What's with the fluffy atmosphere?!

144
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,920
How do you go from a
Pandemonium-eating race to this?!

145
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,910
Why am I so concerned about
an accidental kiss...

146
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,740
It doesn't matter if I kissed
this Pandemonium...

147
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,490
Hey! If you have time to start monologuing,
eat the damn thing!

148
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,610
That was just an accident,
not even a real kiss...

149
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,670
It's not like Pandemonium-san
wanted to kiss me...

150
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,030
Who the hell is Pandemonium-san?!

151
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,350
A classmate?!

152
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,830
And it doesn't even matter right now...

153
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,820
Huh?

154
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,970
Who the hell is this?!

155
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,180
Was this how Pandemonium-san looked?!

156
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,410
[Note: From the manga "Berserk"]

157
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,770
Didn't it have a face like a Behelit?!

158
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,410
Huh? That's weird...

159
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,260
Huh?

160
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,660
Why is my heart beating so fast...?

161
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,010
Was Pandemonium-san always so cute?

162
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,570
This is bad!

163
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,790
It's getting harder to eat this...

164

Hey, Shinpachi.

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,410
What are you doing?
Hurry up and eat it.

166
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,860
Um, right...

167
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm sorry!

168
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,680
Did I touch you somewhere weird?

169
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,050
No...

170
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,200
My chest...

171
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,930
Chest?!

172
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,070
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!

173
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,200
It's okay.

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
I know...

175
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,700
My heart started racing so much that I...

176
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,690
Next time, I'll try to keep myself
from making any noise.

177
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,600
Stop!

178
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,610
My heart's gonna burst!

179
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,400
Is he an idiot?

180
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,890
A complete idiot?!

181
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,070
It's getting more and more
difficult to eat you...

182
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,580
I'm falling harder and harder for you...

183
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,180
Hey! Cut this out!

184
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,660
This is a Pan-eating race!

185
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,850
Why are you falling in love with the Pan?!

186
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,150
You don't need to hold back.

187
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,450
Please eat me.

188
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
Stop!

189
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,300
Stop talking!

190
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,310
It was my first time,

191
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,290
but it was also my last kiss.

192
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,240
I have no more regrets.

193
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,090
Thank you for making me
feel like a girl at the end...

194
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,040
I can't do it!

195
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,990
How could I eat this lovely girl?!

196
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,660
What the hell is this idiot rambling about?

197
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,730
Eat me quickly.

198
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,570
If I'm going to be eaten,
I would rather it be by you.

199
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,400
Shinpachi, eat it.

200
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,170
Meanwhile, Team Shirino
has finished the Pan!

201
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,930
Is Team Ketsuno about to lose?!

202
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,290
You must hurry!

203
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,040
That's right!

204
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,330
Drop me to the floor so
it's easier to eat me!

205
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,310
Please hurry!

206
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,010
That's not it...

207
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,560
Your kindness is preventing me from...

208
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,460
Shinpachi, outta the way!

209
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,050
Let me take care of this!

210
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,020
Pandemonium-san!

211
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,870
What the hell are you doing?!

212
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,630
Hey! Give Pandemonium-san back!

213
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,480
It appears that we have
won the first match!

214
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,690
Not yet!

215
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,950
Whoa! Team Ketsuno has
launched an attack!

216
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,400
A flurry of blows to the stomach

217
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,120
This is...?

218
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,400
Could it be...?!

219
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,660
Spit it out!

220
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,370
Hmm? Where is it?

221
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,140
I'm having a hard time finding it.

222
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,610
Oh, here it is.

223
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,700
This thing ate two of them so
I can't tell which is which,

224
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,640
but which one do you want, Shinpachi?

225
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,140
How can I eat that?!

226
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,850
The Shirino clan is disqualified
for throwing up.

227
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,540
The Ketsuno clan refused to
eat and is also disqualified.

228
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,430
The first match ends in a draw!

229
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,060
Bah, a draw?

230
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,960
Oh well.

231
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,620
It's mostly Shinpachi's fault.

232
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,170
I did what I could.

233
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,240
It's mostly your fault.

234
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,450
That was one hell of a grotesque fight.

235
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,290
I feel sick now, damn it!

236
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,380
No, you've done well.

237
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,880
To be honest, I was amazed by your ability
to knock out that fiend without any magic.

238
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,390
So you finally trust us, bro-bro?

239
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,140
Please don't be sad, Mr. Shinpachi.

240
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,100
I will live on in your heart.

241
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,630
Pandemonium-san?

242
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,670
Pandemonium-san...

243
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,860
I will never forget your soft lips...

244
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,310
And I will never forget...

245
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,540
about your soft-headedness.

246
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,180
I appreciate the help.

247
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,250
But I want you to leave
if it gets dangerous.

248
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,770
Christel won't be able to
smile if you all perish.

249
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,320
Right back at you, bro-bro.

250
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,700
Who are you calling your bro-bro?

251
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,210
Call me Seimei.

252
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,000
I won't be able to name you her husband
without Christel's permission,

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
but I have the authority to
consider you a friend.

254
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,050
Nah, no thanks.

255
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,160
Do you want me to curse you to death?

256
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,180
Then we will begin the second match!

257
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,790
And since the first match
ended in a draw,

258
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,490
the second match will settle the battle.

259
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,830
A contest involving a 4 on 4 Tag Team
Mystic Shoot Death Match.

260
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,540
The fight will continue until
one side is destroyed!

261
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,130
Go, Gin-chan! Sister lover!

262
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,090
Send these clouds!

263
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,960
Send this rain!

264
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,990
Flying away!

265
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,070
The contest will follow a ten count rule.

266
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,580
Each side can only have one
tag team inside the ring.

267
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,160
Otherwise, use a slap to trade places.

268
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Seimei, this world doesn't need two men
with the title of greatest Onmyoji.

269
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,880
Let's end it now.

270
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,200
The long struggle between
Shirino and Ketsuno...

271
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,840
A spiral of fate that's been
lined with hate...

272
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,930
Now let the match begin!

273
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,730
Wait, I was still talking.

274
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,620
Did I take too long?

275
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,540
Should I have gone with something
more compact?

276
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,010
Lord Doman!

277
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,820
Exterminate the hated Ketsuno clan to usher
in a golden age for the Shirino clan!

278
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,520
Go, Gin-chan! Sister lover!

279
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,780
Bring back Ms. Ketsuno's true smile!

280
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,400
I'll let someone else warm you up.

281
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,560
Soan, show them a thing or two.

282
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,290
Oh! Team Ketsuno has launched
the first attack!

283
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,160
Too soon!

284
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,450
Haven't summoned my shikigami...

285
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,040
I'll beat the crap out of you

286
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,240
before you can use your funny magic!

287
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,160
You wimps can't beat me
in a physical brawl!

288
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,970
Lord Doman!

289
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,710
Touch! Touch! Touch me here!

290
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,710
[Famous line from the opening song
of the Touch anime series.]

291
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,540
Oops, stepped in some poop.

292
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,190
Wow!

293
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,380
Gedomaru isn't letting Doman escape!

294
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,820
Hey you.

295
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,810
I hear you're Ms. Ketsuno's ex-husband.

296
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,850
If you're her ex-husband,

297
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,690
that means you've done this and that

298
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,290
and all kinds of

299
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,470
weather phenomena with
her! Is that it? Huh?!

300
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,130
All kinds of thunderstorm warnings?!

301
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
All kinds of flood warnings?!

302
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,140
Master Gintoki, now is your chance!

303
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,250
Right on! Time to finish this!

304
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,750
The Ketsuno Style Ultimate Attack!

305
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,630
Ketsuno(Ass) Bomber!

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,880
An explosive deadly attack!

307
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
Doman has already lost...

308
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,810
He dis-

309
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,250
-appeared?!

310
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,410
Oh. Sorry, Master Gintoki.

311
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,130
What's going on?

312
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,740
Where's Doman-san?

313
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,460
Fools.

314
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,730
Did you fall under my spell?

315
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,280
Can't you tell?

316
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,780
You were fighting a mere illusion.

317
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,450
I haven't moved a single
step from this spot.

318
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,820
An illusion?!

319
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,910
You can't even touch me,
much less hurt me.

320
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,910
Uh, Lord Doman...

321
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,510
There's something dripping
from your ass.

322
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,640
It's not what you think.

323
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,460
This is just chronic hemorrhoids, I swear.

324
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,290
No, I'm serious!

325
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,540
What's with those looks?!

326
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,460
Okay, fine! I'll show you then!

327
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,110
I'll show you my perfect
hemorrhoids as proof!

328
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,360
Doman used an illusion,

329
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,780
but he appears to have suffered
severe damage to his anus.

330
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,080
What was the point in using an illusion?!

331
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,020
Finish them off while I put
some medicine on my ass.

332
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,240
The enemy is on its last legs.

333
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,190
Finish off the small fry
and draw Seimei out.

334
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,440
I summon you, Bontenmaru!

335
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,380
Master Gintoki, get a grip.

336
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,620
You're going to be killed if
you don't do something.

337
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,960
Anything I can do?

338
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,680
M-My balls...

339
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,090
A hernia...

340
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,580
Push them back...

341
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,500
Back down please...

342
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,210
to their original throne...

343
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,910
This is no time for you making jokes.

344
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,860
Will hitting your back work?

345
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,380
Y-Yes...

346
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,520
Please do...

347
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,320
Hurry...!

348
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,650
Come back, xxxxicles!

349
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,070
How far were you trying to
push it back down to?!

350
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,830
Well, I had to deliver
an equivalent shock.

351
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,920
You were going to drop my life
before you dropped my balls...

352
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,750
Trying to beat me to death?

353
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,630
Huh?

354
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,970
Hold on a second.

355
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,910
Isn't this...

356
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,600
You didn't just drop my balls!

357
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,120
They're rolling around on the floor!

358
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,610
How is it even possible for
your balls to fall out?!

359
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,280
What are you going to do about this?!

360
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,890
Fix this!

361
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,280
Put them back!

362
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,070
I'm busy.

363
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,290
Lord Seimei, please assist.

364
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,060
Bah, I suppose I have no choice.

365
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,920
Oh! Amazing!

366
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,400
Seimei has instantly restored the balls to
their throne without entering the ring!

367
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,680
I won't let that happen!

368
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,540
Don't interfere, Doman!

369
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,060
I won't let you have your way, Seimei!

370
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,770
An unexpected battle has
erupted outside the ring!

371
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,600
Seimei and Doman

372
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,110
are engaged in an intense battle over xxxxicles
that can't be followed by the naked eye!

373
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,560
The hell are you people
doing with my balls?!

374
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,310
Curse you! Go up!

375
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,270
Down you go!

376
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,950
I fake up and go down!

377
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,810
I fake down and go down!

378
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,410
I go straight down!

379
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,430
Ow, ow, ow!

380
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,390
Hey, freaks!

381
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,780
You're both just smashing
them against the floor!

382
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,750
There's no end to this.

383
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,700
Doman, I have a proposal.

384
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,460
What is it, Seimei?

385
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,260
There are two balls.

386
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,040
I will take the right,

387
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,070
while you take the left.

388
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,790
Each in control of one.

389
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,090
Why?!

390
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,450
Why are you dividing up my balls?!

391
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,440
Amusing.

392
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,440
A battle where we each control
one ball and make them fight.

393
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,720
Why are you making them fight?!

394
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,450
What kind of fight is this?!

395

Oh! We have a second intense
battle outside the ring!

403
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:54,940
Ow!

404
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,300
Cut that out, damn it!

405
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,950
They are channeling the xxxxicles!

406
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,210
A proxy battle through xxxxicles!

407
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,450
Ball crashing against ball!

408
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,480
Will the right one reach the throne?!
Or will the left one prevail?!

409
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,990
Send them both back!

410
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,040
Ouch! Ouch!

411
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,760
They're being crushed!

412

Please stop!

413
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,980

may do different things,

but they both want to help
people in the end!

418
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,750
Somebody stop this fight!

419
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,200
Will that do it?

420
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,900
Crushed!

421

Starting the count!

425
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,190
Who needs a count?!

426
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,600
I'll crush his head and toss
him out of the ring!

427
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,330
Gedomaru!

428

Team Ketsuno has successfully
pulled off a switch with Seimei!

429
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,220
Hey! Get a grip!

430
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,060
Master Gintoki.

431
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,350
Kin-chan!

432
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,480
However, Sakata is not coming to!

433
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,170
He may never stand again.

434
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,660
If you get my drift.

435
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,070
Forgive me for letting this go this far...

436

If I wasn't a failure...

437
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,920
There's still hope if we hurry!

438
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,480
I summon you, Kuzunoha!

439
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,910
You called, Lord Seimei?

440
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,500
Kuzunoha, join Gedomaru
in healing this man.

441
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,620
You take Sasuke while Gedomaru
takes Bossun.

442
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,620
[Note: Bossun=Yusuke's nickname.]

443
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,310
Very well.

444
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,240
And who the hell is Bossun?!

445
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,810
Lord Seimei.

446
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,450
Do not fear.

447
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,670
Leave the rest to me.

448
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,650
Have you lost your mind, Seimei?

449
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,510
Your shikigami have been dispatched
all over Edo, limiting your powers,

450
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,070
and now you use your last
one on another person?

451
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,560
An Onmyoji without shikigami is
like a samurai without his sword!

452
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,680
You believe you can defeat
Bontenmaru bare-handed?!

453
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,100
Seimei-san!

454
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,010
I can no longer see...

455
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,510
Doman,

456
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,430
it appears that I've lost
sight of myself again.

457
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,490
But this time,

458
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,110
I care not about duty, honor,
tradition, the Bakufu...

459
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,920
Nor of our long struggle
with the Shirino clan...

460
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
I see nothing at all...

461
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,390
Impossible!

462
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,760
He withstood an attack from
a shikigami unarmed?!

463
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,040
What's this...?!

464
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,100

465
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,650
You couldn't have...!

466
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,680
Seimei, you bastard...

467
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,380
You've unsummoned the countless
shikigami watching over Edo

468
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,950
to focus all of your power!

469
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,170
Your actions will cause you to be
dismissed as lead guardian of Edo!

470
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,960
I no longer have a need to watch over all!

471
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,500
I only want one thing...

472
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,390
I only want to see her smile...

473

That's all.

474
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,160
Come get me, Doman!

475
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,840
I shall show you the true power of the head
of the Ketsuno clan, Seimei Ketsuno!
