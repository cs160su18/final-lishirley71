[Starting this New Year's on, thank you for all the "cheering" cards.]

3
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,080
[Viewer comments are very important. By the way, why is the background all black?]

["What Happens Twice, Happens Thrice"]

5
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,320
Huh? What's this...? The sky is all black...

6
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,830
Huh? I'm the one all black...

7
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,870
Huh? Has something like this happened before? Huh?

8
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,590
Wake up.

9
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,270
Your hidden power... The time to awaken it has finally come.

10
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:15,360
Open...your eyes...to the gateway of your true potential...

11
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,600
Wake up...

12
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,230
Huh? Where are we?

13
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,300
Good morning. What's this? Where are we?

14
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,460
"What's this"? I don't know. When I woke up this morning, I was in this place.

15
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,300
Is there a power outage?

16
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,440
Even if it's a power outage, I can see you all very clearly.

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,250
It's a strange dusty place. I'm covered with dust.

18
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,720
Whatever! I have a hangover, you know.

19
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna go back to sleep. Shinpachi, heat the bathwater.

20
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,570
No, wait, Gin-san. There's no bath.

21
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,390
Shinpachi, cook some food.

22
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,350
Today is your turn to cook, Kagura-chan!

23
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,810
Whatever! I wonder if this is all a dream...

24
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,460
I'll go back sleep, too.

25
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:14,420
Wake up... Your hidden power... The time to awaken it has finally come.

26
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,060
Shut up. Who set the weird alarm?

27
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,280
This is the time to wake up.

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,950
It's still eight in the morning! Let me sleep two more hours at least, idiot.

29
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,270
No, well...it's not an alarm...

30
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,130
Kagura-chan, you're grinding your teeth too loud!

31
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,800
Excuse me, but please listen to me. Um... Well, wake up!

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,560
Excuse me, please wake up! Excuse me, please listen! Everyone!

33
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,970
I said wake up already!

34
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,050
Cut it out!

35
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,950
How could you fall back to sleep in another world?!

36
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,180
You must've read it in the atmosphere!

37
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,410
Didn't you notice that it's not quite normal, you idiots?!

38
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,060
Gin-san! Gin-san, please wake up.

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,660
What the...? Geez, shut up.

40
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,050
There's a strange man...

41
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,840
You finally woke up.

42
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,770
Welcome to my world. Finally, the time for you to awaken has arrived.

43
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,800
Huh? Who are you?

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,570
Don't you know, Gintoki?

45
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm with you all the time.

46
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,810
I'm your blade, which you've used to overcome many hardships.

47
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,180
[Toya]

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,740
My name is...Lake Toya!

49
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,740
[Note: Spoof of Zangetsu from BLEACH.]

50
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,450
The spirit of Lake Toya?

51
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,560
Well, you can call me that, too.

52
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,000
Gintoki, as I am the closest to you, I know...that you're strong...

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,230
No one in history has been able to use me like you do. But...but...

54
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,580
It's still not enough! You can still become stronger!

55
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,790
You haven't tapped my full power yet!

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,250
Do you want to become stronger, Gintoki?

57
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,670
No, I'm not interested.

58
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,550
...Huh? Eh? What did you just say?

59
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,400
Well... You're so annoying. I'm sorry. My head really hurts, so sorry...

60
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,380
Huh? No, but... What?

61
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:21,500
The show is past its second year, so isn't it about time to develop an ultimate technique?

62
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,220
If I do say so myself, it's really useful. Let me teach it to you.

63
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,480
Excuse me, but today is our regular day off, so can we go home?

64
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,270
No...well...it's far more useful than you think.

65
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,160
If you learn it, you'll be able to use it repeatedly. And it'll help the anime artists, too.

66
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,910
And, most of all, you'll easily be able to make a big scene...

67
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,930
Shut up, you bastard! Just return us to our world right now!

68
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,700
...I see... Well, it's fine with me if you don't want to...

69
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,230
Really... It's not like I was asked to do it, anyway...

70
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:59,010
Well... I just called you on my own... I'm sorry for making a mess...

71
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,350
But let me just tell you...

72
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,600
...If you ask me to teach you the ultimate technique later, it'll be too late.

73
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,240
This is a one-time only offer. I definitely won't teach it to you later.

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,610
Ah, it's like a New Year's bargain. It's a shame to miss out.

75
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,390
Zenkai or Fuusenmaru is really useful...

76
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,390
[Note: Zenkai and Fuusenmaru are from BLEACH.]

77
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,750
You know...

78
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,790
Just say, "please teach it to us"!

79
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,000
You don't need an ultimate technique? Don't you have any ambition?!

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,830
Why are you sleeping for the third time in front of a spirit?!

81
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,470
Even on your day off, you hardly ever fall back to sleep three times!

82
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,460
Hey! Wake up, you guys!

83
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,240
That's enough! If you don't wake up within three seconds, I'll kick you in the thigh!

84
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,100
Seriously! I'll really do it! You won't be able to walk!

85
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,050
Here we go! One... Hey, hey, the countdown to hell has just started.

86
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,470
Ah, it's so scary! And two! Ah, there's only one second left!

87
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,330
I'm counting! Really! And three!

88
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,720
Come on! I'm making an announcement! An announcement!

89
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,350
Let me give you five more seconds!

90
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,620
It's a special rule that gives you another five seconds...

91
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,900
Shut up!

92
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,310
What's with you?! Tell us straight...exactly what are you trying to do?

93
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,230
I'll tell it to you straight.

94
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,780
You're not too bad if you can hurt a spirit's legs... But you're still too green.

95
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,160
You'll be able to get stronger.

96
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,030
I'll tell it to you straight...we became strong enough to make a spirit's eyes tear up, so that's enough for us.

97
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,160
Please let us return home.

98
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,200
If you learn the ultimate technique, you'll be able to not only affect the eyes,

99
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,950
but also the nose and mouth.

100
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:40,320
It'll be possible to bring forth bodily fluids from every orifice.

101
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,140
Sounds like it's your ultimate technique.

102
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,040
Why are you adamantly refusing to learn the ultimate technique?

103
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,760
What? Are you just shy? Or are you ashamed to shout out the ultimate technique's name?

104
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,280
Everyone needs to have patience when learning it.

105
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,210
The important thing is getting used to using it.

106
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,990
I wonder why this guy is so adamant about teaching us the ultimate technique.

107
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,940
Perhaps an enemy stronger than anything you have ever faced will appear.

108
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,770
You can't survive without this ultimate technique.

109
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,710
And I'll be in trouble if something happens to my master.

110
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,940
In addition, if this anime is released as a fighting game,

111
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,230
it'll be too plain if it doesn't have an ultimate technique.

112
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,580
Think about the business aspect.

113
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,790
Don't you know how hard a time Bandai's had?

114
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,390
[Note: Namco-Bandai is the parent company of Sunrise, which is the studio that animates GinTama.]

115
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,390
You worry about things beyond your control!

116
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:35,350
If you still refuse to learn the ultimate technique, I have an idea.

117
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:41,150
I won't return you to your world until you learn it.

118
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,500
Forever... You'll be stuck in this world.

119
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,300
Ah, that's fine. Some food...

120
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,940
We'll stay here for a while.

121
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,510
Well...it's not like "a while," but forever...

122
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,080
Ah, hey, don't open the refrigerator without asking permission.

123
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,290
What? We won't be able to leave here ever, right?

124
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,320
Then it's all right to open the refrigerator... Whoa! This miso is moldy.

125
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,560
Whoa! No, wait... Ah, I bought that to eat after my bath...

126
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,340
Anyway, there's no way we can live in a dirty room like this.

127
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,850
It's filled with dust. I guess I'll have to clean up.

128
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,920
There're a lot of weird books under the bed.

129
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,020
Ah! Hey! Don't touch anything in my room without asking permission!

130
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,630
Stop! Please stop it!

131
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,970
Hey, there's a lot of curly hairs on the floor.

132
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,220
I wonder what this is...

133
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,380
No! That's wrong! Those are from my pet. They're not mine...

134
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,670
I can smell some strange odors coming from the trash.

135
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,590
There're so many rolled up tissues in there.

136
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,200
No! That's not right! That is, you know... I ate grilled squid yesterday! That's it!

137
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,380
Please just be quiet! Don't move around.

138
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,000
Where did you buy those sunglasses?

139
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,770
Go home! Go home, you guys!

140
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,450
What? I thought we would never, ever leave this place, right?

141
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,300
No, please go home!

142
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,210
Never mind about the ultimate technique or anything else.

143
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,150
Just go home, please!

144
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,730
I was kindly offering to teach you the ultimate technique!

145
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,290
But if you are just going to make a big mess, please go home, already!

146
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,410
I don't care anymore! I really don't care whether you die!

147
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,870
Please go...

148
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,720
...home...

149
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,280
Why are you saying such selfish things?!

150
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,010
Lake Toya Spirit!

151
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,890
You invited all your friends here, so how can you say "everyone go home"?

152
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,760
You can't make any friends because you do things like this!

153
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,550
M-Mom...

154
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,800
Somehow...the mother appeared... the mother of the spirit...

155
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,300
That's not your business, Mom. Stop being so nosy.

156
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,040
The reason why I can't make any friends is because Daddy's had so many job transfers.

157
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,300
Don't blame everything on his transfers!

158
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,090
Daddy has his own circumstances with his job!

159
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,810
Why does his mom have a beard?

160
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,780
I'm really sorry, everyone.

161
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,450
He changes schools a lot, so he doesn't know how to make friends.

162
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,920
Please don't hate him. He's basically a good boy.

163
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,810
That's all right. Don't worry about it.

164
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,800
Um...I'm sorry to ask you something like this,

165
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,770
but could you learn the ultimate technique from him?

166
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,180
Hey! Lake Toya, come over here!

167
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,580
Please teach us the ultimate technique!

168
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,780
Hey! Everyone wants to learn the ultimate technique!

169
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,380
What are you doing, Lake Toya?! Hurry up and get over here.

170
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,630
No, it's all right...really...

171
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,170
What do you mean, "It's all right"?!

172
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,390
You were the one who called everyone over so you could teach them the ultimate technique, right?!

173
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,920
Come on, what are you doing?

174
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,410
I just said "it's all right"!

175
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,900
This is... This just isn't the right time for me to teach anyone the ultimate technique!

176
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,430
I look really pathetic!

177
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,910
What are you talking about?!

178
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,100
To-kun, you look so cool! Mom thinks you're really cool, too!

179
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,420
And these guys don't look like they really want to learn any ultimate technique! So no way!

180
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,890
What are you saying, To-kun?!

181
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,990
I know you worked really hard to think up the ultimate technique!

182
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,790
Mom knows all about that! You worked really hard!

183
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,580
I already said, "no way"! You're so annoying!

184
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,760
What do you mean "annoying"?! Come on!

185
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,990
Do your ultimate technique for Mom! Let's show them what it looks like!

186
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,960
No, no! They're watching us! It's too embarrassing. You're so annoying!

187
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,100
What do you mean "annoying"?!

188
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,600
I mean...

189
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,170
You're really annoying... Jumbolic Magnum!

190
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,210
Ah...he did the ultimate technique on his mother.

191
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,410
Oh! Mom!

192
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,220
Yes...that's it...

193
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,380
To-kun...

194
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,880
Mom!

195
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,760
Mom!

196
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,420
Mom!

197
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,520
Hey, I'm home.

198
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,790
I just got home.

199
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,780
D-Dad...

200
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,610
Y-You... Your mom...

201
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,470
[Note: Refers to the actor, Jack Nicholson.]

202
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,470
That! There! What did you do to your mother?! Jack Nicolle Cannon!

203
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,410
To-To-kun...

204
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,410
This is the time...for you to be free of the curse of your father having to transfer so many times...

205
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,000
Defeat...your father...

206
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,390
Jumbolic...

207
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,120
...Jack Nicolle...

208
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,070
No way! You'll break up the family.

209
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,240
Ouch!

210
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,820
Ow...

211
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,810
Ow... It seems you have completely mastered that.

212
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,000
That's your ultimate technique... the "Thigh Kick."

213
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,870
Who needs it?!

214
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,770
Huh? What's this? The sky is all white...

215
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,350
Huh? I'm the one all white...

216
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Huh? I think something like this also happened last New Year's day... Huh?

217
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,740
Wake up.

218
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,370
Gently open...your eyes and...

219
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,160
...the door to the closed-off world...

220
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,470
Wake up...

221
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,100
What's this?

222
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,890
Hey, Toshi, what's going on?

223
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,610
I don't know. When I awoke this morning, I was in this place.

224
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,470
It must be a dream.

225
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm sorry, but I'm going back to sleep.

226
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,240
Sogo, cook some food.

227
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,410
Did you hear that, Hijikata?

228
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,580
But why me?!

229
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,470
It's ridiculous. I'll go back to sleep, too.

230
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,840
Wake up... I said, wake up...

231
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,690
Mom, you're so absent-minded. It's still the New Year's holiday.

232
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,110
There's no school today.

233
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,450
Come on. I'm not going to wake up just because someone orders me to.

234
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,800
Wake up. It's time for you to wake up. Open your eyes.

235
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,240
Well, excuse me. Could you please wake up?

236
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,700
U-Um...

237
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,160
I can't remember when I last slept this long.

238
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,530
You seem to have finally awakened.

239
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,110
You're...

240
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,230
Yes, I'm...

241
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,490
[Note: She looks like Orihime from BLEACH.]

242
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,490
Aren't you cold? It's the dead of winter.

243
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,180
Huh? Well...I'm...

244
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,050
Yeah, yeah. You can tell us at the police station.

245
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,700
Huh?

246
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,420
You are under arrest for indecent exposure. You're too flashy.

247
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,640
No, wait.

248
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,620
Can you stop talking like I'm a pervert?!

249
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,420
I'm not. I'm different from those degenerate...

250
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,620
I'm a real...

251
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,080
A real degenerate?

252
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,930
Wh-!

253
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,790
If that's the case, we have a real sadist.

254
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,970
We have a guy who's a real dog-food maniac, too.

255
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,490
Who are you talking about?

256
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,570
Don't make fun of mayonnaise, you bastard!

257
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,810
Please listen to my story.

258
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,130
I'm neither a degenerate nor a human being.

259
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,050
I'm a goddess...

260
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
...your Goddess of Victory.

261
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,180
S-Sogo...

262
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,210
Well...

263
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,220
She says that she's not human, but a goddess.

264
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,560
If that's the case, we should get serious.

265
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,170
No need to worry.

266
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,200
People like her will recant after a bit of punishment.

267
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,970
I said I'm a true goddess!

268
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,410
Moreover, there's the weird white background.

269
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,140
Can't you understand the situation?!

270
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,470
That reminds me... I didn't see any background for a while.

271
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,130
I thought it was because the anime staff was slacking off.

272
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,720
If you understand, then please remove these handcuffs!

273
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,820
No, I still don't know.

274
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,060
What's the connection between a white background and a degenerate?

275
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,600
Anyway, you're under arrest.

276
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,260
Just give up, and tell us the way back to our police station!

277
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,780
What are you talking about?

278
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,230
I've never heard of a goddess being arrested!

279
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,620
Well, we have.

280
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,470
Not just a goddess, but also death gods, lords and even streakers.

281
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,870
We've caught them all before.

282
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,980
Toshi, Sogo, stop it.

283
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,840
Kondo-san...?!

284
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,560
Why are you crying?

285
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,750
That is a real goddess.

286
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,740
So, you finally realize that I'm a goddess.

287
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,050
Yes, you've had it really tough during your life.

288
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,760
Wait! That's my diary!

289
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,820
I read it very carefully. You really had a hard time.

290
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,100
No, give it back to me!

291
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,010
Please give it back! Oh, no!

292
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,350
For all these reasons, she went through many hardships.

293
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,610
There's room for leniency!

294
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,840
You mean, I'm still a criminal?!

295
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,310
Of course.

296
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,220
Be quiet.

297
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,590
No kidding. I'm really mad now.

298
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,210
You guys live here the rest of your lives!

299
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,170
I don't care anymore!

300
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,250
I'll devote the rest of my life to you!

301
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,960
So, even if you want to break up, I will refuse!

302
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,560
What's this?

303
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,330
Is this a new type of masochism?

304
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,040
No, it looks like she's had really bad luck with men.

305
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,300
She's the type who loves a miserable situation.

306
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,930
That's why she was taken advantage of.

307
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,950
Everyone, the meal is ready!

308
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,360
It looks like we've been put in a strange situation.

309
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,210
This is a real farce with that indecent woman.

310
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,750
No, she's a goddess. It looks like she's a real goddess.

311
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,550
What should we do, Kondo-san? She's acting like a new wife.

312
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,760
Are you going to play the role of the husband, Chief?

313
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,330
Don't say such a stupid thing!

314
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,150
I have Otae-san, the only woman in my heart.

315
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,660
There's no way something like that could happen!

316
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,920
You say that, but you look like you're ready to join in the farce.

317
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,630
Then Hijikata-san, you'll be the treacherous mother-in-law.

318
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,620
Hey, but I'm a man.

319
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,570
And I'll be the corrupted fool who behaves improperly.

320
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,480
So-kun, what are you doing?

321
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,150
Shut up.

322
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,360
I need the money!

323
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,240
But if you take it without asking, the goddess will be upset!

324
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,180
[Note: A party ticket is a ticket for a certain event sold amongst college students.]

325
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,550
I'm left with party tickets to sell!

326
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,180
I'll be in trouble if I don't sell them!

327
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,740
Are you saying I should threaten to rob my friends?

328
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,120
I didn't say anything like that...

329
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,310
Then leave me alone!

330
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,000
No! Anything but that money!

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,620
Shut up!

332
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,280
What kind of play is this?

333
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,040
Stop!

334
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,000
Huh...?

335
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,960
Don't raise your hand to the goddess! I won't forgive you!

336
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,520
Stop! You misunderstand! So-chan didn't do anything bad!

337
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,710
Since when did I become "So-chan"?

338
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,080
I've always admired you, Goddess... Your innocent smile...

339
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,610
...and that slightly melancholic beauty mark.

340
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,220
I've always been watching you from the shadows.

341
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,700
That's stalking!

342
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,330
You're one to talk...

343
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:15,920
Huh?

344
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,170
What the heck is going on here?

345
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,270
Let me explain.

346
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,240
He's the Angel of Death.

347
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,790
Two years ago, his affairs were uncovered, and they broke up.

348
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,840
But they're growing to like each other again.

349
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,210
No, I'm the Angel of Death.

350
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,670
Ma-Manager?!

351
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,820
Another strange man has shown up.

352
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,840
By the way, I'm the God of Poverty!

353
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,950
But it's strange. I didn't have any affairs.

354
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,190
Ah, then it's probably that!

355
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,690
Two years ago, right after you lived in sin, he started committing domestic violence.

356
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,930
No, that was me.

357
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,150
[Note: Parody of Ichigo from BLEACH.]

358
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,150
The Soul Reaper! Why have you come here?!

359
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,230
Not just me...

360
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,170
[Note: Refers to the God of Netherworld, God of Destruction, Sake no kami (God of Wine).]

361
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,560
Meifushin, Kijin, hakaijin, and Sake no kami ...

362
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,170
I heard you've been dating all of them for the last two years.

363
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,060
What?! There's no way a goddess would do something like that.

364
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,950
I didn't hear anything like that!

365
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,870
W-Well...

366
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,860
There's not a single decent god...

367
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,740
Anyway, how can she handle herself around all these people and still keep it a secret?

368
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,480
Because she's a goddess?
Or, rather, she's a terrible bitch.

369
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,460
I told you... She's had many hardships, hasn't she?

370
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,690
I've lost everything...

371
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,010
I know it's all my fault.

372
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,520
But I was lonely...

373
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,850
Because I'm a goddess, I can be a little greedy.

374
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,680
Sadist Mode Change.

375
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,910
[Note: Spoof of Kamen Rider Den-O.]

376
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,150
If you lost it, then just get it back.

377
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,260
That's true! Yes!

378
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,840
I'm the Goddess of Victory!
I'll just take back what I lost!

379
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,260
With my own power! I'll win over my happiness with my own power!

380
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,630
What?!

381
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,460
Go for it! Oh!

382
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:23,380
Like this... In order to ensure my true love and happiness,

383
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,670
I worked my best to fight...

384
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,650
...and I kept fighting and fighting...

385
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,930
...and got lots of men.

386
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,340
And I realized that working hard is so beautiful...

387
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,820
...period. Huh? Was this a composition?

388
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,530
P.S. I'll be as happy as I can...

389
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,940
The next episode... "The More Delicious the Food, the Nastier It Is When It Goes Bad."

390
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,320
[Food safety is a big issue these days. And this social anime will take a closer look at it.]

391
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,060
[Forget it... GinTama is not that kind of show. But does GinTama have a safety problem?!]
