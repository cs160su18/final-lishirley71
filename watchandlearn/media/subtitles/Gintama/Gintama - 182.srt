00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,240
Deep down, they're being all proud
of themselves, you know?

162
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,490
Kagura-chan and Sadaharu
both went up...

163
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,890
I'm the only one who didn't
change... Still at 8th.

164
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,030
What's so bad about not changing?

165
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,070
My rank went down.

166
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,060
Oh, sorry. That wasn't my intention...

167
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,280
Maybe the mohawk was a problem...

168
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,330
I'm very sorry...

169
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,370
No, it doesn't matter.

170
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,150
Less stress this way.

171
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,680
My previous ranking was
odd to begin with.

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,970
Must have been an organized vote,
or some under-the-table business...

173
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,890
Th-That's not true.

174
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,010
It's impressive, considering how
little screen time you get.

175
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,150
I have the second-most screen
time in the show...

176
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,810
Uh... Did we do something wrong?

177
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,630
No... It's not an issue of right or wrong...

178
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,470
The problem would be that
we haven't done anything...

179
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,830
You've gotta catch their attention...

180
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,160
Whether in a good way or a bad way,

181
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,650
if you can't hook the audience, you're
going to pass under their radar.

182
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,160
A hook...

183
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,570
It's true that we haven't done that.

184
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,270
Ah, sorry about grouping us together.

185
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,300
Nah, it's fine.

186
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,620
You don't need to be considerate today.

187
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,760
But it's too late to try to hook them...

188
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,470
Quite frankly, I think it's over...
This is as far as I can go...

189
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,620
No matter what I do, my image's
been established.

190
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,340
And Bandai-Namco is clearly
looking down on me...

191
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,630
Maybe it's just wrong for me wanting
to be more popular...

192
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,440
Wishing for character merchandise
based off of me...

193
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,400
Maybe they've realized
how desperate I am...

194
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,280
Maybe it's turned people off...

195
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,230
Shinpachi-kun...

196
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,610
Is it so shameful to place 8th and 9th?

197
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,810
Huh?

198
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,040
Wouldn't 8th and 9th place be as good
as first for boring characters like us?

199
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,120
Yamazaki-san...

200
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,380
Even if we're to place 1st or 2nd,

201
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,800
would that be okay?

202
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,440
No, right?

203
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,650
There are plenty of colorful
people, flowers, around us.

204
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,690
And those flowers need dirt,
a steppingstone, to bloom.

205
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,150
We don't need to become number
one in a popularity poll.

206
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,110
We can be number one at
being their steppingstones.

207
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,810
Do the best you can in the role you've
been given, the position you hold...

208
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,350
Yamazaki-san...

209
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,420
Yamazaki-san...

210
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,060
You're such an adult.

211
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,850
But I'm...

212
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,300
I'm no adult.

213
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,990
I was the same as you a while back.

214
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,760
I thought that if I worked hard...
If I worked hard...

215
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,020
I could place 1st...

216
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,810
Yamazaki-san...

217
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,860
Huh? That's odd...

218
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,950
I gave up on that a long time ago...

219
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,350
Why is this happening now?

220
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,080
Sorry!

221
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,350
Ya-Yamazaki-san!

222
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,140
H-Hang in there, Yamazaki-san!

223
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,350
What...

224
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,380
What happened?!

225
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,930
Yamazaki-san's ranking
is sinking like a rock!

226
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,820
His underwear being removed
to reveal a shameful sight

227
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,830
has led to a dramatic change
in his popularity!

228
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:58,270
Th-There's still... someone who hasn't accepted...
the results of the popularity poll...

229
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,450
Quickly... Run away...

230
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:13,450
Th-That person intends... to forcibly
alter the results... of the poll...

231
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,980
[Popularity Poll Arc]

232
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:32,530
Th-There's still... someone who hasn't accepted...
the results of the popularity poll...

233
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,360
Quickly... Run away...

234
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,480
Th-That person intends... to forcibly
alter the results... of the poll...

235
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,300
Wh-What's that?!

236
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Hurry...

237
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,020
Protect your 8th position...

238
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,890
Th-The number one position
for a boring character...

239
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,150
Y-You must... protect it at all... cost...

240
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,410
Ya-Yamazaki-san...?

241
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,960
Yamazaki-san in 136th place!

242
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,220
I-Impossible!

243
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,910
How can you alter the results
of the popularity poll now?!

244
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,850
The results were announced before
the opening sequence!

245
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,010
What could possibly be
accomplished now?!

246
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,170
In any case, I have to let everyone know!

247
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,300
They're all targets!

248
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,250
But who did this?!

249
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,800
I don't know who it could be...

250
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,060
The perpetrator removed Yamazaki-san's
underwear to climb the rankings...

251
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,970
It must be someone ranked
below Yamazaki-san!

252
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,230
Damn it!

253
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,540
There are too many candidates!

254
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,730
Who can I trust?!

255
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,470
Th-That's...

256
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,010
25th!

257
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,940
Sa-chan-san!

258
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,910
Why is she here?

259
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,340
Could she have...?!

260
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,950
So you're the one who's trying to ruin the
popularity of the higher ranked characters

261
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,170
and stir up the rankings.

262
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,320
The perpetrator?! She's talking
to the perpetrator?!

263
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,470
Who is it?

264
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,260
Despicable.

265
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,500
Will you be satisfied with a high
ranking through this method?

266
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,790
Who is it?!

267
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,760
Sarutobi-san, could you not
make odd accusations?

268
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,880
If that's your reason for calling
me out here, may I leave?

269
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,660
I'm quite busy, you know.

270
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,560
S-Sis!!

271
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,320
Don't play dumb.

272
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,120
Look above your head.

273
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,280
Your ranking's gone up.

274
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,440
So has yours, for that matter.

275
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,640
It must be nice to sit at
such a round number.

276
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,980
Oh, but it doesn't matter if
everybody's rank went up.

277
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,120
Sorry, the gap between you and
Justaway will never go away.

278
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
But don't beat yourself up about it.

279
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,390
You haven't had much screen time lately.

280
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,890
It's not your fault if you
lose to a lifeless object.

281
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,410
Oh, but Justaway hasn't had
any screen time either,

282
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,600
so I wonder why it's a higher
rank than Sarutobi-san...?

283
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,860
I-If I had more screen time, Gin-san and I
would have finished in 1st and 2nd place.

284
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,590
But look at you, Otae-san...

285
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,400
You had so much more screen
time than I did and yet...

286
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,380
Huh?

287
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,130
I see gorillas...

288
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,920
Twin gorillas?

289
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,510
What are those? Pets?

290
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,440
Huh?

291
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,190
But you're ranked below them!

292
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,180
Why are the three of you
lined up together?

293
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,550
Gonna start a band?

294
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,930
Gorilla triplets?

295
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,780
N-Not good...

296
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,350
This is starting to look very bad...

297
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,430
Hey, I don't care about the rest.

298
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,940
But don't group me with those animals.

299
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,970
Animals? Otae-san...

300
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,460
You shouldn't say that
about the manga artist.

301
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,200
Wait, you also called them
twin gorillas, remember?!

302
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,310
Otae-san, you'll be the one
that's ignored this year!

303
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,150
What?!

304
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,140
I'll make it so you never
show up again, whore!

305
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,840
Bring it on!

306
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,430
Once you're gone, I'll get a little
more screen time, gorilla bitch!

307
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,470
Sis! Stop!

308
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,090
That's enough, you two...

309
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,250
Ky-Kyubei-san!

310
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,630
Kyu-chan...

311
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,860
Now isn't the time to be fighting here.

312
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,060
Both of you must be aware by now...

313
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:44,730
There's an insolent villain ruining the popularity of
the higher ranked characters for personal gain.

314
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,040
Yes, yes! That's right!

315
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,230
This isn't the time to be fighting!

316
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,440
We must prepare preventive measures.

317
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,630
That's right! That's right!!

318
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,260
They should be fine.

319
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,300
None of them seem to
be the perpetrator.

320
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,630
Okay, I'll join in...

321
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,110
We must take advantage of the
chaos to attack the keep!

322
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,890
Eliminate every high-ranked
character and conquer all!

323
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,790
Wh-What is she talking about?!

324
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,920
Wait, Kyu-chan! Are you serious?

325
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,130
I know that I'm being unreasonable, but...

326
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,990
I can't stand the fact that
Otae-chan isn't 1st.

327
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,090
The rest doesn't matter.

328
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,690
She isn't the perpetrator,
but she might as well be!

329
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,410
In war, he who strikes first, wins.

330
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,480
Fortunately, the highest-ranked
characters didn't gain anything.

331
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,130
They haven't noticed this mess.

332
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,390
Now is our chance to
catch them off guard.

333
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,760
So you say, but you're the highest
ranked character here.

334
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,670
Won't you end up 1st in the end?

335
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,090
Once I have completed my conquest...

336
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,740
I will...!

337
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,250
Take my own life.

338
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,940
Why are you risking your
life for a popularity poll?!

339
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,660
You don't have to do that, Kyu-chan!

340
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,290
Besides, I can't possibly do such
terrible things for personal gain.

341
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,970
Ranking in the top 10
is more than enough.

342
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,790
She intends to take out most of
the higher-ranked characters!

343
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,270
That's right! Gin-san's included, so
we can set the cutoff at 8th place.

344
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,920
That barely includes me!

345
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,120
Couldn't you barely leave me out?!

346
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,690
But maybe we shouldn't...

347
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,960
Yes! That's good!

348
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,030
Peace is good.

349
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,090
After all, that would include Kagura-chan
and Sadaharu-kun...

350
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,450
Hey, what about me?!

351
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,220
Oh?

352
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,100
Who is this girl?

353
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,430
Tsukuyo? What is this?

354
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,840
Who is this? What's with this girl?!

355
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,180
Why is she ranked 9th ahead of us?!

356
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,370
Wait, Otae-san.

357
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,040
This girl had twice the votes you did!

358
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,140
O-Oh...?

359
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,140
Ah, she's fairly cute, I guess.

360
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,740
Fairly cute? This girl...

361
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,260
is loaded with hooks!

362
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,660
A scar on her face plus the pipe!

363
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,510
How greedy is she?!

364
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,540
What's wrong with this girl?!

365
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,730
According to Tojo's investigation,

366
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,700
she speaks with a classic
prostitute accent.

367
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,910
What?!

368
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,540
What's with this girl?!

369
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,320
Otae-san, what's with this girl?!

370
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,890
O-Oh...? She's determined
to make an impression...

371
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,690
What?! What?!

372
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,780
There's no need to speak
in such a manner.

373
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,800
This is starting to get scary...

374
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,190
And also according to
Tojo's investigation,

375
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,360
Gintoki groped her breast.

376
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,960
Groped?!

377
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,990
What the hell?!

378
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,760
I ain't never been groped, biotch!

379
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,560
Say, this is starting to get ugly...

380
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,310
Oh...?

381
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,930
Ah, that's why Gin-san's
been down on his luck.

382
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,970
This girl must be a bad luck woman.

383
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,770
You're right.

384
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,290
Her face screams bad luck, biotch!

385
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,090
Right? Nothing good can come from
getting involved with this type.

386
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,540
Poor thing.

387
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,000
What, this is the bad luck
woman I've heard about?

388
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,250
Coming from three of the
worst bad luck women!

389
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,220
Stop it!!

390
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,440
I don't want to see any
more of this ugly act!!

391
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,460
And according to Tojo's investigation,

392
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,680
she was featured from episodes
177 through 181.

393
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,200
Oh...?

394
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,300
Then starting from episode 182...

395
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,640
She shouldn't need any
more screen time!

396
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,010
Sis! Sa-chan-san!

397
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,510
Stop! Somebody stop them!!

398
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,880
I see...

399
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,170
Then we should attack her first?

400
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,150
Otae-chan, where are you going?

401
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,110
I'll let the two of you handle her.

402
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,430
I'm going to deal with the source.

403
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,430
Source?

404
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,730
To make sure there aren't any more new female
characters taking away my screen time...

405
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,490
I'll go crush the gorilla in 15th.

406
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,800
Not the gorilla!

407
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,440
This manga, I mean, anime will end!

408
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,060
This is bad!

409
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,590
This is getting really bad!

410
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,220
On second thought, I shouldn't
be searching for a perpetrator,

411
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,640
when I'm surrounded by all these egotistical people
who could become perpetrators at any minute!

412
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,620
What do I do?!

413
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,110
What do I do to stop this?!

414
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,340
I need someone's help!

415
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,800
The one person who would never become
a perpetrator in this situation...

416
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,030
I'll have to rely on the guy in 1st!

417
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,910
Huh?

418
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,440
Wh-What is this?!

419
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,510
Something's wrong...

420
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,510
All distorted...

421
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,780
Is this...

422
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,140
Could it be...

423
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,960
[Please wait one moment.]

424
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,710
Sorachi's been taken out!!

425
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,960
[To Be Continued]

426
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,980
[Preview]

427
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,420
And so, since the original
author's been taken out,

428
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,910
the GinTama anime will be off next week.

429
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,980
[Or so we thought, but that wasn't doable. You should give us a break every once in a while, TV Tokyo.]

430
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,940
[The original author's gone and we're out of stock footage. Can we use backgrounds only for the entire episode next week?]

431
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,590
[See you next time.]
