00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,070
Well, this question is from someone pen-named, "Go to hell, Onishi-san."

7
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,920
Gin-san always wears the same kimono. Does he only have one outfit?

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,640
The answer is...

9
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,520
In fact, he has four of the same kimonos, and he washes and wears them in turns.

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,620
What? Why does he have four of the same kimono?

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,540
You know... Because it's confusing if the main character changes his costume a lot.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,140
Lupin the 3rd always wears the same jacket, you know.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,090
Besides, in anime, if the costume is different every episode, you need to draw up a new setting and stuff!

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,050
It's a pain in the ass!

15

That's right. If he can speak out like that, he's fine.

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,930
It reminds me of what the president of some company said:

160
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,060
"A man should lean forward even when falling down."

161
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,540
Burning asphalt... It smells like those cheeks are burning.

162
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,930
I'm really hot! Please help me!

163
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,940
Seriously, my cheeks are hot and it smells like something's burning.

164
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,730
I can't move anymore... Are you listening to me?

165
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,240
Oh, there's the beach!

166
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,490
Guys, let's go.

167
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,950
Yeah!

168

[Danger! Swimming is prohibited!]

169
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,980
Oh? An alien hunt? Huh? Someone actually showed up?

170
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,670
Really?

171
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,510
This will be a big help!

172
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,450
Summer time is the busiest season, you know,

173
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,760
and we're not getting any customers because of the alien! We're really in trouble.

174
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,090
Um... Is that...

175
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,770
...you who posted the bounty...?

176
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,440
Right. That's me.

177
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,810
But I didn't expect anyone to come.

178
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,560
I was kind of joking about it over drinks.

179
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,980
So I never thought somebody would actually come.

180
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:35,090
Joking over drinks?! Hey, we're serious about making money for a living.

181
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,060
A man's gotta put his life on the line even when he's joking-

182
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,230
and we're gonna make sure you keep your end of the deal.

183
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,840
Hey, wait! Calm down!

184
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,240
Don't worry! I'll pay you. I have money.

185
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,960
You liar! Your yakisoba noodles are pathetic.

186
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,010
There's no way a guy like you has any money.

187
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,770
I bet your life must be one big fried noodle.

188
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,990
That's right, go ahead and say it - noodle!

189
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,300
Noodle!

190
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,640
Hey! You can't just eat!
You have to pay for it!

191
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,440
Listen, I'm a man of the sea.

192
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,970
It's true I don't have any money, but I can give you something just as valuable!

193
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,540
Hmm... Then I need to see it first.
We'll get rid of the alien after that.

[Beach Samurai]

196
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,440
Cool shirt, Gin-san.

197
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,750
Right. If I'd worn this as a teenager, it may have been enough to push my mother to domestic violence.

198
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,460
That shirt is

199
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,460
rare and not for sale. Only my staff can wear it.

200
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,650
Now you are all fellow men of the sea!

201
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,740
So release me now! Men of sea don't do this kind of thing!

202
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Gin-san, what are we going to do now?

203
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,750
Well...

204
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,100
We've got no choice but to do it.

205
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,370
We have to do what?

206
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,710
You've got a deserted beach,

207
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,450
one alien, ..and three beach samurai.

208
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,040
Who'll protect the beach if we don't?

209
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,860
When you're down, how do you pick yourself up?

210
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,930
People fall into two categories...depending on how they pick themselves up.

211
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,460
The first kind of person...

212
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,900
comforts himself by seeing somebody who's worse off and thinking,

213
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,690
"Hey, at least I'm better off than that guy."

214
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,400
And the second kind of person...

215
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,580
sees a challenge and tries to raise himself to it.

216
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,940
I belong to the second group.

217
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,700
Since the olden days, whenever I've gotten into trouble, I always come to the ocean.

218
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,890
Helps me realize how tiny I am.

219
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,290
By the way, I met my first wife, Hatsu, at the ocean.

220
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,580
What I'm trying to say is, it's like the sea is my textbook and teacher.

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,140
Everyone has some place in their heart they can fall back on when they need to.

222
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,940
Even if I drift from job to job,

223
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,560
my heart is always here.

224
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,800
And those jobs are the ways I define myself.

225
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,520
Money doesn't matter. I believe that this job is my calling.

226
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,170
Do you understand my feelings?

227
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,160
Huh?

228
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,580
Is that right, sister?

229
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,790
I reached a settlement with the community association.

230
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,740
If we get rid of the alien, they'll give us something in return.

231
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,250
Hey, please listen to me...

232
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,970
Then we gotta be fired up!

233
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,220

235
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,980
Right!

236
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,790
But why do I have to do this?

237
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,590
Did I do something wrong?

238
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,930
I was just cooking fried noodles!

239
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:12,780
Give me a break! My legs are wrinkly. Please help!

240
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,840
I can't catch a thing.

241
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,210
I wonder if it's not in the sea anymore...

242
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,390
I don't think so.

243
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,900
I have a feeling the alien is still in the sea.

244
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,390
I can feel it.

245
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,150
This alien is prepared to fight us. A fight between men.

246
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,850
Breathtaking offense and defense.

247
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,030
And...

248
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,750
It's about man's romance with the sea!

249
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,030
The alien must be waiting for just the right time!

250
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,930
You understand how I feel...

251
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,530
Miss, do you understand my feelings?

252
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,260
Yes, I do.

255
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,750
Um...

256
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,200
You can't fight if you're hungry.

257
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,500
How about another one?

Miss, do you understand... how I feel?

260
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,860
I wish I could swim like them.

261
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,610
I see... You're sensitive to the sun, so you can't go swimming.

262
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,480
But it's best you not be out there.

Don't be shy.

264
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,190
The alien might appear. Are they all right?

265
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,560
Oh, well. If they can't listen to a guy's story then they deserve to die.

266
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,410
Must be nice to swim.

267
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,930
Miss? What are you going to do? Where did you find that?

268

Don't want to watch someone else be happy.
