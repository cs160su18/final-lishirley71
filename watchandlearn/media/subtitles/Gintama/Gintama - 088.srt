[With utter confidence, Ayumu Tojo brings information about Kyubei's frightening plans...]

[Gintoki and his friends are hired to stop Kyubei. What will become of Kyubei's XXX?!]

00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,340
A journal of the Young Master's growth...by Ayumu Tojo.

5
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,670
December 1.

6
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,130
Today, as always, the proper Young Master is noble, dignified and lovely.

7
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,840
Since that incident, her expression seems softer.

8
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,380
Tae-dono's presence has much to do with it.

9
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,400
Despite that scandal, she still maintains a deep friendship with the Young Master as she always has.

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,600
I have a heartfelt admiration for the deepness of her tolerance.

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,760
It is truly heartwarming to see two blooming young ladies

12
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,930
of marriageable age walking together in such a friendly manner.

13
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,960
The Young Master is a girl, after all.

14
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,720
I have taken a long time to get to my point,

15
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,390
but I wish for the Young Master to find her happiness as a girl.

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,550
December 2.

17
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,160
As a slight hint, I placed a Gothic Lolita dress in the Young Master's room.

18
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,710
She burned it.

19
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,030
December 4.

20
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,980
The curtain rail above her curtain came loose, so I went to Loft.

21
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,980
[Note: Loft is a Shibuya, Tokyo based homeowner's department store that carries a variety of household goods.]

22
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,270
December 7.

23
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,740
The time appeared ripe. So I left a Gothic Lolita dress...

24
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,210
She blew it up.

25
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,710
December 10.

26
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,590
The curtain rail above her curtain came loose, so I went to Loft.

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,080
December 12.

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,780
I left a nurse's costume...

29
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,070
She blew it up.

30
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,700
December 14. The curtain rail above her curtain...

31
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,420
She blew it up.

32
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,430
To anyone reading this journal.

33
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,980
The fact that you are reading this means that I am probably no longer of this world.

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,590
However, I believe you can certainly understand my feelings for the Young Master.

35
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,080
I implore you to see my will through...

36
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,200
and make...the Young Master...into a fine young woman...

37
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,290
December 15.

38
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,800
The curtain rail above her curtain came loose, so I went to Loft.

39
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,530
["The Most Exciting Part of a Group Date is Before it Starts"]

40
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,750
What the heck is this? A journal of the Young Master's growth?

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,540
How much free time do you have?

42
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,060
There's nothing in here except how you harassed Kyubei-san and went back and forth from Loft.

43
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,510
What's your obsession with the curtain guy?

44
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,470
Well, there were battles with the Anti-Yagyu and other things,

45
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,900
but it wasn't worth putting in the journal.

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,150
The curtain guy was even more irrelevant!

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,230
I came to ask you because I thought you might be able to help,

48
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,550
being that you know the Young Master's complicated circumstances.

49
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,890
Could you please lend a hand?

50
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,520
It's difficult for us to do anything precisely because we do know the circumstances.

51
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,040
You want someone who was brought up as a man to suddenly become a woman?

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,860
If someone told you to become a woman from today, could you do it?

53
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,650
Huh?

54
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,370
Come back after you've cut your wang off.

55
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,240
Farewell, Ayumu.

56
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,230
Hello, Aya!

57
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,200
[Note: Aya Tojo is one of the heroines from Strawberry 100%, whose name, Tojo, is based off of.]

58
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,200
Wait! Wait! Okay! We get that you're serious!!

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,840
So, what does her father and grandfather have to say?

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,700
They both say to let nature take its course.

61
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,580
The best thing to do is to let the Young Master do as she wishes.

62
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,550
The two of them feel responsible for making her that way, even if they did it to protect her.

63
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,100
That guilt prevents them from taking a strong stand with the Young Master,

64
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,530
and you could say that's what caused the previous incident.

65
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,930
That's why I have to do something!

66
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,930
If the Young Master, despite being a woman,

67
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,670
avoids men and only chases after women, then can she really become happy?!

68
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,170
No!

69
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,710
I understand where you're coming from,

70
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,180
but a hundred people have found a hundred different ways to happiness, right?

71
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,250
If Kyubei-san is happy, isn't it wrong for outsiders to make a fuss about it?

72
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,020
There's no time for that!

73
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,080
Keep quiet, softie!

74
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,300
Wait a minute! Why're you hitting me, Kagura?!

75
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,220
[Note: Shaberiba is a debate/discussion forum TV show.]

76
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,220
Because you tick me off! It felt like the time I watched "Shaberiba"!

77
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,430
It's a race against time.

78
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,430
When I was placing a Gothic Lolita costume in the Young Master's room, I found this.

79
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,990
Plastic surgery?

80
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,050
Could she be looking at...

81
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:26,870
Reconstructive surgery?!

82
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,410
Below that face...?!

83
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,690
Is she planning to erect a filthy Tower of Babel?!

84
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,310
A filthy Tower of Babel? You all have one.

85
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,580
I'll pay you any amount.

86
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,950
I'm asking you once more as a man.

87
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,280
Can I ask for your help in preventing her from erecting a Tower of Babel?

88
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,980
Let's have a group date.

89
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,700
A group date?

90
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,270
It's not going to be easy to change someone who's been living as a man up until now.

91
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,810
But it may be easier to awaken her womanhood.

92
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,610
In other words, have her fall for a man!

93
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,500
That's the only way to prevent her from completing her Tower of Babel.

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,410
Round up...

95
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,110
some men. The chosen Babel warriors!

96
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,720
A group date? Don't be ridiculous.

97
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,490
What am I supposed to say to women I don't even know?

98
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,780
I'm a samurai, you know. I can't participate in such an immoral gathering.

99
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,190
Oh, miss! Won't you work at our club?

100
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,740
You could be our Number One in no time! I mean it. I'm serious!

101
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,880
Come on! What're you doing?!

102
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,340
You're the only one going to all these disreputable places!

103
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,710
What's with that "I did a good job" look?

104
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320
Huh? A group date?

105
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,550
Yes. It's Gin-san's idea.

106
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,500
We'll put together a group on our side, so you'll need to round up some lookers.

107
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,060
My...how nasty. That man's using us as his excuse.

108
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,930
Kyubei-san, by all means, join us. It's a group date, but nothing nasty.

109
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,740
A group date? Is that like a group practice?

110
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,300
No, it's completely different.

111
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
You mustn't go! You can't go!

112
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,290
A group date is like a bleep. It's a sex party!

113
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,280
You mustn't. You absolutely must not.

114
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,090
Who's housekeeper are you?!

115
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,290
Stuff yourself in the ceiling and don't come down!

116
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,000
Kyubei, it's not like that. A group date is like a luncheon.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,130
I see. So we join together after the meal?

118
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,700
That's not incorrect, but please stop that!

119
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,530
Kyu-chan, a group date is a fabulous opportunity to eat and run

120
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,670
without doing anything after making the men treat you to as much food as you want.

121
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,090
Sis! Stop referencing the woman's unabridged dictionary!

122
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,440
But it might be a good opportunity to become familiar with men.

123
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,620
What do you think, Kyu-chan? Want to go?

124
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,040
They're late.

125
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,910
Shinpachi, are you sure you invited them?

126
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,340
I did.

127
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,800
You don't look like you had any success, either.

128
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,270
Where are the Babel warriors?

129
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,550
Babel warriors, my foot!

130
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,820
You and all the others don't seem very enthusiastic.

131
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,040
At this rate, we'll be the ones who'll have to make a move on that kid.

132
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,010
Where's Tojo-san?

133
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,300
If he's around, Kyubei might read our intentions.

134
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,290
He put up a fuss, but I convinced him not to come.

135
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,250
Kagura...

136
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,770
You're our only hope.

137
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,640
Mix in among the women and find out how much they like us.

138
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,190
Remember what I taught you? You go with them to the ladies room and...

139
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,730
Tell me, tell me... Which guy do you like?

140
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,350
For me it's that silver-haired guy. With the naturally wavy hair. He's cute.

141
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,740
No, no. He's cuuute.

142
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,840
He's kyuuute.

143
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,940
No, it's cuute...

144
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,610
My café au lait went down the wrong pipe.

145
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
Kwuute...

146
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,850
That's not right. Didn't I just teach you?

147
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,850
Let's try that again. Ready...

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,620
If you're gonna do it, do it now. Zura.

149
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,760
If you're gonna do it, do it now Zura.

150
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,990
Joi is Joy!

151
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,990
[Note: Joi is another word for Anti-Foreigner Faction.]

152
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,230
Joy is Joi.

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
Now the chorus!

154
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,030
[Joi is...]

155
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,140
No! Sing it! Don't sign it!

156
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,890
I know you talk a lot when I'm not around!

157
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,410
Okay, one more time.

158
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:55,640
Okay...Joy!

159
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,680
Joy!

160
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,760
Oh.

161
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,430
Not "oh." What're you doing here?

162
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,970
You've got it all wrong. This has nothing to do with the group date.

163
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,200
I was trying to promote the Anti-Foreigner Faction via rap.

164
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,790
Shut up! You turned down my invitation and are having a great time!

165
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,310
Why'd you choose rap, of all things?

166
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,560
I don't get the significance. Go kick the bucket.

167
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,910
I beg you-kick the bucket.

168
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,730
[Note: Spoof of Sakurap. Rap by Sakurai from the boys band, Arashi.]

169
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,730
It's not rap, it's Katsurap, yo.

170
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,730
Katsurap my ass. I'll wrap you until you suffocate to death.

171
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,950
I keep telling you, I'm not!

172
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,270
Don't put me in with you. I'm not like you.

173
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,920
You're a stalker, too! A stalker, all right! I'm not.

174
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm always watching over Gin-san!

175
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,300
I'm a fairy-like Tinker Bell! You're a specter-an idiot dick of a specter!

176
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm a fairy, too! No, I mean Otae-san is a fairy! I'm her Peter Pan!

177
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,660
No, you're Putrid Pan!

178
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,660
[Note: Word play on Peter Pan and "pan" the Japanese word for bread.]

179
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,590
No! Peter's Pan!

180
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,200
That's just an ordinary pan!

181
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,340
Hey! Who's responsible?!

182
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,030
Who brought this idiot here? I really want to go home.

183
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,690
Why're you wearing a torn leather jacket on your shoulders?

184
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,800
Are you hot, or are you cold? Make up your mind.

185
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,060
Gin-san, aren't you going to say anything to me? Are you ignoring me?

186
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,870
Sure. You look fine. Cute.

187
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,320
You dropped your leather jacket.

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,610
Oh, thank you.

189
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
What the?

190
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,820
She's here!

191
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,090
[Note: Reference to Dokuganryu Masamune, a famous warrior.]

192
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,920
Why're you dressed like the One-Eyed Dragon?!

193
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,090
Sorry I'm late.

194
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,120
Tae-chan said a group date is like a battle between men and women.

195
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,770
So I came prepared.

196
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,010
What is she expecting the men and women to do?

197
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,370
She really has no idea what a group date is.

198
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,380
Oh, Kyu-chan, you go so overboard. I didn't mean it like that.

199
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,610
I'm sorry I'm late.

200
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,920
I had a tough time, Gin-san, because you said to bring some cute ones.

201
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,590
Right, girls?

202
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,360
Huh? Just a minute. Aren't we missing the cute guys?

203
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,290
Come on, Otae-chan.

204
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,260
You said there'd be some handsome ones.

205
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,230
They're fully armored, but in another sense!

206
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,880
She's got us completely surrounded by foot soldiers!

207
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,500
They're worse than foot soldiers. They're...

208
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,430
zombies soldiers!

209
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,010
You never bring anyone cuter than yourself.

210
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,940
Use zombies to make you stand out! A strategist...she's a strategist!

211
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,110
Looks like we're the ones who didn't know how frightening a group date could be.

212
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,330
We are, without a doubt, on a battlefield!

213
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,060
January 11.

214
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,940
Today, as always, the proper Young Master is noble, dignified and lovely.

215
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,540
The Babel warriors stand to fight over a single young woman.

216
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,770
However, their destination...

217
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,270
The filthy Babel appeared much too tall.

218
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,880
What will become of the Babel warriors?

219
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,440
The outcome, after the commercial.

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,390
Huh? Wasn't this a journal?

221
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,680
Anyway, as for me,

222
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,070
I remembered about the curtain rail for the curtain and headed for Loft.

223
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,800
Thank you for choosing our Yamatoya houseboat today.

224
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,110
On our special course, you will be able to enjoy the view from up in the sky.

225
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,780
What do you think, everyone?

226
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,620
Isn't a costume party in the sky quite something?

227
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,740
You got it wrong.

228
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,860
This is a group date.

229
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,710
Here's what happened in the first half.

230
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,940
Kyubei, an unfortunate child, was born a woman, but raised as a man.

231
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,420
Her steward, Ayumu Tojo brought news of Kyubei's frightening plan,

232
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,190
the building of the Tower of Babel,

233
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,220
open parentheses attaching a penis close parentheses.

234
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,250
In order to prevent this, the Babel warriors,

235
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,910
open parentheses warriors with penises close parentheses

236
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,950
rallied together in an effort to reawaken Kyubei's female sexuality and organized a group date.

237
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,480
The men who gathered for the event were already injured parentheses stupid in the head close parentheses.

238
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,820
In addition, more women, other than Kyubei, gathered.

239
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,790
Can the Babel warriors protect Kyubei's (beep)?

240
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,210
And the fate of the Earth...who cares?

241
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,830
Right now, the final holy battle for the men is about to begin!

242
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,420
It's so oppressive...

243
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,080
What is this oppressive mood?

244
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,420
Gin-san, why won't anyone talk?

245
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,820
Aren't they even going to introduce themselves? Is it okay if I start?

246
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,600
Don't make a thoughtless move!

247
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,390
While the men should certainly take the lead here, if you do...

248
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,220
Okay, there are a lot of familiar faces, so let's start with self-introductions.

249
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,760
If you start things like that, you'll end up in charge of the party, whether you want to be or not.

250
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,930
Even when everyone is enjoying the conversation...

251
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,670
Okay, the second party will be karaoke.

252
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,320
I'll make the reservation.

253
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,950
No, you can't join in.

254
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,400
Or else the opportunity to woo Kyubei will be forever lost.

255
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,000
Bear it for now.

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,820
Someone will always start things because he's unable to bear the silence.

257
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,760
But Gin-san this uncomfortable silence to a helpful guy like me is...unbearable.

258
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,560
Be strong! You're not the only one suffering.

259
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,130
Somebody talk!

260
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,040
I don't want to be in charge of the party! Please... I'll give you 300 yen!

261
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,810
Excuse me.

262
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,410
There's something I'd like to ask you.

263
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,370
Zura!

264
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,170
Thank you. So you'll accept the thankless job?

265
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,750
A self-introduction or anything will do-just get things rolling.

266
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,920
Who in the world am I?

267
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,170
He's not introducing himself-he's questioning his existence!

268
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,040
I have no memory since a few hours ago.

269
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,670
Why am in a place like this? Where is this place?

270
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,530
How would I know? Why are you here, anyways?

271
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,190
["A horse stepped on you earlier so probably since then..."]

272
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,060
I vaguely remember...I was doing a rap or something, but that's all I can recall.

273
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,930
What is this freakish creature?

274
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,620
The truth is, I'm just like you.

275
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,500
All I can remember is cutting the front of my leather jacket.

276
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,420
Who am I?

277
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,960
I seem to remember...I had something to do with protecting the peace on Earth.

278
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,040
Don't go making up memories on your own.

279
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,500
What a coincidence.

280
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,850
I, too, have a feeling that I was protecting the peace on Earth.

281
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,040
You, too? We seem to get along.

282
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,330
Coincidence not! You two are enemies!

283
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,530
Maybe we worked together.

284
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,740
Come to think of it, it doesn't feel like we've just met for the first time.

285
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,750
I feel as though I've been following you for quite some time.

286
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,310
Hey, hey. Looks like this discussion among guys who lost their memories is heating up.

287
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,070
This isn't good, Gin-san. The women have begun talking amongst themselves.

288
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,060
This has turned into a situation where the men and women have completely split up

289
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,670
and are separately having their own good times.

290
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,200
This is bad.

291
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,810
This is no longer a group date.

292
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,510
It's lunchtime in grade school.

293
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,240
The desks are put together, but there is no conversation between the two groups.

294
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,390
The gaps between the desks are deeper than the Mariana Trench.

295
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,020
Gin-san! If this continues, we'll never be able to go over to the other side!

296
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,730
We have to quickly do something.

297
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,470
Gin-san!

298
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,460
Kyu-chan, that's not good.

299
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,370
You've left all your mushrooms.

300
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,240
I don't like them. Their shape makes me feel sick.

301
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,740
That's!

302
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,780
Hey.

303
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,350
Give me those mushrooms.

304
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,350
So wasteful! I'll eat them. Give them to me.

305
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,110
He jumped!

306
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,080
He's the only one who can cross the gap between the desks without a second thought!

307
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,150
The school boss!

308
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,220
His vulgar behavior rains down on both the boys and girls without discrimination.

309
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:39,500
His crude kindness shines like sunlight on both the boys and the girls.

310
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,240
C'mon, hurry. The teacher will see you.

311
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,840
Thanks.

312
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,840
The gap closes...

313
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,480
before their very eyes..

314
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,180
[Note: There is a Japanese superstition regarding passing something to another person using chopsticks. This is because such practice is only used when picking up cremated bones.]

315
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,710
You shouldn't pass food between chopsticks!

316
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,960
Wha....

317
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,180
What?! That gap was closing, but now it's...

318
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,310
That's...

319
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,610
The class president!

320
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,660
The only one who can control the class boss...the class president!

321
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,000
That's very poor manners, you two.

322
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
You're way worse!

323
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,400
But this is bad.

324
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,720
Even the class boss can't hold his ground against Otae-chan,

325
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,000
the class president and captain of the kendo club with her skills and good looks.

326
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,670
He was just about to befriend the cool, boyish transfer student,

327
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,240
Yagyu-san, but now Yagyu-san's heart has drifted away!

328
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,800
At this rate...!

329
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,320
They're...!

330
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,550
Things are heating up.

331
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,750
Could it be you're jealous, Otae-chan?

332
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,220
The Ugly Sisters!

333
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,470
They're a group of she-leopards who have twice the interest in love, but half the opportunities.

334
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,400
So they go around sticking their noses into everyone's love affairs and messing them up.

335
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,230
So is this your type, Otae-chan?

336
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,020
No. That's not what this is about.

337
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,180
This is bad.

338
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,730
The class president is out of touch when it comes to love. Can she handle the pressure?

339
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,390
The desks are moving apart!

340
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,470
The chasm between the boys and girls is growing larger!

341
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,570
There's no other way-I have to do this. Even if it means a fight.

342
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,480
They must continue talking.

343
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,300
That's enough, girls! That's what you all say.

344
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,480
But the truth is, you all like Gin-san, don't you?!

345
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,760
That's...

346
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,960
not true.

347
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,700
This is the pits! What terrible fact did you dig up in all this confusion?!

348
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,430
Wait...I was...after the one with one eye...

349
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,480
Oh!

350
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,900
Ouch. There you are.

351
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,530
Oops, I banged my glasses on my book.

352
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,610
That's...the bumbling librarian!

353
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,000
The bumbling woman who always watched the class boss

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,170
reading health and phys ed books from the shadows of the library.

355
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,160
She's the masochistic librarian!

356
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,540
Huh? Were you talking about me?

357
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,100
Oh no! I should've been more specific-one eye with black hair.

358
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,860
Well?

359
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,910
Looks good. Like a rocker.

360
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,050
Shall we try it together then?

361
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,100
What're you doing-ignoring the women?!

362
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,110
We were probably blending rap and rock to sing for peace on Earth.

363
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,330
We can't rely on the government or revolutionaries.

364
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,070
We have to win true peace through song.

365
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,110
What're a police officer and the Anti-Foreigner Faction leader talking about?!

366
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,110
One, two, three, four...

367
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,210
If you're gonna do it, do it now. Zura.

368
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,580
If you're gonna do it, do it now. Zura.

369
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,680
Joi is Joy. Joy is Joi.

370
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,160
Divine punishment comes to kill you!

371
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Just a minute! Wait.

372
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,660
I don't get it! It's hard to play along. What's this with Anti-Foreigner Faction?

373
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,170
I don't know why, but I'm tearing up.

374
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,130
Wh-What's this?

375
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,090
They've fought for years, punched each other out,

376
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,590
and understood each other, playing soccer with a baseball.

377
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,280
The captains of the baseball and soccer teams.

378
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,120
That's why I'm telling you "Official police bust" is better than "Divine punishment"!

379
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,050
That's too long! How am I supposed to sing to "Official police bust"?!

380
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,250
Official police bust!

381
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:40,900
Divine punishment!

382
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,840
Official police bust!

383
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,850
Divine punishment!

384
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,780
Official police bust!

385
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,090
Divine punishment!

386
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,480
Official police bust!

387
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,920
Divine punishment!

388
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,060
Official police bust!

389
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,300
Divine punishment!

390
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,720
Official police bust!

391
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,570
Divine punishment!

392
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
The boat!

393
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,640
Forgive me, but I'll need you to behave yourselves for a bit.

394
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,410
They say a man and a woman who share a frightening experience often fall in love.

395
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,610
They mistake the violent pounding of their fearful hearts for the throbbing heart of affection.

396
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,340
Young Master!

397
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,120
I will never allow you to build a Tower of Babel!

398
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,620
We're going to die!

399
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,620
What's going on? Did we get into an accident?!

400
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,760
Hey, that's...!

401
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,090
Kyubei-san!!

402
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,060
We have to save her! But how?

403
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,670
Pachi-san! When a woman makes up her mind, she can fall for someone just like that!

404
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,070
So go!

405
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,890
Me?! No way! No way!

406
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,540
There's no way I can do it either, stupid!

407
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,490
I've got to try!

408
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,720
Kyubei!

409
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,450
I'm coming to save you! Hold on a bit longer!

410
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,260
No! I can't stand to be touched by a man!

411
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:55,260
[Note: Kyubei has an involuntary violent reaction when a man touches her.]

412
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,260
This is no time to be saying that!

413
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,190
This man! He tried to save me, even as he was being thrown off...

414
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,160
You touched me.

415
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,860
That was rash! Did you believe I would extend my hand?

416
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,980
I didn't think you'd touch a man unless I did something like this.

417
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,600
I thought I went through a lot of trouble for nothing.

418
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,020
But no...this is a lovely woman's hand.
