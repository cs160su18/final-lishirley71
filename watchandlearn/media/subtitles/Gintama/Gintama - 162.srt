2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,530
Hey, everybody! Good nightingale!

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:08,520
I'm still having so much trouble releasing a CD in real life.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,100
And there's only one match left in the three-match pianist battle

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,690
to decide Tsu Terakado's official fan club!

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,690
In the first match, the quiz showdown,

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,910
Kondo-san made a perfect read to deliver victory for the Tsusengumi!

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,460
In the second match, the charisma showdown,

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,710
victory went to the Tsu Terakado Fan Club who invited me to the Gandara Vehotel!

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,730
And today will be the last match!

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,430
Which team will show their true love for me?

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,410
Aww!

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,970
Now I'm starting to get nervous!

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,870
Sorry, can I go take a piss?

15
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,990
The three-match contest to decide Tsu Terakado's official fan club

16
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,170
has finally reached its final match!

17
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,950
Only two teams out of the many fans made it to the finals!

18
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,140
The Tsu Terakado Fan Club!

19
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,100
On the other side, we have the team led by Mr. Toshi, which has lived up to its name!

20
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,970
The Tsusengumi!

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Each team has one win and one loss.

22
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,870
We've been watching a back-and-forth battle here,

23
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,150
but everything will be decided by this final match!

24
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,830
Now, the final battle will begin!

25
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,340
Representatives from both teams enter the ring!

26
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,340
["Love Is Unconditional"]

27
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,310
Shinpachi.

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,560
There's nothing left for us to do.

29
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,370
From here on, this is your battle.

30
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,220
I can't lose.

31
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,450
I can't afford to lose.

32
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,060
For the sake of everyone who's helped bring me here,

33
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,410
I absolutely have to win!

34
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,350
You've been a big help.

35
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,390
I'll buy you dinner some time.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,860
Toshi, failure is not allowed.

37
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,050
Take back your own self with your own hands!

38
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,780
I will stand above all otaku.

39
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,850
I will take this body back from Toshi.

40
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,790
Let's finish this.

41
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,310
The third and final match will test your collecting abilities!

42
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,300
We aren't boxing?

43
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,670
As fans, you naturally have assembled all kinds of paraphernalia

44
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,540
related to your dear Otsu-chan.

45
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,570
How hardcore have you been in gathering Otsu-chan paraphernalia?

46
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,150
That will be the key to this contest!

47
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,440
This is what we will be using today, Otsu chips!

48
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,580
Otsu chips!

49
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,530
Chips that aren't selling very well, or quite frankly, they aren't selling at all.

50
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,370
We will have a card battle using the bonus cards that come with these chips!

51
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,650
A-A card battle?!

52
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,840
The rules are simple.

53
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,430
These cards have images of Otsu-chan in various poses.

54
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,830
The cards have been assigned AP, attack points, and DP, defense points.

55
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,030
Why would idol cards have attack power and defense power?!

56
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,690
We will place them on this live stage...

57
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,950
And you will fight through these holograms of Otsu-chan!

58
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,790
Why is fighting even involved?!

59
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,770
And between two Otsu-chans?!

60
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,340
Each player will be given 2000 life points.

61
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,410
For each turn, you will each use a card,

62
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,930
and the corresponding number of life points will be spent.

63
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,640
The team whose life points reach zero first loses!

64
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,950
And we won't be providing any cards!

65
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,290
As fans, you naturally have these cards on your person.

66
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,530
The cards you have on you right now will be your playing hand!

67
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,220
N-Not good!

68
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,470
I don't have a single one of those cards!

69
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,510
Hell, I never even knew they were being sold!

70
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,860
And didn't that bag say it was Indian Corn-poop flavored?!

71
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,580
Are those even edible?!

72
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,780
No, wait.

73
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,090
Hijikata-san couldn't possibly have any of these cards...

74
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,400
Please set your cards and shuffle!

75
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,440
Hi-Hijikata!

76
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,100
Why do you have those?!

77
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,690
And so many!

78
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,310
Hijikata-san, whose coolness is his strength,

79
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,450
has that many Otsu chips cards!

80
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,160
I will abandon shame and self-respect to take myself back.

81
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,910
You can't conquer the otaku world by being half-hearted.

82
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,950
Hijikata-san...

83
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,490
What dreadful tenacity...

84
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,550
This is bad...

85
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,210
I can't put up a fight without any cards!

86
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,580
Then, let the duel begin!

87
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,930
Gin-san, run to the store!

88
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,400
Buy lots of Otsu chips right away!

89
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,080
I'm on it!

90
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,460
So you didn't have any...as I expected.

91
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,960
It's too late to try and assemble a deck now!

92
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,480
I have a complete set up to the third series of Otsu chips!

93
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,240
I'll finish this before you get any cards!

94
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,200
This is my card!

95
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,540
Mr. Toshi from the Tsusengumi makes the first move!

96
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,610
His card is!

97
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,690
Sentimental five minutes before curtain.

98
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,990
Otsu in her dressing room right before the beginning of a concert.

99
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,580
She's a nervous wreck.

100
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,230
She will indiscriminately attack anyone if given the opportunity.

101
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,180
(Especially Kimura.)

102
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,580
460 attack points.

103
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,100
3 defense points.

104
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,920
What kind of card is that?!

105
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,760
You're revealing way too much stuff people don't want to hear about an idol!

106
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,670
And who the hell is Kimura?!

107
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,050
Mr. Toshi has chosen an attack card to begin with!

108
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,480
Don't come in my dressing room without permission!

109
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,840
Why is a hologram attacking a real person?!

110
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,800
And who the hell is she?!

111
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,550
This doesn't look anything like the original!

112
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,920
She looks like a totally different person!

113
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,680
Mr. Shimura can do nothing against the Otsu-chan hologram!

114
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,130
It is Mr. Shimura's turn!

115
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,570
If he doesn't make a move, he'll lose a large number of life points

116
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,690
Shinpachi!

117
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Gin-san!

118
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,030
You made it in time!

119
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,130
I don't have time to choose a card!

120
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll go with this!

121
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,540
Oh!

122
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,500
This is...!

123
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,890
This card is...!

124
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,270
I don't have time to choose a card!

125
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,440
I'll go with this!

126
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,760
Oh!

127
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,510
This is...!

128
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,770
This card is...!

129
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,360
Oh! This card is...!

130
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,760
KIM!

131
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,230
KIM the bass player!

132
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,640
Uh, who the hell is that?!

133
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,810
KIM the bass player.

134
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,900
A member of Otsu's backing band, which supports Otsu behind the scenes.

135
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,990
The bass player who also occasionally plays the castanets.

136
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,790
Why does it feel like I pulled a pointlessly plain card?!

137
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,050
What are its attack points?!

138
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,730
Does it have some kind of special ability?!

139
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,350
The mole on his face occasionally vanishes,

140
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,650
but he's an enigmatic figure who remains silent when asked about it.

141
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,450
(And his real name isn't KIM, but Chutaro Kimura.)

142
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,190
So it's Kimura!

143
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,170
It's the Kimura that Otsu-chan is always spazzing on about!

144
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,240
He was clearly getting his mole taken off by Otsu-chan!

145
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,710
This card is a support card with no attack points or defense points!

146
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,460
Its effect is to piss off all Otsu cards in play and double their attack points!

147
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,760
Sentimental five minutes before curtain's attack points have doubled to 920!

148
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,930
Hey, what's with the mole?

149
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,670
Is it some kind of switch?

150
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,680
It's a damn eyesore!

151
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,420
Mr. Shimura makes a painful mistake!

152
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,880
He ended up using a support card to double the attack power of his opponent's card!

153
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,240
He has lost nearly half of his life points!

154
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,450
Shinpachi!

155
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,680
[Note: Kagura and Gintoki are dressed as Danpei, who is the manager and corner man from boxing manga Tomorrow's Joe (Ashita no Joe).]

156
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,100
What are you doing, fool?!

157
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,680
You gotta throw inside punches!

158
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,280
And this support card, KIM the bass player, lasts for five turns!

159
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,580
Hey, scram!

160
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,700
Stupid Kimura!

161
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,840
If Mr. Shimura is attacked by a card with doubled attack points in the next turn,

162
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,150
he has no chance of victory!

163
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,850
As if double attack power was all you had to worry about.

164
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,260
My turn!

165
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,770
I'll teach you how you're supposed to use support cards!

166
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,020
This is my next card!

167
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,470
Oh!

168
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,520
This card is...!

169
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,860
That day of the month!

170
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,610
That day of the month.

171
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,450
Aggravate all female cards and triple their attack points.

172
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,490
However, you cannot play a card the next time.

173
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,400
Which day is that day of the month?!

174
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,720
Is this really an idol card game?!

175
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,750
And is it actually okay to show this on TV?!

176
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,940
Mr. Toshi has added that day of the month to an Otsu-chan

177
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,760
already irritated by KIM the bass player to leave her in the worst possible mood!!

178
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,750
What?!

179
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,200
And her attack power is now 2,760!

180
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,770
An amazing number!

181
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,960
If Mr. Shimura is hit with an attack, he'll lose in one blow!

182
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,150
I have to do something!

183
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,280
Shinpachi!

184
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,990
Here's more Otsu chips!

185
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,320
Come on!

186
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,330
Give me a good card!

187
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,370
Gin-san.

188
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,390
Are these really Otsu chips?

189
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
Are you sure you didn't get Kimura chips by accident?

190
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,230
Shinpachi!

191
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,720
You can only have five cards in a hand!

192
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,760
Bet everything on the last one!

193
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,970
An Otsu card!

194
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,270
I'm going to draw an Otsu card!

195
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,450
If I have an Otsu card,

196
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,110
I can receive the effects from KIM the bass player and that day of the month

197
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,250
and put up a fight against that monster!

198
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,140
It's no use.

199
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,370
Cheap tricks won't do anything against this strike.

200
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,570
Go!

201
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,290
Otsu on that day of the month!

202
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,860
A clean hit!

203
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,710
Mr. Shimura has taken a direct 2,760 attack hit!

204
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,420
It's all over.

205
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,120
Wh-What?!

206
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,570
I-Impossible!

207
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,400
You...

208
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,070
Why are you...

209
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,120
Over there?!

210
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,010
Oh!

211
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,530
The support card, KIM the bass player, took the hit for Mr. Shimura!

212
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,060
Impossible...

213
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,130
How could a support card like you enter combat...?

214
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,890
Much less endure a 2,760 attack point hit...!

215
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,000
That's...

216
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,760
It can't be!

217
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,520
Separation..

218
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,520
A support card that only works on KIM the bass player.

219
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,670
Sacrifice the mole to withstand one attack by Otsu-chan.

220
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,100
K-KIM-san!

221
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,330
KIM the bass player sacrificed his mole to protect Mr. Shimura!

222
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,410
I-It can't be!

223
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,330
I didn't expect that!

224
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,170
Mr. Toshi cannot use a card next turn because of that day of the month!

225
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,460
Have the tables been turned?!

226
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,570
KIM-san, hang in there!

227
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,990
Avenge my mole...

228
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,460
KIM-san!

229
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,980
You just lost your mole!

230
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,030
Hang in there!

231
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,640
Why?!

232
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,650
I don't get it!

233
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,750
Okay, it's Mr. Shimura's turn again!

234
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,440
He can't let this chance slip away!

235
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,650
He must draw a good card by any means!

236
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,950
Hijikata-san is completely helpless, unable to use a support card.

237
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,590
This is my chance to strike back!

238
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,910
An Otsu-chan card!

239
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,830
Draw an Otsu-chan card this time!

240
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,040
Please!

241
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,160
Come on!

242
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,380
Come on!

243
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,750
Oh! This is...

244
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,500
That card is...!

245
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,730
KIYOSHI!

246
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,390
KIYOSHI the drummer!

247
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,930
I got another worthless-looking one!

248
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,920
KIYOSHI the drummer.

249
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,980
A member of Otsu's backing band, which supports Otsu behind the scenes.

250
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,270
The drummer who also occasionally plays the tambourine.

251
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,760
He used to be close with KIM the bass player,

252
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,880
but they got in a fight the other day when someone ate an extra slice of pizza,

253
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,180
and they're looking for an opportunity to make up.

254
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,190
Who cares about that?!

255
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,040
Do that stuff in the dressing room!

256
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,640
Don't bring it into the game!

257
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,990
If you have a pizza card, they'll make up and have a session.

258
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,590
Like I said, who cares?!

259
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,550
Or if you have a cash card, they'll become even closer than they were before.

260
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,290
Don't use money to settle it!

261
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,100
What is it?

262
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,210
Don't look this way.

263
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,170
I wasn't looking at you.

264
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,400
This is really awkward.

265
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,820
What's with these guys?

266
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,230
Why did they show up?

267
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,780
It appears that he wasn't able to take advantage of his lucky chance.

268
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,160
You have no chance of victory now.

269
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,660
The time has finally come.

270
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,360
It's been a long time.

271
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,230
After obtaining that demonic sword and becoming cursed,

272
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,450
I had to frantically suppress my other self, Toshi, who would pop up at any chance...

273
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,540
The next thing I knew, I had a growing pile of figures and DVDs...

274
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,850
And was being greeted on the street by strange otaku on a daily basis...

275
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,920
I will end it all with this blow!

276
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,810
I'll end it all with this card!

277
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,550
This is...the end!

278
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,040
Go!

279
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,300
MIYABI the stylist.

280
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,590
A stylist with a bad attitude.

281
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,520
Regularly eats and steals stuff from the dressing room without permission.

282
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,920
Otsu's deadly foe.

283
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,040
Only works on Otsu in dressing room cards.

284
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,260
Plus 1,000 attack points and defense points.

285
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,990
This time, it's over.

286
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,250
You ready?

287
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,160
As expected from the brilliant strategist, Toshiro Hijikata...

288
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,150
He has me completely backed into a corner.

289
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,600
But...

290
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,750
I can't afford to lose!

291
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,930
The feelings of everyone who has helped me...

292
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,910
Gin-san, Kagura-chan...

293
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,620
And Taka-tin.

294
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,450
Plus Taka-chin.

295
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,020
And most importantly...

296
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,750
My feelings of love and complete trust in Otsu-chan...

297
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,700
I can't let them down!

298
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,530
I'll stake my all on this card!

299
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,500
A mystery investigating card?!

300
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,510
Reveal a hidden truth to change parameters!

301
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,510
Damn it.

302
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,200
Another weird card in the end...

303
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,700
You're out of options.

304
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,710
Die!

305
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,730
Damn it!

306
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,210
I'll just have to leave it to fate!

307
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,380
Go!

308
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,640
Mystery investigating card activate.

309
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,930
Allow me to tell you the hidden truth.

310
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,740
The one who secretly ate your pizza...

311
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,900
The one who secretly ate your pizza...

312
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,170
Was this fatass!

313
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,660
Ichi, ni...

314
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,610
Ichi, ni, three, four!

315
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,750
Begin makeup session.

316
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,060
This is...

317
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,740
Makeup session.

318
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,200
A performance to bring peace on Earth!

319
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,120
You are unable to attack, but if you're attacked,

320
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,070
the attack points are doubled and the attack is reflected!

321
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,920
[To Be Continued]

322
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,840
[Shiruko and Zenzai]

323
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,510
You just sometimes get in the mood

324
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,600
for some hot shiruko, even when it isn't winter.

325
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,340
[Note: Zenzai(sweet bean soup): made from condensed paste with heat and is less watery than shiruko(red bean soup) which is more akin to jam or marmalade.]

326
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,950
And yeah, I can't really tell the difference between shiruko and zenzai.

327
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,340
Why do they have to make it so complicated?

328
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,060
Just call them the same name.

329
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,780
Why bother differentiating?

330
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,860
Yeah, it's hard to tell the difference.

331
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,170
[Note: Yu Aoi is a popular mainstream actress. Sora Aoi is a Japanese porn star.]

332
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,540
And there's Yu Aoi and Sora Aoi.

333
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,170
They might as well be the same person.

334
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,870
I get them confused at times.

335
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,980
No, their names just sound similar.

336
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,330
They're different people.

337
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,880
I'm thinking that they're talking about, y'know,

338
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,690
but then they're actually talking about some fancy movie.

339
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,280
It leaves my face burning.

340
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,480
I don't want to endure another ordeal like that.

341
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,860
[Note: Rinka is a Japanese model and TV personality.]

342
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,860
And yeah, can Rinka clone herself or something?

343
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,390
There are like five or six of them on TV.

344
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,330
I can't tell which one's which.

345
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,370
Can't they just combine into one giant Rinka?

346
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,010
And I can't tell the difference between GinTama and Kintama.

347
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,010
[Note: Kintama is slang for "balls" in Japanese.]

348
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,070
Which one's the right ball and which one's the left ball?

349
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,880
[The End]

350
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:16,850
[Preview]

351
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,280
Thanks, Toshiro...

352
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,970
But that's enough...

353
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,550
I'll handle the rest...

354
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,500
The next episode...

355
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,890
"The Black Ships Even Make A Scene When They Sink."

356
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,690
[Toshi dangerously appears from within Toshiro! On to the next showdown in the Official Fan Club battle!]

357
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,820
[By the way, there are many differences between Shiruko and Zenzai depending on whether you're in the Kanto or Kansai area. Google them for more details.]

358
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:35,190
