00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,420
I never expected...

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,730
Ito to be allied with them...

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,020
I need to tell the Vice-Chief immediately.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,150
The Vice-Chief!

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,580
Please...

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,480
The Shinsengumi... My...
Our Shinsengumi...

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,880
Protect it.

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,450
Please...

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,440
Kondo-san, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,460
Your flag has become pitch black.

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,440
As expected, Sensei...

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,300
You say interesting things.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,770
We've become pitch black?

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,770
I don't know about those around you...

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,910
But they're different.
They can't be called a color.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,090
If anything, they're grime.

18
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,590
They're stains that you can't remove,
no matter how much you wash.

19
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,730
They can't be colored or
affected by anything.

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,400
Okita-kun, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be keeping watch.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,220
What are you doing?

22
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,530
I'm asking you what you're
doing, you piece of shit.

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,140
Okita-kun...

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,200
How dare you talk like that to Ito Sensei?!

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
Let go.

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,180
I said, let go of him!!

this plan, Gintoki and the others chase after the train.]

Strengths and Weaknesses"]

30
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,380
Sogo...

31
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,840
Okita-kun, so you really were
part of Hijikata's faction.

32
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,600
You were a spy who got close to me
to find out what I was going to do.

33
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,670
Your betrayal of Hijikata was
all an act to fool me.

34
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,670
That wasn't an act.

35
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,940
I told you... All I want is to be Vice-Chief.
I'll crush anyone who gets in my way.

36
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:23,140
Hijikata disappeared... You're next, Ito Sensei.

37
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,620
I don't want to work under him
or you. I have only one boss.

38
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,630
Out of the way! That spot
by his side is mine!!

39
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,080
How ill-natured. You used
me to get rid of Hijikata.

40
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,780
And, now that I'm of no use,
you're going to get rid of me.

41
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,160
Why not? I have the same idea as you.

42
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,330
Kondo-san!! At this rate, Kondo-san
will be assassinated!!

43
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,390
It's none of my concern...
It's none of my concern...

44
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,330
It's none of my concern...

45
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,670
Hijikata-san!! Get a hold
of yourself, Hijikata-san!!

46
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,170
It's none of my concern...
It's of no concern...

47
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,070
At this rate, you may lose all
the people and things...

48
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,220
You hold dear!!

49
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,440
It's of no concern... It's
none of my concern...

50
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,650
Gin-chan, what should we do?

51
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,470
Please protect...

52
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,430
Our Shinsengumi...

53
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,240
Kagura, patch us through to
headquarters and all cars.

54
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
Aye, aye, sir.

55
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,000
Umm... Hello? Can you hear
me you tax thieves?

56
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,750
I'm not sure if it's the Ito faction
or the Mayonnaise faction...

57
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,380
But I'm saying this to
all of you tax thieves!

58
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,690
Immediately leave your posts and
go after the train that Kondo's on.

59
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,190
If you waste time, your boss...

60
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,710
Might be killed.

61
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,830
This is an order. Those
who ignore this order...

62
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,760
Will have to commit seppuku for
not standing by their bushido.

63
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,930
Is this a prank?! Who are you?!

64
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,020
Who do you think you're
talking to? Who am I?

65
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,160
This is Shinsengumi Vice-Chief
Toshiro Hijikata, damn it!!

66
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,390
Humph!

67
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,630
Gin-san...

68
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,580
I'm sick of seeing that cowardly face.

69
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,570
This is convenient.

70
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,640
If the Shinsengumi is going to disappear,
you can disappear with them.

71
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,790
I'll send you to your grave.

72
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,790
No way! I'm not going!

73
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,690
I wasn't talking to you!!

74
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,880
Hey, are you listening? Are you?

75
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,760
Don't retreat and shove your
problems onto other people!!

76
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,540
Are you the type that asks
things of others?

77
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,670
Are you the type that

78
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,530
shoves the fate of your Shinsengumi
onto someone else?

79
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,300
If you're going to die,

80
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,850
die while swinging your sword along side
the things that are important to you!!

81
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,460
That's who you are!!

82
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
That hurts...

83
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,920
I told you, that hurts!!

84
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,560
Could it be?

85
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,120
Could it be?!

86
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,640
Ito Sensei, the train is on fire! It's
dangerous for us to stay here!

87
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,970
Don't stop the train!! If we
stop, Kondo will escape.

88
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,430
Everyone on this train aside from
those two are our allies.

89
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,130
As long as this train continues
moving, they're trapped like rats.

90
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,200
Sorry, Sogo. It's all my
fault this happened.

91
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,860
How can I make it up
to you? How can I...

92
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,250
apologize to you...to Toshi?
How can I apologize?

93
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,130
Sogo!!

94
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you doing, Sogo?! Open up!!

95
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,880
Kondo-san...

96
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,510
If our boss is killed, we'll lose this battle.

97
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,540
Please stay here.

98
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,520
No way!!

99
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,230
Kondo-san, I've constantly told you

100
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,630
that the bad thing about you is
that you're too good a person.

101
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,110
You believe anyone and
never doubt them.

102
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,060
In the end, a fox like him
ended up by your side.

103
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,710
Well, I expected this would
happen sooner or later.

104
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,720
But because you're like that,
we gathered around you...

105
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,170
Because you're like that,
we fought with you.

106
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,530
Because you're like that...

107
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,770
You're worth risking my life to protect.

108
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,770
Sogo! Wait!!

109
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,280
If you die, I... I...

110
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,300
Sogo!!

111
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,040
Okita-kun, I thought you
were smarter than that.

112
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,770
Do you plan to fight us all by yourself?

113
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,950
You let Kondo escape and remained
behind with the enemy.

114
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,530
Do you plan to die a heroic death?

115
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:10,520
Unfortunately, Kondo is going
to die according to my plans.

116
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,370
We aren't the only ones
on this battlefield.

117
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,540
The Kiheitai, huh?

118
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,810
Sorry, Ito-san. Actually,
I'm not alone either.

119
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,800
Impossible... That's...

120
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,090
This is a raid!!

121
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,160
All of you surrender quietly!!

122
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,160
Hijikata?!

123
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,040
Why is he here?!

124
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,640
Can't you act cool for just a little longer?!

125
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,150
I can't, I can't! It's impossible
for me! I'm scared!!

126
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,280
In order to raise the morale of your allies,

127
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,840
you need to show them that their
Vice-Chief is still kicking!!

128
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,440
You've got to be kidding me! You only
reverted back when you hit me?!

129
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,300
Tsk... A bunch of eyesores
have crawled out...

130
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,870
But an army isn't enough
to take them down.

131
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,920
Hijikata...

132
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,870
What can he do by showing up now?
I'll wipe them all out, including Kondo.

133
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,270
You're the ones who are
going to get wiped out.

134
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,710
I see some faces I know.

135
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,660
I hope you're prepared to
die for joining that side.

136
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,460
Shinsengumi Regulation Article 21...

137
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,050
Those who have been secretly conspiring
with the enemy shall be punished!

138
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,800
I'll take down all of you.

139
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,410
Don't you see the situation you're in?

140
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,130
Here, I'm the faction in power.

141
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,740
You're the rebel.

142
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,310
The laws that he created have
no meaning anymore.

143
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,440
Your Shinsengumi will disappear.

144
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,010
Get rid of him.

145
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,160
Yes!

146
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,300
As the First Squad Captain
of the Shinsengumi,

147
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,860
I shall give you your final lesson.

148
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,360
When faced with an enemy who
is considerably more powerful,

149
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,650
it is best to overcome that power
with sheer numbers.

150
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,340
Synchronize your breathing.

151
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,180
Build up spirit in your heart and body.

152
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,090
When you are at your peak...

153
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,590
Attack all at once!!

154
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,460
And...!!

155
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,880
Die.

156
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,660
Are those Anti-Foreigner
Faction members?

157
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,530
Jeez... It looks like it wasn't
just an internal squabble.

158
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,620
Kondo-san...

159
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,340
Where in the world is Kondo-san?!

160
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,380
There!

161
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,640
That car that's moving
far behind the train!

162
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,280
All the enemies are headed there!

163
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,110
That's the situation, Mr. Hijikata.
Take care of the rest yourself!!

164
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,150
Hey, wait, Mr. Sakata!

165
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,700
Are you planning to leave me here?!

166
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,190
[Note: Parody of Dragon Ball. Yamcha
is thought of as the weakest character.]

167
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,190
That's as reckless as sending Mr. Yamcha
to Planet Namek by himself.

168
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,640
And leaving him to decide
the fate of the universe!!

169
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,310
It's all right! You're Vegeta!!
You can do it if you try!

170
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,310
[Note: Parody of Dragon Ball. Vegeta
is one of the strong characters.]

171
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,340
Mr. Sakata!!

172
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,170
Vice-Chief!!

173
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,040
It's the Vice-Chief!

174
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,910
The Vice-Chief is all right!!

175
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,740
No matter how you look
at this, I'm not all right!!

176
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,900
So you've finally come.

177
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,650
I was getting sick of taking care
of him. Take him already.

178
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,620
He's caused us a lot of trouble.

179
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,230
Have the shogunate transfer the
reward into my bank account.

180
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,540
Ito, that bastard, has finally
shown his true self!!

181
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,030
But we're all right now that
the Vice-Chief is back!!

182
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,030
Hey, are you listening? Transfer my
reward into my bank account...

183
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:29,980
Vice-Chief, we shall confront the enemy.
You save the Chief in the meantime.

184
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,640
Let's go!!

185
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,060
Hey, wait!!

186
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,380
Hey, wait, damn it!

187
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,480
Something weird has happened
to your Vice-Chief.

188
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,420
Listen to me, baldy!!

189
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,070
Those guys... Why?

190
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,360
Why?!

191
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,120
You idiot... Why are you...

192
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,080
Why are you here?

193
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,800
I treated you so badly.

194
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,870
Why did you come all this way for me?

195
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,780
Toshi!

196
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,230
Why did you come?

197
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,350
You idiot!

198
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,020
Huh?

199
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,620
Kondo-san, are you all right?

200
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,960
It's no good. He's not here.

201
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,420
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

202
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,970
Oh, there he is! Are you all right?

203
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,630
Hey, it seems that people are really
trying to assassinate you.

204
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,640
No, I was almost killed by you just now!!

205
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,650
Could it be that you dragged
Toshi all the way here?

206
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,890
This is impossible. You help us?

207
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,060
It was his last request.

208
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,360
His last request?

209
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,020
His soul was devoured
by a demonic sword.

210
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,530
Right now, he's just a hopeless otaku.

211
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,380
He won't return ever again.

212
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,910
A demonic sword?

213
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,090
Toshi?!

214
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,090
Pretty Samurai Tomoe 5000 is here!

215
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,370
Damn it!!

216
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:57,750
If all of Toshi's unexplainable actions were
the result of the demonic sword...

217
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,020
To Love-Ru is really great, isn't it?

218
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,030
While in that state, what
did Toshi ask you to do?

219
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,270
He asked us to protect the Shinsengumi.

220
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,340
It would be a pain to do that, so I brought
him here and told him to do it himself.

221
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,430
Our job ends here. I want you
to transfer the reward to me.

222
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,020
I will... I'll give you all of my savings...

223
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,110
But, Odd Jobs, I have a request for you.

224
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,660
Consider this a last request as well.

225
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,530
Take Toshi and run away.

226
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,890
It's my fault this happened.

227
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,010
I don't want Toshi to get involved
in this battle in his current state.

228
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,700
I ignored Toshi's advice to be wary of Ito.

229
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:06,210
Furthermore, I punished Toshi for
a petty blunder on Ito's advice.

230
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,610
I never even knew that this
was happening to him.

231
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,360
I didn't know that he was trying to protect
the Shinsengumi, even in his condition.

232
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,410
I didn't know that, despite his
pride, he lowered his head...

233
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,720
And entrusted the Shinsengumi to you.

234
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,970
I'm sorry, Toshi... I'm sorry, everyone...

235
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,440
I...I'm...a big idiot...

236
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,740
Tell all the cars to immediately
leave the battlefront.

237
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,570
Isao Kondo has died in battle.

238
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,080
I don't want my friends to fight
each other any more.

239
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,840
Gentlemen of the Yamato,
our Chief, Isao Kondo...

240
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,840
[Note: Spoof of the Space Battleship Yamato anime series.]

241
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,480
has been safely rescued.

242
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,690
Victory is within our grasp!

243
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,320
We shall get revenge on

244
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,400
[Note: Spoof of GUNDAM series anime.]

245
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,400
that lawless bunch for besmirching
our Chief's name. Let me say this.

246
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,270
They are all scum!

247
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,050
In the name of the moon...

248
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,630
[Spoof of Sailor Moon.]

249
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,630
We will punish them!!

250
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,430
Hey, who's that? Who's making that silly speech?

251
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,870
Who am I? I'm Shinsengumi Vice-Chief...

252
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,010
Toshiro Hijikata nari!!

253
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,010
[Note: Suffix "Nari" was used by Samurai and by
Korosuke in the Kiteretsu Daihyakka anime.]

254
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,400
HIjikata-san...

255
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,040
Mr. Kondo, we shall protect your life.

256
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,860
In return, you have an obligation to fulfill.

257
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,380
To not die.

258
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,670
Do whatever it takes to live.

259
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,980
No matter how humiliating it may be...

260
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,150
No matter how many squad members
die before your eyes, you must live!

261
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,800
As long as you're here,

262
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,610
the Shinsengumi is not finished.

263
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,150
We joined the Shinsengumi because
we wanted to be with you...

264
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,450
You're an idiot.

265
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,580
Don't think about such difficult things!

266
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,600
You should live the way you want to live.

267
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,180
We just have to protect
you from everyone.

268
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,010
Kondo-san...

269
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,830
You are the soul of the Shinsengumi.

270
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,100
We are the sword that protects you.

271
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,240
Toshi...

272
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,610
You broke once before.
What can you protect?

273
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,230
Hijikata-kun, it seems we have
to settle things between us.

274
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,930
I have a sword right here.
One that cuts very well.

275
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,330
Odd Jobs, I heard your rotten sermon!

276
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,580
What is it?

277
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,070
Don't talk as if you're so high and mighty.

278
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,030
Draw it already!

279
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,210
Shut up!

280
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,210
I have one more thing to say to you.

281
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,950
Thank you!!

282
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,440
Hey, hey, it looks like the demonic
sword devoured him again...

283
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,570
Toshi? Is that Toshi?

284
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,510
I'm...

285
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:42,020
Shinsengumi Vice-Chief
Toshiro Hijikata!!

It changed... The rhythm of that
man's soul has changed.

289
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:23,750
It went from a childish anime song
to a sturdy rock-and-roll tune.

290
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,960
I guess the same goes
for you, too, Ito-dono.
