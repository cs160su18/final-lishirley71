00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,150
The first thing to do when you
wake up in the morning

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,590
is to look for toy store ads that come with
the newspaper during the holiday season.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,820
Then you study it while standing next to your old
man when he reads the paper in the morning.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:27,470
You must not make any direct references
such as saying "I want this."

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,180
Show that you're thoughtful enough to refrain from
asking for presents because of money concerns.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,840
A sigh can prove effective.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,590
You old man may pretend
he doesn't notice,

9
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,470
but I guarantee he does.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,280
Be patient and continue this
routine every morning.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,190
And then one morning,
you wake up to find

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,730
that your old man has pulled
out the toy store ad for you.

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,810
This means that victory
is within your grasp.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,340
"Price dropped on the TS."

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,390
Casual little pushes like that.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,590
Be wary of your pronunciation.

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,180
Your old man is unfamiliar
with foreign words.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,210
Enunciate each and every word.

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,590
Then you just wait for
Christmas morning...

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,970
["I put together your favorite ads.
Merry Christmas. - Gin"]

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,970
...Merry Christmas.

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,100
[Merry Christmas!! Never mind that
it's March, Merry Christmas!!]

23
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,090
Hey, where's the usual "This show is
brought to you by" segment?

24
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,060
[Kagura had no luck with Santa last year.
How will her Christmas turn out this year?]

25
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,670
Don't tell me the sponsors
are no longer...

26
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,730
[You know, we ended up with some extra runtime.
Sorry, Gin-san, but can you handle the rest?]

27
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,670
Huh? Hold on a second!!

28
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,730
What sort of stunt are we trying to pull
off here?! Screw you, bastards!!

29
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,870
The hell am I supposed to
do with my voice only?!

30
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,550
[We're not screwing around. (lol)]

31
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,910
[We're not screwing around. (lol)]
[You can do it, Gin-san!! (lol)]

32
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,890
And why is there so much
runtime left here anyway?!

33
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,250
Dear Dad.

34
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,340
How is your hair doing?

35
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,200
I wonder what part of the universe you're
shedding hair right about now?

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,770
I'm on Earth with a full
head of hair as always.

37
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,650
There's an Earth holiday called
Christmas coming up,

38
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,540
and everybody is excited.

39
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,440
Because there's a legend that Santa
Kurosu, a red old geezer,

40
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,440
comes to give presents to the children.

41
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,070
This time of year, everybody

42
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,020
gets excited about what they
should ask Santa for.

43
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,720
But that old Santa fella
has never visited me.

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,610
I asked for a present last year,
but Santa never showed up.

45
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,790
See the beginning of this episode
for further details.

46
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,930
Dad, does old man Santa hate me?

47
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,000
Or does Santa not even exist?

48
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,490
It seems that your daughter's having
a hard time on a distant planet.

49
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:29,670
Kids end up leaving you after twenty years or
so, no matter how much you care for them.

50
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,490
But the memories from
those twenty years

51
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,460
will help support those kids
for the rest of their life.

52
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,710
In other words, childhood memories
can never be replaced.

53
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,880
If there's something you need to do,
go ahead and do it, Umi Bouzu-san.

54
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,100
She won't keep sending
you letters forever.

55
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,670
Old timer, send this to
the branch on Earth.

56
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,230
You aren't going to see your daughter?

57
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,630
War's broken out between planet
Kameda and planet Naito again.

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,870
Planet Kanehira's asked for assistance.

59
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,730
I see.

60
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,990
Guess you don't have a choice.

61
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,770
Since you're even busier
than this Santa fella.

62
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,120
Don't die out there.

63
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,540
What the...?

64
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,290
Dear Kagura-chan.

65
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,840
I read your letter.

66
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,250
I'm glad that you still have
a full head of hair.

67
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,840
Your father also has a full
head of hair, as always.

68
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,720
I would love to go see you
as it's been so long,

69
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,170
but I'm busy with work,
so I can't go to Earth.

70
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,060
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,820
I pray from far away in
space that you have

72
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,090
a merry Christmas with
your Earth friends.

73
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,180
There's no need to be sad.

74
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,460
I won't be able to go see you,

75
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,800
but if you're a good girl, I'm sure
that he'll come visit you.

76
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,970
Thank you very much.

77
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,010
With a large bag full of presents...

78
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,730
Clad in red clothing...

79
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,630
Santa will come...

80
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,850
[Santa Claus Red is Blood Red]

81
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,380
Merry Christmas!

82
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,930
And here's to another year gone by!

83
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,980
Boy, there's a real sense
of refinement about

84
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,970
sitting around a kotatsu with
a hot pot on Christmas.

85
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,000
Right, Sis?

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,890
Sorry if this doesn't feel very Christmasy.

87
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,340
I heard that this would also
be an end-of-the-year party.

88
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,880
No, I'm fine with this.

89
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,610
It's too much effort to hold
a Christmas party

90
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,490
and end-of-year party separately, right?

91
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,550
It's not because we have no
money! It'd just be a drag!

92
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,520
A blend of eastern and
western cultures.

93
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,650
The informal atmosphere
is very Japanese.

94
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,930
You got that right!

95
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,200
And you don't need to worry.

96
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,860
I brought something Christmasy with me.

97
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,300
Here, a special order cake.

98
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,150
Wow! That's amazing, Hasegawa-san!

99
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,120
Though it's kind of small...

100
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,630
But it looks very delicious!

101
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,000
Quality over quantity.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,560
The lovable look is very Japanese.

103
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,910
You got that right!

104
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,040
You'll just feel sick if you eat too much.

105
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,060
This is the perfect size.

106
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,660
Then let's cut it up.

107
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,300
Here, Kagura-chan. You get
the part with chocolate.

108
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,690
Lucky you, Kagura-chan!

109
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,320
Boy, that's no fair!

110
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,550
No fair that Kagura-chan gets everything!

111
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,900
Stop fighting now.

112
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,670
Here, I'll start serving food
so pass me your plates.

113
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,650
Oh, yes!

114
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,690
What would you like, Shin-chan?

115
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,770
Oh, what's in the hot pot?

116
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,770
[Note: Spoof on a brand of
Japanese starch noodles.]

117
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,770
There's Malomy-girl, Malomy-boy,
and Mr. Malomy.

118
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,190
Doesn't that mean there's
only Malomy...?

119
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,050
Then I'll go with Malomy-boy!

120
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,660
After all, I'm a boy!

121
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,490
Come on, you need to interact
with girls for a change.

122
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,920
When are you ever going
find yourself a girlfriend?

123
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,790
You got me there!

124
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,030
Man, wow...

125
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,130
Christmas is so much fun!

126
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,210
It's too bad Gin-san couldn't join us.

127
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,080
Seriously, what's he doing?

128
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,450
He's probably walking around drinking.

129
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,430
Just ignore that scoundrel.

130
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,420
You're right!

131
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,780
Let's have fun talking about
Gin-san behind his back!

132
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,740
It appears that I'm in time
for that Christmas event.

133
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,060
But what a meager party...

134
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,140
Is this truly Christmas?

135
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,300
Kagura-chan is completely bummed out.

136
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,980
Hold on, Kagura-chan.

137
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,730
Daddy's coming.

138
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,870
Daddy will transform this destitute
night into a lovely Christmas Eve.

139
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,420
Kagura will be so surprised when
she sees me here in Edo.

140
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,610
Oh wait, that can't do.

141
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,490
I must play through this Santa
character for tonight.

142
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,870
She's been discouraged by the reality
that Santa does not exist.

143
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,470
A parent has the duty
to help a child dream.

144
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,710
It's sad that I cannot visit her as a parent,

145
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,880
but if it means I can help make
this a fond memory...

146
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,820
Huh?

147
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,690
Is someone in the yard?

148
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,900
Oh? What?

149
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,510
Oh no, is it a thief?

150
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,110
They've noticed!

151
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,360
Here I go!

152
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,870
Merry Christmas!

153
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,540
Have you all been good
little boys and girls?

154
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,620
Santa Claus is here to make you happy!

155
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,470
Kagura-chan's completely surprised.

156
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,540
Yep, Santa Claus really exists.

157
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,890
Your personal Santa is right here...

158
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,710
Huh? She's a little too surprised.

159
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,370
Shouldn't she act a bit more happy?

160
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,420
Huh? What?

161
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,470
Did daddy do something wrong?

162
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,350
Is there hair sticking out my nose?

163
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,390
Huh?

164
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,010
It's... It's Santa!

165
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,920
There are two Santas!

166
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,970
Who are you people?!

167
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,780
What's going on?

168
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,640
Why is there another Santa here?

169
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,090
Who is this guy?

170
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,250
Why is there another Santa
besides Gin-Santa?

171
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:20,060
I've been waiting here the entire evening in
this freezing weather to surprise them...

172
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,190
Why?

173
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,030
Why did this happen?!

174
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,840
The worst possible timing...

175
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,310
What do I do?

176
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,040
She's scared now, not happy.

177
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,230
There could never be two Santas!

178
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,110
One must be fake!

179
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,720
A thief who disguised himself as Santa
to rob the houses of innocent people!

180
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm turning you over to the cops!

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,130
Nononono, you've got it totally wrong!

182
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,830
It's daddy!

183
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,540
Santa-Daddy whose come
to help you dream!

184
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,140
Hey! They're treating me like
a fake because of this guy!

185
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,600
Wait, hold on sec...

186
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,110
On second thought...

187
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,600
[FAKE]

188
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,130
I am a fake.

189
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,980
This is bad...

190
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,890
Maybe I should reveal myself before
they turn me over to the cops...

191
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,980
No, but my goal is to
help Kagura dream...

192
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,960
Hey, why are you standing there?

193
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,150
Say something!

194
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,890
It'd be embarrassing to tell them the truth
after all the trouble I've gone through.

195
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,750
Because I haven't accomplished anything!

196
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,380
Haven't accomplished a single thing!

197
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,060
Uh, excuse me.

198
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,140
Who might you be?

199
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,190
Huh?

200
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,270
I'll force him to back down.

201
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,850
I should be able to maintain
the act once I'm alone.

202
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,460
Well, it's not that I think you're
a thief or anything.

203
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,200
Uh, do you belong to some kind
of volunteer organization?

204
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,450
Er, what?

205
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,370
Who are you?

206
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,650
Do you belong to some neighborhood
children's association?

207
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,340
Not at all. I happen to be, well...

208
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,650
Santa, as you can see.

209
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,020
No, you can stop acting now.

210
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,520
That beard is obviously fake.

211
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,580
Well, I don't particularly care
about you copying me.

212
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,590
But I would prefer you
don't half-ass the job.

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,430
You'll get yourself hurt if you
underestimate Santa.

214
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,370
Please...

215
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,660
That's a harsh joke.

216
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,360
You're the one who's copying me.

217
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,100
Why isn't this guy backing down?

218
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,040
Well, some people don't realize
they're copying others.

219
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,420
Just like how everyone casually uses the manga
system developed by Osamu Tezuka.

220
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,300
This old guy is digging in.

221
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,810
What's with this guy?

222
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,790
Why does he refuse to back down?

223
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,800
He's just a fake.

224
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,670
Say.

225
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,800
Do you listen to rock?

226
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,980
They say that every current rock and
roll band was born from the Beatles.

227
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,070
Meaning, you more or less
spawned from me.

228
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,280
What? You're Santa and you
listen to the Beatles?!

229
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,870
Huh? What? I can't?

230
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,690
What do you listen to then?

231
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,830
Santa's supposed to listen to Enya, man.

232
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,470
That new age stuff.

233
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,250
Could you cut this out, old timer?!

234
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,550
I know you're a fake! So scram!

235
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,310
Oh, yes. Enya, you say.

236
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,030
I've heard that Enya la-la-la...

237
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:05,650
[Note: The late Chosuke Ikariya,
Japanese musician and comedian.]

238
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,820
That's Ikariya, not Enya.

239
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,650
Odd, this man has no shame...

240
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,770
[Note: Singer-songwriter Tatsuro Yamashita.]

241
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,550
Well, there's also the obvious Tatsuro.

242
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,770
He's ancient.

243
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,060
Now, it's about his wife, Mariya.

244
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,920
[Note: Mariya Takeuchi. Song was
used for Holiday commercials.]

245
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,920
Who sings the fried chicken thing.

246
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,170
Tatsuro and Kazumasa are
classics in every era.

247
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,170
[Note: Kazumasa Oda, another
veteran singer-songwriter.]

248
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,170
This old man hasn't flinched at all!

249
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,670
That confidence... Could he be...

250
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,680
Don't tell me this guy is...

251
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,920
The real Santa Claus?!

252
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,450
On closer look, this guy may
have a unkempt appearance,

253
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,870
but he carries himself
with a certain grace.

254
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,110
Like a master of the sword.

255
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,600
He's an old man with a beard of white,
yet he's brimming with vitality.

256
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,560
He has the skin of a man in his twenties.

257
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,260
Is he even human?

258
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,400
I once met a man who
called himself Santa.

259
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,040
He was just an old man with no ambition.

260
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,780
But this guy's completely different.

261
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,410
He doesn't have a white beard,
the symbol of Santa,

262
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,750
but that short mustache,

263
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,220
that short mustache he doesn't even try
to hide, actually looks more realistic.

264
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,300
Maybe Santa's supposed to
just have a short mustache?

265
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,510
Like the letdown when you see
Lord Frieza's final form.

266
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,450
Like how the real deal's are actually
quite simple-looking.

267
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,550
No, but that can't...

268
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,960
For real?

269
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:49,870
This is the worst possible place
to run into the real Santa.

270
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,510
What are they doing?

271
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,550
They've been staring at each other in
silence and haven't budged an inch.

272
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,360
What am I supposed to do?

273
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
Should I apologize?

274
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,440
Is he like, mad?

275
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,500
It's too late to apologize now.

276
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,740
It'd be absolutely disgraceful.

277
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,460
[Note: Performed by the
singer Shinichi Mori.]

278
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,570
This is like a comedian doing a parody
of the song "Ofukuro-san"

279
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,460
when the singer himself
shows up behind you.

280
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,700
I won't have it!

281
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,430
I can't disgrace myself
while they're watching!

282
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,110
Then what am I supposed to do?

283
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,500
What is the fake "Ofukuro-san" supposed
to do, Kings of Comedy?!

284
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,050
As he walks up behind me
and goes, "Nice try, kid,"

285
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,220
how am I supposed to not embarrass
myself, Kings of Comedy?!

286
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,330
Tell me, Kings of Comedy!

287
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,650
Take out Ofukuro-san

288
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,680
and become the real deal!

289
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,790
Wait!

290
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,330
What are you guys doing?!

291
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,320
Aren't you two supposed to be Santa?!

292
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,180
The hell are you doing in
front of the children?!

293
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,350
Santa... You really are good...

294
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,080
I find it hard to believe that you're a slacking
senior who only works on Christmas!

295
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,150
This old man was able
to land a blow on me...

296
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,610
Is this the power of the real Santa?

297
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,080
But it no longer matters
who the real one is!

298
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,620
Santa!

299
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,040
Is!

300
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,980
Me!

301
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,820
Stop!

302
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,750
Enough of this.

303
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,630
It would be rude for one
who claims to be Santa

304
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,120
to shed blood on this holy night.

305
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,070
If you insist on sullying Santa's
name, leave at once.

306
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,270
This turf belongs to me, Kyuta Claus!

307
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,430
We got another Santa here!

308
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,820
But this Santa isn't even
concealing her identity.

309
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,070
It's Kyu-chan. That's Kyu-chan, right?

310
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,240
I am not Kyu-chan.

311
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,870
I am Kyuta Claus.

312
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,990
Beautiful princess, please
accept my present.

313
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,400
A year's supply of your favorite
Baagen-Dash...

314
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,290
What?!

315
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,690
Can't let you have fun without
me, Kyuta Claus!

316
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,980
This is not your turf!

317
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,570
I, Monkey Claus, have
marked this jungle!

318
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,230
I won't allow you to lay a finger on
the female ape who lives here!

319
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,710
Who are you calling a female ape?!

320
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,460
Otae-san!

321
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,750
I am willing to meet you every night,

322
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,250
whether midsummer night or holy night!

323
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,750
If you so desire, I will be the Santa

324
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,140
who brings you happiness
365 days a year!

325
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,870
This won't be a simple holy night!

326
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,080
Yes!

327
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,440
We will be joined together
on this hole-in night!

328
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,690
Um, excuse me.

329
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,200
Is Gin-san here?

330
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,160
I can't seem to find him anywhere.

331
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,610
I want to give him a present.
Where might he have gone?

332
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,700
There's nothing Santa about it anymore!!

333
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,080
One Santa after another!

334
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,000
I can no longer tell who's real or fake!

335
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,680
Actually, over half of them
are just stalkers.

336
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,720
Just a bunch of perverts.

337
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,350
They all insist that they're Santa.

338
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,550
I'm not wearing anything inside,
so it's pretty cold...

339
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,320
Of course.

340
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,390
I am the real Santa.

341
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,340
I have no intention of
relinquishing this title.

342
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,340
I am the Santa who will
make Otae-chan happy.

343
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,770
I mean, Kyuta.

344
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,590
It's me! I'm the Santa who wants
Otae-san to make me happy.

345
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,660
That would make Sis the Santa.

346
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,460
This world only needs one Santa...

347
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,950
I got it!

348
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,710
Then I'll represent the children of this world
and decide who the real Santa is!

349
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,640
A contest to determine
who is Santa Claus!

350
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,470
I don't think anyone of them
are fit to be Santa.

351
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:14,370
The very first very merry contest to determine
who the real Santa Claus is!

352
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,980
Why are you taking the lead
here, Kagura-chan?

353
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,190
Listen up, Santas!

354
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,490
I'm going to give you the Santa test!

355
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,290
If you are able to pass this test
that would be simple for Santa,

356
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,250
I will name you as the real
Santa for proving yourself!

357
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,710
Kagura-chan, what is this Santa test?

358
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,840
That should be obvious.

359
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,370
Santa's purpose is to give
presents to little kids.

360
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,140
To read the wishes of all the children

361
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,970
and grant those wishes
by delivering presents.

362
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,760
Yes, Santa's job is to
help children dream.

363
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,960
When they're lined up here to be
judged by one of those kids,

364
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
there's isn't anything to
dream about, is there?

365
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,850
I'm going to pretend to be a girl

366
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,200
who's going through various different
Christmas situations.

367
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,590
You just have to grant that girl's wishes.

368
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,360
You'll be judged on your performance.

369
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
Wait, hold on!

370
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,350
I didn't come here to give presents
to the china dress girl.

371
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,800
Yes, my apologies to Miss Kagura, but
I only want to be Otae-chan's Santa.

372
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,240
That's right. Don't try to butt-in, little girl.

373
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,770
Now bring out Gin-san.

374
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,890
My present is fresh.

375
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,510
I must deliver it before it rots.

376
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,050
It's already rotten, you Natto Santa!

377
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,360
How can you call yourself Santa when
you refuse to help a child dream?

378
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,400
Listen up.

379
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,100
Don't forget that if the whole Santa helps
children to dream story doesn't fly,

380
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,600
you're a bunch of trespassing
old pedophiles.

381
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,120
That's crazy talk!

382
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,280
Forget about presents! The Feds
are going to come calling!

383
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,520
If you can't prove you're the real Santa,

384
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,400
You'll be led away by the reindeer
(a.k.a. the police)

385
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,360
in a sled (a.k.a. a patrol car).

386
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,120
That's a low blow...

387
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,040
Aren't you the police?

388
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,810
If you don't believe you're up
the task, feel free to leave.

389
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,380
I see no problem with this test.

390
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,380
Because I am...

391
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,280
the real Santa!

392
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,700
The others don't matter.

393
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,360
This guy here is the problem.

394
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,840
I can no longer turn back.

395
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,270
I'll defeat the real Santa...

396
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,650
And I'm...

397
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm...

398
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,920
gonna be king of the Santas!

399
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,820

Wait!

Gonna be king of the Santas? It's March!

403
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,580
We're still doing these
Christmas episodes?

404
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,050
Don't be so anal.

405
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,710
Keep talking like that and Santa
won't visit your home this year.

406
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,310
Really?

407
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,680
And so, the next episode...

408
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,650
