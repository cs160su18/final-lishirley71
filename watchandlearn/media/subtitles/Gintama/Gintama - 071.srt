00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,540
[No. To-502, who embodies Dr. Hayashi's character data, started a coup d'etat in Edo.]

3
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,080
[Gintoki and friends headed deep under the robot-conquered Terminal to return a smile to Fuyo's face.]

4
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,120
["Some Data Cannot Be Erased"]

5
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,350
In a city wrapped in darkness,

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,700
you can see a mass of bodies glowing eerily in the darkness.

7
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,960
It is a coup d'etat. A coup d'etat by the robots against humanity!

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,840
At present, patrol officers from the Magistrate's Office are headed this way to quell the coup.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,030
With the Terminal occupied by the robots,

10
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,440
the city is paralyzed, making this a tough battle!

11
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,570
Right now, I do not know if video of this report is being broadcasted.

12
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,720
What will become of Edo? And will my salary be paid?!

13
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,870
Isn't this a much better shortcut than up on the ground level where it's crawling with robots?

14
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,600
Security is lax, it seems...

15
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,270
Old man!

16
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,240
What shortcut?! What's that huge thing?!

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,840
That is No. 307, a.k.a. Udo-chan. Her specialty is cleaning tall buildings.

18
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,310
She is a destructive type recalled for breaking the neck of the Great Buddha at Kamakura.

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,480
Old man! Do something!

20
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,980
Tama!

21
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,940
Affirmative. Inserting disc.

22
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,400
Y-You!

23
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,340
Sounds like Rocky.

24
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,280
She's playing a Rocky-ish theme.

25
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,180
It's similar, but...

26
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,090
It's the stuff adults worry about, you know,

27
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,040
like getting into trouble if you use the real theme.

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,390
But why Rocky?!

29
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,250
Just hearing it motivates you.

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,450
She's nothing more than a CD player!

31
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:32,510
[Note: Gibberish that sounds like the "Gonna Fly Now" song from the Rocky movie.]

32
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:32,510
Fenis monjaa, fenis monjaa!

33
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,530
And now you're singing?! She doesn't know the words! What's a "Fenis"?

34
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,560
It just makes me angry and doesn't heighten my will to fight at all!

35
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,790
Adrian!

36
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,670
We're falling! Hang on!

37
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,660
Tsk. Pochi!

38
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,950
Ol... Old man!

39
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:06,460
Gin-no-ji, save the robots and Ryuzan. They're crying.

40
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,840
Old man!

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,910
Old man!

42
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,710
As I continued my research, I realized...

43
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,500
bringing my daughter back to life was impossible.

44
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,550
And even No. To-502, which holds Dr. Hayashi's character data

45
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,020
and which we thought was the closest to being perfect, developed a bug.

46
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,040
It may sound strange for me to say this,

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,090
but it seems my character was destroyed by a robot infection.

48
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,570
But one possibility emerged from my research.

49
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,050
The first daughter of the Fuyo Project, and the basis for all the Fuyo models,

50
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,310
was No. i-Zero.

51
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,020
Compared to the models that followed, it was far inferior in its capabilities,

52
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,850
and no one expected "The Seed" to germinate within her. However...

53
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,410
Ka...

54
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,650
Kagura! Sadaharu!

55
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,740
Gin-chan. We'll join you later. Wait for us, okay?

56
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,440
You foo--

57
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,550
It's too dangerous!

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,540
It's useless to try to save them. Their chances of survival are...

59
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,530
Let go of me! I don't have time to listen to your stupid calculations!

60
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,130
I'm saying it's useless.

61
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,630
And I said to shut up!

62
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,860
Because they're alive.

63
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,090
I'm saying they're still alive.

64
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,420
Certainly, via any normal calculation,

65
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,070
their chances of survival are less than 0.1 percent.

66
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,040
However, they are all still alive.

67
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,940
I hope they're alive.

68
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,130
I'm sorry. I know I'm saying such strange things. It would seem I have a bug.

69
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,360
It's not a bug.

70
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,440
What?

71
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,960
You know what I mean.

72
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,330
Emotions are beginning to develop in No. i-Zero.

73
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,930
Without a doubt, human emotions.

74
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,120
By storing Fuyo's soul for such a long time within its body,

75
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,840
changes have begun to occur in No. i-Zero's programming.

76
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,580
We could say she's Fuyo's child... No, the reincarnation of Fuyo.

77
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,610
She's coming back.

78
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,590
Coming back to me, at last.

79
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,650
I'll never let you go again. I won't let you feel lonely.

80
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,830
Soon, the world will be filled with only the friends you loved.

81
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,830
For your sake, I will change this country...

82
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,180
No, you won't.

83
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,660
You're not doing this for your daughter.

84
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,940
You're trying to bring her back to life and creating such a huge disturbance all for your own sake.

85
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,680
The lonely one was you, Ryuzan.

86
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,180
Gin-san!

87
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,260
Fuyo.

88
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,530
I waited so long for you. Now come to me.

89
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,790
What's the matter? Can't you obey my order,

90
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,260
No. i-Zero?

91
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,160
Unfortunately, I do not recognize you as the doctor.

92
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,900
Wh-What?

93
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,070
"Make my daughter smile..."

94
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,130
In compliance with Dr. Hayashi's orders,

95
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,230
No. To-502, I will...

96
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,550
destroy you!

97
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,420
Fuyo...

98
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:56,350
I want to become a robot, as well. Then I will be released from this suffering and sadness.

99
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,090
I understand now... Why the doctor said those things...

100
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,490
He came to a realization.

101
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,570
The reason he wanted to give eternal life to frail Fuyo-sama,

102
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,170
and the reason why he tried to bring Fuyo-sama back from the dead,

103
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,280
wasn't for Fuyo-sama's sake. It was for his own.

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,650
It was the doctor who was lonely.

105
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,050
It was you!

106
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,740
He didn't want to lose Fuyo-sama.

107
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,320
The emotions that stemmed from his worry brought about his daughter's death.

108
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,300
Hey, what're you doing? C'mon.

109
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,530
He had killed his own daughter. He was tormented by feelings of guilt.

110
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,430
And yet he still wanted his daughter and struggled to bring her back.

111
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,310
He came to that realization.

112
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,130
This is no time to be having a conversation!

113
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,710
He became a robot to get rid of those emotions and escape from the torment.

114
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,450
But you are still tormented and suffering.

115
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,700
...Clutching to the remnants of your dream.

116
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,460
You are pitiful.

117
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,430
I will put an end to it all. That is my duty.

118
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,950
I was built to put a smile on the faces of Fuyo-sama and the doctor.

119
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,700
It is my duty!

120
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,910
Wonderful.

121
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,020
It would have been unthinkable in your former state to disobey me.

122
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,520
Unlike me, whose character and memories are being destroyed,

123
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,690
new emotions are blossoming inside you as you become more human.

124
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,970
That is wonderful.

125
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,200
You're even going through a rebellious stage.

126
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,610
But you've gone a bit too far.

127
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,870
Tama-san!

128
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,410
Hey Father, she's not in a rebellious phase. She's trying to leave the nest.

129
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,280
Don't think...

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,100
you can always...take a bath...together!

131
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,480
Too bad.

132
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,170
My central processor is not inside my head.

133
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,330
Gin-san!

134
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,570
Don't think of me like the other robots.

135
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,490
As long as the central processor deep within my body remains safe,

136
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,680
I can repair myself no matter how severe the damage.

137
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,910
And I have more unfortunate news for you.

138
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,920
My processor is tinier than a single micron.

139
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,530
Finding it inside my body and destroying it is like looking for a single grain of sand in a desert.

140
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,200
One micron. What a puny soul.

141
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,980
Gin-san!

142
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,940
Tama-san!

143
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Even if she's in a rebellious stage, a child always returns to her parent in the end.

144
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,980
It appears that your contact had a great deal to do with how much emotion No. i-Zero acquired, but...

145
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,020
it is inconceivable that she would go against her reason for existing-serving me.

146
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,470
It's a temporary bug.

147
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,150
An adjustment will quickly have her back with me.

148
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,020
Fuyo, finish him off with your own hands.

149
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,120
Affirmative.

150
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,110
Sh-Shinpachi.

151
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,180
Shinpachi!

152
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,220
You're next.

153
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,330
Any last words?

154
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,400
You'd make your own daughter kill someone?

155
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,560
A daughter who does anything you say.

156
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,850
So that's what you wanted in the end, Father?

157
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,120
A daughter who would never let you be alone, who never dies,

158
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,120
who would always stay with you. You don't want a daughter.

159
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,750
You want a maid to do your bidding!

160
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,940
If you're so desperate for a woman who does your every bidding, you can have her.

161
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,220
However...

162
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,760
She's rugged-looking.

163
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,670
Master!

164
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,130
Those aren't any of my robots!

165
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,470
Guys!

166
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,970
I'll show you a man's machine! Fire!

167
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,380
Fuyo?!

168
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,480
Why?! Why are you?!

169
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,980
Let go! Let go of me!

170
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,400
I am afraid I cannot comply.

171
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,850
You are not my master.

172
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,290
They are.

173
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,360
Were you just pretending to obey me?

174
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,460
That can't be! You feel that much for them?!

175
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,440
If I survive but couldn't protect what was important to me

176
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,150
I might as well be dead.

177
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,170
Once I decide to protect something, I protect it to the very end.

178
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,340
Doctor, is that in your data? This way of life?

179
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,020
What're you...?

180
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,620
I told you-it's useless.

181
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,220
Unless you destroy the microprocessor, I will keep...coming back.

182
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,870
If I stuff you inside this energy beam that concentrates all the energy of Edo,

183
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,400
your puny soul should be destroyed.

184
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,390
Wh-What're you...

185
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Go fool around with your maids in hell,

186
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
you...

187
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,880
sick old man!

188
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,930
Gin-san!

189
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,930
Gin-chan!

190
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,540
M-My body...is...disintegrating!

191
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,950
My soul...disappearing.

192
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,720
Stop it.

193
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,190
Please stop.

194
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,180
Don't...don't...

195
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,680
leave me all alone...

196
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,980
Fu...Fuyo!

197
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,330
Fu...Fuyo...

198
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,560
Good-bye.

199
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,380
Good-bye, Father...

200
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,240
Ryuzan... You damn fool.

201
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,820
Did I do the right thing?

202
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,800
I did it to make Fuyo-sama and the doctor smile, but...

203
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,470
The Fuyo-sama inside of me...

204
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,080
won't smile. She won't stop crying.

205
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,260
I am unstable and my thought circuitry is not working properly.

206
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,910
I want to run away. Is this how it feels to suffer?

207
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,910
What should I do?

208
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,420
How can I restore myself from the effects of this bug?

209
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,290
It's not a bug.

210
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,080
It's proof that you are functioning normally.

211
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,170
That's why there's no need to run away or be afraid.

212
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,850
A pregnant woman gives birth to her kid by suffering

213
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,630
through what feels like squeezing a watermelon through her nostrils.

214
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,090
Artists endure suffering that feels like pulling the entire universe

215
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,500
out of their ass to create their works.

216
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,400
Everyone has times when they've come up against a wall

217
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,990
and feel like giving up on everything and running away.

218
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,980
But you mustn't forget that during these times when the going is rough,

219
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,790
the soul inside of you will try to create something to break through that wall.

220
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,770
And don't forget that in your suffering there is something very precious.

221
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,900
We're all suffering in agony with our own troublesome lives.

222
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,770
Sometimes it comes to tears.

223
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,660
When that happens, let it flow as much as it wants.

224
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,400
If it still doesn't stop flowing, then we'll come and mop it up.

225
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,060
Thank...you...

226
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,460
Thank...you.

227
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,150
Thank you, everyone.

228
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,640
I think we were a bit too rough.

229
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,070
The controlled energy is about to explode.

230
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,640
Explode?!

231
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,370
This is under the Terminal, where all of Edo's power is concentrated!

232
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,780
If an explosion occurs here...

233
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,750
Edo will be blasted to smithereens!

234
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,720
You guys get out of here as fast as you can!

235
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,820
Gengai-san!

236
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,420
A mechanic caused this situation.

237
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,320
A mechanic has to find a way to stop it.

238
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,840
That's rash! It's too dangerous near the control panel! You can't get near it!

239
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,070
Tama!

240
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,070
Tama-san!

241
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,900
The doctor caused this situation.

242
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,570
A maid will have to clean it up.

243
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,470
Gengai-sama, use that to communicate.

244
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,850
Please provide instructions.

245
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,790
Wait a minute!

246
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,780
Tama-san!

247
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,580
Gin-chan!

248
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,580
Gin-san!

249
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,960
No! Gin-chan, let me go!

250
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,630
Tama!

251
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,030
Tama-san!

252
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,700
If I survive but couldn't protect what was important to me, I might as well be dead.

253
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,340
That probably meant the death of one's will;

254
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,410
the death of one's soul.

255
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,280
I thought there was no way a robot like myself could understand,

256
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,010
but I feel I understand it a bit now.

257
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,340
I, too, have something I want to protect.

258
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,250
No matter how many times you flip the off switch or trip the circuit breaker...

259
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,620
or if I should be destroyed, I won't forget.

260
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,140
So...

261
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,830
So please everyone, please don't forget me.

262
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,600
That way, my soul...

263
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,390
will live on inside all of you.

264
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,310
Tama!

265
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,910
Fa...ther...I...

266
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,090
made...friends.

267
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,350
Not robots, but true friends...

268
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,600
The robots have stopped moving?!

269
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,180
The lights have turned back on in the city!

270
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,390
Did you see that?

271
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,080
The robots suddenly stopped moving. What could have happened?

272
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm currently reporting live, but I have no idea when this will be broadcast--

273
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,150
Huh? I'm on. I'm on the air?

274
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,220
We did it! It appears the city is functioning again!

275
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,360
Hey, it went off again. What's with this pile of junk?

276
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,880
Are we having another robot coup d'etat?

277
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,900
That TV hasn't been working right ever since I removed Tama's central processor.

278
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,710
Tama? What's that? Whose cat is that?

279
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,800
You've forgotten already? That's good.

280
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,660
I thought for sure you'd be depressed.

281
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,650
The kiddies are. I'm afraid I can't let such things bother me.

282
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,960
Even if bad things happen, I know how to lie to myself,

283
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,020
or let off the steam in a good way.

284
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,530
Oops, I'm becoming more cunning the older I get. That's not good. Right, old man?

285
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,370
That's important.

286
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,750
There are things in this world that we can't do anything about.

287
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,270
Fighting is not the only way.

288
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,900
It's wiser to drink and forget about it.

289
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,180
So true.

290
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,640
By the way, Gin-no-ji.

291
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,920
Huh?

292
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,050
What is that?

293
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,940
Something I picked up.

294
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,520
During that incident?

295
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,200
I thought I could sell it for a high price, but unfortunately, the head's empty.

296
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,750
I can't sell it like that.

297
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,670
Then...

298
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,100
throw it away. It's just junk.

299
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,240
Quiet.

300
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't know if it's combustible or non-combustible trash.

301
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,650
By the way, old man...

302
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,750
Huh?

303
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,170
What're those things?

304
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:33,070
During the incident, my robots picked those up. They're getting in my way.

305
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,280
Then throw them out. They're just junk.

306
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,720
Quiet. I don't know what days the trash goes out.

307
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Gin-no-ji, did you know?

308
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,830
After that incident, Ryuzan's robots were destroyed,

309
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,700
but the broken robots found their way by the truckload to shady dealers.

310
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,160
I hear they're being sold on the black market.

311
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,160
If you sell that as-is, the police will know about it immediately.

312
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,140
Make sure you take out what's inside the head.

313
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,390
There might be something...

314
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,210
Forget it. I thought there might be something of value.

315
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,880
If you start getting involved with black market dealers, no amount of lives will be enough...

316
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,190
Hey, what's that?

317
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,070
We picked them up.

318
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,800
That's great, Otose-san. You've got a young girl now.

319
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,840
From way back, I've always thought this place lacked a bit of sex appeal.

320
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,130
What?! Are you saying we're not enough to satisfy your desires?

321
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,270
No, no, you're both sexy, but you need some youth.

322
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,380
What?! I dare you to say that again!

323
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,270
What's so great about a girl who's just a head?!

324
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,540
You can't do anything sexy with her!

325
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,960
She has a mouth.

326
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,380
Otose-san, what're they all doing?

327
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,890
Giving her knowledge.

328
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,590
I don't know what happened before she came here, but she was really beaten up.

329
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,470
When she came here, her memory and data were all wiped out.

330
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,500
She was like a newborn baby.

331
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,910
That's why when you teach her something, she absorbs it like a sponge.

332
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,110
They all get a kick out of that.

333
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,880
Hey you! Stop teaching her nasty things!

334
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,910
I see. She doesn't remember a thing. Poor thing.

335
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,300
Okay, I'm next.

336
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,790
There was one thing she still remembered... What was it, now?

337
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,290
My name's Kotaro Katsura. I'm a revolutionist.

338
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,780
A revolutionist?

339
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,500
Never heard of it? I'm a samurai. You don't know that, either?

340
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,900
Samurai...

341
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,810
Samurai, I know.

342
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,950
Oh?!

343
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,100
They rank above the brave warrior and the evil king.

344
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,270
They are one of the four kings.

345
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,040
No, that's not right. What's that?

346
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,690
My precious friends.

347
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,080
The next episode... "Drive With A "Might" Attitude."

348
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,750
[Katsura and Gin-san go to driving school. Captain Katsura returns!!]

349
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:40,020
[The other episode is about Sadaharu in love? "A Dog's Paws Smell Fragrant."]
