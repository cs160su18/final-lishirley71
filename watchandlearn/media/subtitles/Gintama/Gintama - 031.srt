Keep the room well-lit and watch from a distance, okay?

3
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,340
On his way back from buying JUMP, Gin-san gets into an accident on his moped!!]

4
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,080
[(Administrative message) There have been many careless accidents lately. So let's all be on the alert.]

5
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,650
Man, I vowed I would move on from JUMP already...

6
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,690
So why am I doing this?

7
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,640
Weekly serials are all about the attraction. Once they suck you in, you have to know what happens next week.

8
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,420
You lose track if you miss a single issue, and...

9
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,920
No, that's exactly why I should stop...

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,420
This is really a sin... Shonen Jum... Huh?

11
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,350
Huh? What's this? The sky is all red.

12
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,750
Huh? It's me that's all red.

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,090
Huh? How the hell did this happen?

14
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,820
Huh? Wait a minute, I...

15
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,350
Guys!

16
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,310
Shinpachi...

17
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,810
Gin-san? Is Gin-san all right?

18
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,300
Don't shout in a hospital, idiot!

19
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,920
Same for you, granny!

20
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,420
You, too, brat. And me, too!

21
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,920
Hmph... Nothing to worry about.

22
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,920
He's not the type to die from getting hit by a car.

23
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,910
They say he got hit when he went out to buy JUMP.

24
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,660
That's what happens when you read this kind of junk at his age.

25
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,570
Let's hope he'll take this opportunity to grow up a bit.

26
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,680
You said it.

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,170
You know...

28
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,710
Hearing you say that makes me feel better.

29
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,670
I'm really sorry.

30
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,060
I was talking on my cell phone and didn't see him in time.

31
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,610
So you're the bastard!

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,820
Let's see how far you can fly!! I'm sending you to the moon!

33
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,210
If Gin-chan dies, I'll strangle you to death with your own cell phone strap!

34
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,480
Maybe he's not okay, after all...

35
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,360
Keep it quiet! Where do you idiots think you are?!

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,840
Look who's talking.

37
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,190
Hey! You can't go in there yet!

38
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,670
Hey, he looks fine.

39
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,440
You scared the hell out of us! I won't let you buy JUMP anymore!

40
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,070
We were worried, Gin-san... You sure hit some bad luck, huh?

41
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,240
Who are you?

42
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,190
Do I know you people?

43
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,610
Do we know each other?

44
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:04,460
["You Always Remember the Things that Matter the Least"]

45
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,160
Amnesia?!

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,240
His injuries aren't that bad.

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,200
He hit his head real hard, and that must have made some of his memories pop out.

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,940
"Pop out"?! What is he, a toaster?!

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,800
It's common for someone to lose their memory of what happened before and after an accident.

50
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,640
In his case, he seems to have also forgotten his entire identity.

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,890
That could be quite a problem.

52
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,520
You'd better not be faking this.

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,590
This fool doesn't have amnesia.  He just wants to get out of paying rent.

54
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,230
Doctor... I think I'm hallucinating, too. I keep seeing this hideous goblin.

55
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,300
Sakata-san, there's nothing to worry about.

56
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,720
There are no goblins in this hospital. Maybe a ghost or two...

57
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,970
Doctor, that's not right.

58
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,470
The human memory is very complex, like a tree with its branches intertwined.

59
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,780
If one branch is disturbed, the others move, too.

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,510
Let's just see how it goes for a while.

61
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,240
Odd Jobs Gin... Is this where I live?

62
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,850
That's right, Gin-san. You take on odd jobs... A freelancer.

63
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,000
Odd Jobs... It's no use, I don't remember.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,970
An Odd Jobs who did practically nothing at all. We were like paupers.

65
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,290
Pau...?!

66
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,070
Paupers at my age?!

67
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:34,080
To make matters worse, you always look like a walking corpse with dead fish eyes.

68
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,010
And you didn't pay the rent.

69
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,850
And you also stole Otose-san's money.

70
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,470
That was you!

71
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,350
You might remember something if you go inside.

72
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,990
This is your home, Gin-san. Doesn't it bring back memories?

73
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,070
That's right! You always sat on this sofa, digging your boogers!

74
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,520
Look, Gin-chan!

75
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,650
It's Sadaharu. See?

76
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,080
Humongous! What'd you feed him to make him this big?

77
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,450
Gin-chan, you were always fond of Sadaharu.

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,190
How could I be fond of a ridiculously sized dog like this?

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,130
It's pitch black. I can't see a thing.

80
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,230
Could my mind be unconsciously trying to seal away my memories?

81
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,580
No, that's not it. You've been bitten, that's quite normal really.

82
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,960
My...

83
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,960
consciousness is fading away...

84
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,570
Kagura-chan! He's bleeding!

85
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,980
He'll lose his consciousness as well as his memory!

86
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,430
Do something quickly!

87
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,570
Look, it's your favorite: Ms. Ketsuno.

88
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,160
You'd always peer at her from a low angle during her morning forecast!

89
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,020
Ketsuno, Ana?

90
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,660
Well? Do you remember anything?

91
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,580
I don't remember...or rather, I don't want to remember...

92
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,860
Pull yourself together!

93
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,820
Be a loser! Discard your conscience. That's who GINTOKI is!

94
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,620
Is that so?

95
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,640
That's who GINTOKI is!  He's a sore, sore, sore, loser!!

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,870
Otose-san, what should we do?

97
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,470
Walk him down the streets of Edo.

98
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,560
This is a man with connections throughout Edo.

99
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,460
You might stumble across something that might strike a chord in his memory.

100
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,220
What? Amnesia?

101
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,250
Is this true? Tell me the details of what happened, Gintoki.

102
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,010
As I said, he lost his memories.

103
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,440
By the way, what're you doing here, Katsura-san?

104
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,380
To save the country, first you've got to have money.

105
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,780
Hey, bro! Come on in! We got hot chicks here.

106
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,190
I know, Gintoki, why don't you stop by, too. We have lots of pretties.

107
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,180
[All you can drink! All you can grope!]

108
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,530
You'll be able to forget all the bad memories.

109
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,240
Hasn't he forgotten enough already?!

110
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,990
Are you really friends?!

111
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,390
I feel a memory stirring!

112
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,470
Let's check it out.

113
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,200
Liar!!

114
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,440
I felt something just now! It's coming...!

115
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,720
Really? Remember, Gintoki!

116
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,150
Remember the days when you slaved as my apprentice!

117
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,810
Hey! Don't go changing his memory!

118
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,530
Where is it? Where do I hit to jog your memory? Here? Here?

119
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,690
No, it's probably around here.

120
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,180
No? Then here?

121
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,360
Oh no, no... Stop it!

122
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,590
[Shinsengumi]

123
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,750
What's going on? Is it a fight? It's been a while. Think we should jump in?

124
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,470
Hey, that's...

125
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,820
Katsura!

126
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,100
Did you get him?

127
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,180
Is this ours?

128
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,530
Sogo, run.

129
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,140
Hmph. Stupid samurai should stay home and play with their swords.

130
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,150
No!

131
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,890
You're playing with us today, Katsura!

132
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,370
Hmph, not bad. Run, Elizabeth.

133
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,780
Come back here!

134
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,190
Gin-chan!

135
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,450
Gin-san!

136
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,750
Gin-san! Are you okay, Gin-san?!

137
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,870
Who are you people?

138
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,440
What? Amnesia?!

139
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,650
What is that? A new kind of play?

140
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:37,020
No, never mind. If they can hear each other, they can converse...

141
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,560
This is Candid Camera, isn't it?

142
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,310
I can tell you're all trying to deceive me to get your kicks.

143
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,500
By the way, where's the camera?

144
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,220
You've got it all wrong. He actually has amnesia.

145
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,170
You're lying. That means...

146
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,500
Yes...

147
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,970
He's completely forgotten all the embarrassing things he did

148
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,310
with me and all those painful experiences that came with it?

149
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,150
Um, what is your relationship to me?

150
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,950
How cruel! We were on the brink of being married!

151
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,850
You even wore formal wedding wear!

152
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,540
Well, yes, but...

153
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,520
You only say the facts that are convenient to you.

154
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,890
Those are the tricks of an evil con artist.

155
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,370
Then are you my...

156
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,110
That's right, Gin-san!

157
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,640
I am your love S-L-A-V-E!

158
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,770
Why're you doing this to me?

159
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,810
Is this a kind of abandonment role-play fantasy?

160
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,610
That turns me on, too, but that's not the normal you, Gin-san!

161
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,940
We've been trying to tell you Gin-chan isn't his normal self.

162
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,320
Who is this person?

163
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,860
At this rate, you'll catch her abnormality. Let's go, Gin-san.

164
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,820
I won't let you...

165
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,180
I won't let anyone else have Gin-san!

166
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,120
Phew! What is this stench?!

167
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,200
There was natto in that smoke bomb!

168
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,240
Gin-chan's gone!

169
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,160
Uh, why're you doing this?

170
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,680
It's all right, Gin-san. Leave everything to me. I won't hurt you.

171
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,310
No, grandma always said, you can't trust the people who say they won't hurt you.

172
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,100
Ouch.

173
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,930
There!

174
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,460
You're not getting away!

175
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,910
Too easy. You can't get me with that kind of attack.

176
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,020
Don't worry. I'll teach you everything about me.

177
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,520
I just want to know about my own memory.

178
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,480
Gin-san, knowing about me means knowing about yourself.

179
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,400
Let's rent a small studio apartment.

180
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,090
That'll be the first step of our new beginning.

181
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,370
As for kids, one boy and one girl would be nice, too.

182
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,330
We'll think of wonderful names for them. Sarutobi...

183
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,270
Stop deciding things on your own!

184
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,020
I don't want to take my first steps with you!

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,200
Those words squeeze my heart as strong as they did before!

186
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,280
I won't let you have Gin-chan!

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,050
You think...

188
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,940
You can stop me with that?

189
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,890
Huh...

190
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,110
Where'd Gin-san go...?

191
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,330
Gin-chan!

192
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,320
Gin-san!

193
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,880
I can make it in time! I'll break his fall!

194
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,440
Why'd you take a full swing?!
I don't understand!

195
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,550
Doing it half-heartedly isn't like Gin Tama.

196
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,980
That's no reason to "wham" him!

197
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,340
Gin-san! Gin-san!

198
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,520
Gin-chan, are you alive?

199
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,350
Hey, are you okay?

200
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,240
What is this place?

201
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,380
My, that's awful.

202
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,970
Has he forgotten about me, too?

203
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,140
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,000
You still remember me, right?

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,520
No, he said, "I'm sorry."

206
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,400
No, he remembers. Don't play dumb with me.

207
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,000
You mean I remember him, but he doesn't remember me? That sucks!

208
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
Who does he think he is?

209
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,650
Shin-chan, hit me with this so I forget my memories of Gin-san.

210
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,580
Sis, what am I, a brain surgeon?!

211
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,810
Then I have no choice.

212
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,120
I'll make you remember me, no matter what!

213
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,480
If I duplicate the shock, I'm sure he'll remember!

214
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,990
Sis, not that! You'll put us back where we started!

215
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,980
I'm sorry. I still cannot remember you, but I know I will soon.

216
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,000
Please just be patient.

217
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,230
What...?

218
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,470
Oh my, why is my heart pounding over someone like Gin-san?

219
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,220
His eyes and eyebrows just look closer together...that's all.

220
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,830
And his pupils are bigger...that's all.

221
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,110
Sis?

222
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,460
Forget the past.

223
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,530
Live looking forward rather than backwards.

224
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,860
What?! You changed your mind! Why?!

225
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,100
Lock up that worthless old Gin-san and live your life as the new Gin-san.

226
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,150
Big Sis! That's like putting a cover on smelly things to hide them!

227
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,600
Did I say smelly?

228
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,410
What do I see in a man with dead-fish eyes, anyways?

229
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,540
I prefer Gin-san the way he is now, compared to that frivolous Gin-san.

230
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,080
He's almost... Handsome...

231
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,000
Why are your cheeks so red? You're blushing!

232
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,480
You're not in love with him, are you?!

233
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,090
No way! I won't allow it!

234
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,980
I absolutely refuse to become this creep's brother-in-law!

235
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,120
This isn't about you.

236
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,530
She's right! His eyes and eyebrows may be closer together now,

237
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,360
but when his memory returns, they'll separate again!

238
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,540
He'll be back to that loose face!

239
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,850
What're you doing here?

240
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,700
Well, it was just so toasty and warm... I fell asleep...

241
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,740
Here...

242
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,220
I bought some Bäagen-Dazs for everyone.

243
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,250
It's melted and gooey! How long have you been under there?!

244
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,130
So, we meet again.

245
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,040
I haven't seen you in a while. You've changed quite a bit.

246
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,130
Are you trying to use amnesia to change your image and seduce Otae-san?

247
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,900
I won't let you.

248
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,790
My eyes and eyebrows are way closer together than yours!

249
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,570
Look at me, Otae-san.

250
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,540
You can search all of Edo, but you will never find eyes and brows closer together than these!

251
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,900
I couldn't love a stalker even if he had hair growing out of his eyes!

252
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,620
All right. So what if I grow hair below my eyes? How about that?

253
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:16,780
Wh-What is this? How odd...I feel like as this cup is drawing me towards it.

254
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,830
How about it? You'd be a monster!

255
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,330
Oh! Sugar!

256
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,520
That's right! Sugar might jog his memory!

257
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,890
Eat it!

258
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,530
Sis! Gather every dessert in the house!

259
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,170
Huh? What?

260
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,450
Just get something sweet!

261
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,270
But I don't...

262
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,780
Gin-chan come back to us! Gin-chan!

263
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,510
I...I...I...

264
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,020
I'm...

265
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,990
Gin-chan!

266
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,320
Gin-sa...

267
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,390
Big Sis, what is that?

268
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,660
A tamagoyaki omelet. I made it extra sweet today.

269
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,910
This omelet has quite a unique taste...

270
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,540
Kondo-san!

271
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,750
Gin-san!

272
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,910
Who...are...you...people?

273
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,880
My, how cute...

274
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm sorry. You've tried everything, for me, but in the end, I can't remember anything.

275
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,500
Stop it! It's not like you!

276
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,150
Even if you're 90% wrong, you'll use everything you have of that last 10% to not apologize!

277
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,020
Take your time to remember. We'll wait.

278
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,950
Let's go home and take it easy.

279
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,350
Yes, you might remember something if you just relax at home.

280
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,400
What's that?!

281
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,700
That's...

282
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,010
A spaceship?!

283
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,200
Oh no! It's coming straight at us!

284
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,740
Gin-chan! Gin-chan, it's time for you to do your thing!

285
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,760
What?

286
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,790
Gin-san, quickly!

287
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,250
Uh, um...

288
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,930
Now, Gin-chan.

289
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,460
Um, excuse me, just what am I supposed to do?

290
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,690
Chi! Use your chi! You always do something with your chi!

291
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,110
That's right.

292
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,980
Whether it's a giant robot or a weapon of mass destruction,

293
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,040
you've always slashed your way through with just this sword!

294
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,380
With this...?

295
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,310
You can definitely do it, Gin-chan!

296
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,810
Please do it! Gin-san!

297
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,460
I...

298
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,510
Gin-chan!

299
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,620
Gin-san!

300
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,090
Me?!

301
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,220
Gin-chan...

302
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,800
There's no way...

303
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,050
No human being can accomplish such a thing.

304
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,940
Huh? Isn't that in the direction of Odd Jobs?

305
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,150
That was intense.

306
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,400
It's totaled. They'll have to rebuild.

307
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,310
Our house...

308
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,210
Sorry about that!

309
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,130
I was trying to get to a friend's place, but I got lost.

310
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,990
I ran out of fuel as I was circling about, and crashed here.

311
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,650
Is there an Odd Jobs Kin-chan around here?

312
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,310
If it's Odd Jobs Gin you're looking for, it's the place you destroyed.

313
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,790
No, no, it's Kin-chan.

314
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,030
Weren't you listening? You're not paying attention.

315
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,090
Yeah, yeah, we heard you. Come with us to the station.

316
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,610
Oh, you'll show me to Kintoki's place?

317
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,300
People in Edo are so nice. Thanks.

318
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,400
You're obnoxious. Keep quiet.

319
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Now what are we gonna do?  We've even lost the house.

320
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,390
Who am I...?

321
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,480
Gin-chan!

322
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,010
We'll be all right. We'll manage somehow.

323
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,160
That's right. When your memory returns, I'm sure we'll joke about this.

324
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,540
For the time being, we have to find somewhere else to stay.

325
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,260
Why are these two people...

326
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,190
You've done enough. Don't worry about me.

327
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,060
You both have homes to go back to, don't you?

328
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,790
Don't worry about me. Be free.

329
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,800
Gin-san?

330
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,240
From what I've heard, I made you both work without any real salary.

331
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,610
After this, there's no reason for you to stick around.

332
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,580
Now that I've lost my memory and my house... All the evidence I ever existed is gone.

333
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,040
But this might be a good opportunity.

334
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,590
According to everyone's stories, I was a real mess of a guy.

335
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,610
This is my chance to start all over again.

336
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,440
So let's end this "Odd Jobs" business.

337
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,500
You're kidding, right, Gin-san?

338
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,570
I don't need a salary!

339
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,180
All I need is a little pickled seaweed! So please, Gin-chan!

340
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,590
I'm sorry. The Gin-san you both knew isn't here anymore.

341
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,320
It won't work! You can't function in society! You're an idiot!

342
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,100
Gin-san! Please wait!

343
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,790
Gin-chan!

344
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,930
Gin-saaan!

345
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:22,140
[Preview]

346
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,870
Thank you, everyone watching us on TV, for your support.

347
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,230
It looks like Odd Jobs really is going to close down.

348
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,260
Gin-san went off somewhere, but we'll wait forever.

349
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,950
The next episode: "Life Moves on Like a Conveyor Belt."

350
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,380
[Gintoki, Shinpachi and Kagura go their separate ways.]

351
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,080
[Farewell, Odd Jobs. Farewell, Gin Tama.]

352
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,260
I've decided to relive my life.
