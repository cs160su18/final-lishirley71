What the hell?!

166
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,110
I never heard about that!

167
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,480
That's because you can't be bothered to get moving.

168
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,470
At this rate, the Shinsengumi are really going to be the stars of this anime.

169
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,580
Really?!

170
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,400
Oh!

171
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,230
Now that you mention it, we didn't play the Gin Tama theme music!

172
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,160
This is bad. This is Gin Tama! I'm the star!

173
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,550
Aren't you glad that someone wants to marry her?

174
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,740
He's got a sword in his belt, so that means he's important at least, right?

175
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,730
This is your meal ticket, baby!

176
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,980
Get yourself hitched before he discovers what you're really like!

177
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,660
What's that supposed to mean?!

178
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,630
At first, I thought he was going to give up, so I didn't give it much thought.

179
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,610
But... he's shown up no matter where I went.

180
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,210
It hit me that he's not normal.

181
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,440
All right, thirty seconds left.

182
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,160
All right, the home stretch!

183
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,060
Stop chewing, Kagura.

184
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,470
Chug it.  Please!  I didn't being any cash!

185
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,630
Are you two even listening?!

186
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,400
What? You expect me to do something?

187
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,080
If you want me to take a job, then show me the money.

188
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,990
Gin, you know you haven't paid me in, like two months.

189
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,300
I could sue you.

190
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,370
Can't pay you.  Even if we do go to court.

191
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,290
Come on. If you don't find some motivation you're gonna lose your spot as star of the show.

192
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,940
Stalker-Pervert, where are ya?! Come out and get your ass handed to you!

193
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,150
What did you say?!

194
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,060
Bring it on if you can!

195
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,030
He was really here.

196
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,800
Boy, you sure are stupid to pop up when someone calls for a stalker.

197
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,020
So you admit you're stalker?

198
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,900
Everyone is a stalker in search of love.

199
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,500
Listen jerk! A little while ago I saw you getting all chummy with Otae.

200
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,990
Just what the hell is your relationship with her?

201
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,740
I'm uncontrollably jealous!

202
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,360
We're engaged.

203
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,340
I'm going to marry him in the fall.

204
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,370
Really?

205
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,420
We're already lovers.  He's defiled me this way and that way and every other way.

206
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,050
So give up already.

207
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,550
Th-this and th-that? And other thing, too?!

208
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,470
No, they haven't done the other thing yet.

209
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,220
Fine, Otae.

210
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,330
I don't care how skanky you are.

211
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,200
I accept you all the same.

212
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,170
Huh?

213
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,100
Just like how you love me, hairy ass and all.

214
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,070
I don't love you!

215
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,000
Hey, you wavy-silver-haired bastard!

216
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,380
It doesn't matter if you're Otae's fiancé!

217
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,670
I love Otae more than you ever can!

218
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,110
I'm calling you out!  Winner takes Otae!

219
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,610
I shouldn't have made up such a pointless lie.

220
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,130
Indeed. Seems to have just egged him on.

221
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,730
And that guy must be pretty strong.

222
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,100
Look how relaxed he is right before your duel.

223
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,880
Like he's faced certain death many times before.

224
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,640
Don't worry.

225
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,860
If Gin's in danger... My umbrella will unleash hell on earth, Sis.

226
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,400
Try not to kill him.

227
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,090
Hey, four-eyes! Where'd he go?!

228
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,430
Who are you calling "four-eyes"? He said he had to go to the can!

229
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,480
That's awfully confident of him!

230
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,690
Our reporting team has received information about an unruly drunk downtown.

231
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,820
We've headed to the scene!

232
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,070
You idiot! Can't I drink during the day?

233
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,370
[Voice changed to protect his privacy.]

234
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,780
Since when was it against the law?!

235
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,120
Edo's protectors, the Shinsengumi have already arrived.

236
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,220
Arrived.

237
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,410
Arri...

238
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,160
Now?! They just got here?!

239
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,610
Bleep! Bleep!

240
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,910
Hey, you lush!

241
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,210
There's no point in putting up a fight. Surrender...

242
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,510
What?! Who're you calling a lush?!

243
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,300
This doesn't even count as drinking.

244
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,200
Boy!

245
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,470
Hijikata, can we kill him?

246
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,680
Wait.

247
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,020
There are cameras.

248
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,390
Don't be so quick on the draw.

249
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,960
You bastard! You got puke on my pant leg.

250
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,860
What are you going to do about it?

251
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,160
Hey, everyone, hold Hijikata back!

252
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,670
You imbeciles! Let me go!

253
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,970
I'm going to drag him around town and cut his head off!

254
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,270
Vice chief, calm down!

255
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,030
The cameras are still rolling!

256
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,830
Don't film this.

257
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,280
What are they doing?

258
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,380
Well, it looks like a duel!

259
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,720
A duel? Oh?

260
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,860
Don't see that much these days!

261
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,910
Rice crackers and caramel candy.

262
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,620
How about a soda?

263
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,670
Hey, is he ready yet?! He didn't run off, did he?!

264
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,310
Dumbass. I wouldn't run away from an opponent like you.

265
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,740
You came!

266
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,210
You're late! Were you taking a dump?!

267
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,900
Taking a dump wouldn't be very heroic.

268
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,300
I took some sugar.

269
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,580
[Sugar]

270
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,040
Never heard of a hypoglycemic hero before!

271
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,590
What a nice sunset.

272
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,000
Duels are best at sunset.

273
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,710
You've got some grace for a man with wavy silver hair.

274
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,050
And you speak pretty well for a gorilla.

275
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,340
I-I'm not a gorilla! I may look like one, but I'm not.

276
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,960
Whatever. Shall we get started?

277
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Choose your weapons.

278
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,660
If you want to use a real sword, I'll lend you one.

279
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,040
Whatever you like.

280
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,850
This is good enough for me.

281
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,390
Let's do this.

282
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,400
Are you tryin' to make a fool out of me, butthead?

283
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,500
Sorry, but I'm not noble enough to duel over someone else's life.

284
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,330
As a substitute, I'll wager my life instead.

285
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,860
I'm going to wager my life instead of Otae's.

286
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,980
Even if you win, you don't get Otae.

287
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,500
But I'll be out of your way...

288
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,660
You can court her or whatever you'd like afterwards.

289
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,420
Of course, if I win you'll keep your paws off her.

290
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,670
He's going to put himself in the path of a naked blade,

291
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,020
and protect me even if he loses?!

292
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,590
Wait!  Stop right there!  Gin!

293
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,350
You sure are a man amongst men.

294
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,330
I think you're more popular with men than women.

295
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,960
Boy!  Lend me your wooden sword!

296
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,510
You're a good man, too.

297
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,920
Use this. It's my favorite sword, Lake Toya.

298
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,620
Gin!

299
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,950
Win or lose, we won't hold any grudges, right?

300
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,800
You got it.

301
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,190
Now, let's have a fair fight, man to man.

302
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,700
Let's go!

303
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,160
A fair...

304
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,770
duel!

305
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,380
Huh?

306
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,630
What?!

307
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,950
Hold on a second!  The blade!  The t-t-tip!

308
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,150
It's missiiinnggg!

309
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,020
Sucker...sweeter than Tianjin roasted chestnuts.

310
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,220
I can't believe you'd accept a weapon from your enemy!

311
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,030
When I went to the john,

312
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,240
I scored it with a deep cut, so deep it would split just from being swung.

313
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,060
You bastard!  You'd go that far?!

314
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,200
Only a total dork would try to settle something so important like this.

315
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,520
Isn't it better to just mellow out and talk things through?

316
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,420
This is mellowing out?

317
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,480
Hey. Wha'dya think of my brilliant plan?

318
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,480
I've lost all faith in you!  That's not samurai spirit!

319
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,150
You feel satisfied now, cheater?!  Coward!

320
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,620
What are you saying! I defended your sister.

321
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,660
I'm going home!

322
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,750
I never want to see your face again!

323
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,230
I'm going on vacation for a while.

324
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,360
Everything ended well.

I feel like warmed over kitty litter.

327
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,100
What a klutz.

328
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,930
But, I'm starting to get you.

329
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
The Shinsengumi's vice chief, Toshiro Hijikata.

330
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,500
He quietly patrols the city by himself even after a rough job.

331
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,700
What could he be seeing right now?

332
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,300
What's the fuss?

333
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,270
Well, there was a duel over a woman.

Chief Kondo.

337
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,580
Chief Kondo?

338
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,360
That's the Shinsengumi's chief...

339
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
Isao Kondo?

340
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,560
You idiot! What are you filming?!

341
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,140
Because of the work of the Shinsengumi, peace in Edo has been upheld.

342
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,740
Really?

Where's the guy that attacked Chief Kondo?!

He may be a gorilla, but he's our leader!

Hey. Close your textbooks for a moment.

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,410
Listen, Shimura's recorder has been stolen.

360
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,060
The thief may be in another class,

If you do it now, Shimura and I will forgive you

365
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,860
if you shove the recorder up your butt and play a chorus of "Please Give Me Wings."

366
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,730
Sensei, we'd never grow wings if we did that.

367
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,840
Change the song to Match's hit song, "Settle It."

368
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,340
All right. Match's hit song, "Shy About My Butt Hair".

369
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,230
Sensei, I don't know how that song goes.

370

You just made up that song title.

Okay, someone lend me a recorder. I'll play it.

Hey, I don't care who, somebody lend me your recorder.  A cute girl preferably.

376
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,660
No way!  It'll end up tasting like cigarettes.

377
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,850
I told you, this isn't a cigarette. It's a lollipop.

378
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,270
Smoke doesn't come out of lollipops.

379
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,980
That's because I've licked it so much.

Anyway, one of you girls, lend me your recorder! I'll lick and play it.

Sensei, use mine. It's okay if it starts to smell like cigarettes.  I have two of them.

Why do you have two of them?
