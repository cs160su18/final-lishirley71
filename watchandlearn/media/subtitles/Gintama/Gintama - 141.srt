2
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,850
My, my. What an unexpected guest.

3
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,010
The Harusame Seventh Division Commander,

4
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,630
Kamui-dono.

5
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,900
Earth food sure is good, Sir Housen.

6
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,220
The Seventh Division... Harusame's feared and unrivaled Lightning Spear.

7
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,180
What business could one who has achieved so much at such a young age

8
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,770
have at my humble abode?

9
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,930
You're too much, Sir.

10
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,370
You're the one who created the Seventh Division,

11
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,250
and then you left me with all the responsibilities...

12
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,750
so you could retire here peacefully.

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,710
It's unfair.

14
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,940
As people age, their bodies and hearts change.

15
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,400
What relieves the body is sake.

16
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,870
What relieves the heart is women.

17
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,560
Perhaps you're too young to understand?

18
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,100
No, I understand.

19
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,960
Oh? So you've learned the taste of things other than food since I've last seen you?

20
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,940
Do you want sake? Women?

21
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,500
Just tell me.

22
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,480
In that case...

23
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,690
One night with Hinowa.

24
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,820
As you can see, I've come prepared with a gift.

25
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,370
She'd be glad to serve me, don't you think?

26
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,650
You don't want Hinowa to be tainted by someone else?

27
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,930
You don't want this boy to take Hinowa away?

28
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,850
You don't want to be parted from Hinowa?

29
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,220
Be silent you-!

30
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,920
I wouldn't want to grow old...

31
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,360
It seems the one known as Night King Housen would be inept if it weren't for that one woman.

32
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,700
Yoshiwara - a woman's hell, yet a man's paradise.

33
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,080
Well, not quite.

34
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,910
This place, Sir,

35
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,860
is a paradise you built for yourself.

36
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,360
Kamui, I said to be silent.

37
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,170
It's a prison where a pitiful old man whom nobody pays attention to...

38
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,340
keeps cute dolls chained to his side.

39
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,620
Can you not hear me, Kamui?

40
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,250
A man drunk on sake is distinctive,

41
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,750
but a man drunk on a woman is just unsightly.  Right?

42
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,880
You old pervert?

43
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,120
Did you bastards come to check up on me?

44
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,810
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

45
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,340
They're orders from above, aren't they?

46
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,790
Have those old bastards finally begun to fear the great strength of Yoshiwara?

47
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,330
Is the Night King that hangs out in Yoshiwara becoming a nuisance?

48
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,790
Do you think you can defeat Night King Housen?

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,470
Well, you may be correct, but you wouldn't want to take on Harusame head on, would you?

50
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,370
It would be in your best interest to think before you act...

51
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,860
That would be a problem.

52
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,950
If you do that, then what do I do about this thirst of mine?

53
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,040
Women and sake don't cut it...

54
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,930
I don't need things like that.

55
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,290
They wouldn't be able to quench my thirst.

56
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,730
Blood...

57
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,220
The blood of Asura.

58
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,740
Only when I'm with someone of equal or greater blood than mine,

59
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,470
does my soul cry out in ecstacy.

60
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,310
I heard that you rebelled and tried to kill each other...

61
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,880
but you can't deny your blood.

62
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,830
Your eyes are just like his...

63
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,860
Long ago...

64
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,880
When I, the Night King, reigned atop the Yato, only he ever refused to swear allegiance.

65
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,400
The man who challenged me all by himself...

66
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,800
Your father,

67
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,200
Umibouzu's eyes.

68
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,130
I remember those three days and nights like they were yesterday.

69
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,060
He was the first to last that long against me.

70
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,820
He was also the first person I was unable to settle a fight with.

71
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,640
And then...

72
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,840
Excuse me... but I need to take a dump.

73
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,120
It was the first time I had ever ended a fight like that as well.

74
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,100
Kamui, can you surpass your father?

75
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,600
I've surpassed him long ago.

76
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,350
Tied up by trifling issues like his obligation to his family and whatnot..

77
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,650
A frail man like that who loses his arm to his own child...

78
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,790
cannot obtain true strength.

79
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,580
Sir, you are similar to that man.

80
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,990
Even though you look strong, there is nothing but sake and women inside you.

81
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,370
A true warrior needs a strong body in addition to a strong soul.

82
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,210
I have nothing holding me back and only strive for power.

83
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,750
You guys can't beat me.

84
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,930
Keep talking, brat!

85
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,460
Don't do it, commander!

86
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,500
If only I had let you go sooner...

88
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,270
There's no need to apologize.

89
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,500
Are you going?

90
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,340
If we don't go, Seita-kun will die.

91
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,740
If you go, you'll die too.

92
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,300
There are four Yato.

93
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,380
An entire army wouldn't be enough.

94
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,350
I have to do something about him.

95
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,690
For whose sake are you going?

96
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,000
Is it for Seita? Hinowa?

97
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,780
I'm going out for a bit to get some sun.

98
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,070
The same one that everyone's forgotten about...

99
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,490
after living their lives out in this dump of a place.

100
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,200
No matter where you are,

101
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,850
no matter how scared you are,

102
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,490
the Sun is there.

103
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,110
It's neither Hinowa nor Tsuji-chan's husband.

104
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,240
Your sun...

105
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,510
is often covered by clouds.

106
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,160
But if you continue to watch the sky, it will eventually make its way through the clouds.

107
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,390
That's why... we must never lose sight of that.

108
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,280
We must never stop staring at the sky.

109
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,360
Stand up straight,

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,400
watch the heavens,

111
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,510
and continue to live your life.

112
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,720
Tell everyone you see who looks depressed...

113
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,100
to watch the skies.

114
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,500
In this filthy, lead-colored sky...

115
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,640
we're going to put up a ridiculously huge sun.

116
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,700
Sorry, but I refuse.

117
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Because I'll be going with you.

118
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,970
We can't bring someone who belongs to Yoshiwara to a fight against Yoshiwara.

119
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,310
You'll become a traitor.

120
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,000
I've told you already.

121
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,590
I protect Hinowa.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,050
Not once have I sworn loyalty to Yoshiwara.

123
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,990
For me, it is even more treacherous to stand by and watch Seita die.

124
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,360
Besides...

125
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,950
Instead of continuing to depend on others, I'd rather look for it myself...

126
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,200
this so called sun you speak of.

127
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,090
Don't blame me if you have nowhere to return to.

128
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,400
It's alright.

129
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,440
You're going to crush Yoshiwara anyway, right?

130
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,180
Commander, stop it!

131
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,340
Did you forget our objective?!

132
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,830
Stop, Ungyou!

133
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,490
Com-

134
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,480
Stay put.

135
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,770
I'm having fun right now.

136
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,200
If you interfere again,

137
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,950
I'll kill you.

138
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,960
Commander!

139
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,850
I told you...

140
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,090
The commander's bad habit's taken over him again.

141
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,850
Once he gets like that, nobody can stop him.

142
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,570
As expected of Night King Housen, the man who once stood atop the Yato.

143
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,560
It seems like succeeding you isn't a simple task.

144
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,470
Succeed me?

145
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,500
Don't make me laugh.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,070
Kamui, you don't believe in hierarchies.

147
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,470
You only believe in the difference between the strong and the weak.

148
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,630
You don't bother yourself with the weak.

149
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,270
But against the strong, it doesn't matter who it is.

150
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,860
You would even bare your fangs against your master.

151
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,250
That's just how the Yato blood is.

152
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,940
While you were happily drowning yourself in sake and women,

153
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,010
did your blood dry out?

154
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,100
Beating you as you are now would be no fun at all.

155
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,950
Please try to remember...

156
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,760
the blood of Asura that flows through you.

157
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,760
Silence.

158
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,020
You don't belong in a place like this.

159
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,140
I said to be silent.

160
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,710
You belong...

161
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,510
That's right...

162
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,530
We belong on the battlefield.

163
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,470
There it is again. It's from Housen-sama's room!

164
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,240
Shouldn't we go check it out?

165
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,160
Our friends are already on the way.

166
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,790
It's at times like this that we can't loosen security.

167
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,860
You don't know if an intruder will infiltrate through the gaps, right?

168
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,750
Exactly.

169
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,990
Boss!

170
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,350
That's enough. Both of you need to calm down.

171
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,310
My arm and his life were worth stopping your fight.

172
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,780
Please don't let his death be in vain and forgive our commander's misconduct.

173
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,350
Killing what few clan members we have left makes me uneasy.

174
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,670
We didn't come here to start a war with you.

175
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,770
We came to strengthen our relationship.

176
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,350
Why don't you just admit that you want this town?

177
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,820
The higher-ups are scared as well...

178
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,980
As one of us, we know your strength the best.

179
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,350
The old men just want proof that you won't betray them.

180
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,360
Quite the friends they are.

181
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,190
They're extorting a retired old man trying to peacefully live out the rest of his life.

182
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,040
I've lost interest.

183
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,470
Sir...

184
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,130
If money is what you want, take as much you want.

185
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,110
Things like that are worthless to me now.

186
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,990
However...

187
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,420
This town...

188
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,420
If you try to steal my country,

189
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,800
I will show you the true strength of the Night King.

190
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,140
I'm the one who has lost interest.

191
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,680
Is the toy you've made that precious?

192
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,170
If so, you should just wither away here.

193
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,790
It's not even worth killing you.

194
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,100
Wither away?

195
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,780
I started withering away long ago...

196
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,770
How have I shriveled so much when the Sun doesn't even reach me?

197
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,530
Where have you been this whole time?

198
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,540
Removal operations for the collapsed pipe.

199
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,740
But I'm glad. We can relax now that you're here, Boss.

200
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,700
Leave Housen-sama's matter to me.

201
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,340
I'll count on you guys to guard this place.

202
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:13,710
Roger!

203
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,590
Listen up. Don't let even one conspicuous person through.

204
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,580
If they're even a little suspicious, call 911.

205
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,910
I give you permission.

206
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,640
There won't be any mercy if you mess up.

207
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,770
Boss, they're suspicious.

208
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,010
Actually... no, they're not.

209
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,400
They're... um... new recruits.

210
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,410
New recruits?!

211
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,170
These suspicious people are?!

212
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,770
I'm Paako.

213
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,490
I'm Pachie.

214
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,290
I'm Gurako.

215
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,720
The three of us combined...

216
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,090
are the Three Bursting Peach Best Friends!

217
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,740
Boss, they're suspicious.

218
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,250
No... I said they're new recruits.

219
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,090
Are you sure you want to bring them?

220
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,050
Housen-sama is going to burst!

221
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,040
From his crotch?

222
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,460
No way!

223
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,240
Look in a mirror, Three Silicon Best Friends!

224
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,440
Bringing such useless people is dangerous!

225
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,040
It'll be okay. It's Chinhou-sama we're talking about.

226
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,830
He's just slipping into another woman. Don't get so worked up.

227
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,370
Who's Chinhou-sama? It's Housen-sama!

228
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,900
How would "slipping into someone" create a racket like that?!

229
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,410
Well, he is called the Night King, right?

230
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,480
He's got to have a loaded bazooka, right?

231
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,120
That's not what it means!

232
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,920
They may be new recruits, but they're skilled.

233
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,610
You don't need to worry.

234
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,650
If you say so, Boss.

235
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,240
Please go through.

236
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,710
We did it. It looks like we fooled them!

237
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,480
Please be careful...

238
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,530
on the journey to your next life!

239
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,050
It seems...

240
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,860
that whole act was a waste of time.

241
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,790
They saw through everything.

242
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,610
Boss...

243
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,780
To think you would assist the intruders...

244
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,360
You should know best what happens when you betray Yoshiwara.

245
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,810
Is that so?

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,250
What happens? Please tell us.

247
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,460
There are so many of you gathered here, are you guys throwing a goodbye party?

248
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,070
Gin-san, it really is goodbye.

249
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,020
What is?

250
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,570
What do you mean "what is"? How many times have you been hit?!

251
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,800
Is there a black hole on your forehead or something?!

252
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,220
What is? Nothing hit me.

253
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,320
You were hit!

254
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,930
Your face is obviously turning red. You're embarrassed!

255
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,010
Oi, get it together.

256
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,280
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

257
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,430
You were hit, right? You were obviously hit there, right?

258
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,470
If you guys start out like that, I'm worried about what's to come.

259
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,050
You guys... at this rate, you won't be able to beat the Night King in a hundred years!

260
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,910
I'm just not going to comment.

261
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,810
I should probably leave her be, right?

262
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,070
It's better she doesn't know, right?

263
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,110
Death to traitors. That is the law here.

264
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,180
You should give up your life in order to protect our laws one last time!

265
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,640
This is great...

266
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,880
Everybody working together to get the job done is more than a man like me deserves.

267
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,550
However...

268
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,250
If you're all flat-chested, I'll lose interest.

269
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,610
A woman needs...

270
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,680
giant melons!

271
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,120
Now then, let's kick off this party with a bang!

272
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,940
You guys go get the children!

273
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,310
We'll head towards the intruders!

274
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,420
Quite the commotion.

275
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,630
Better than the one you started.

276
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,780
What? You're still mad?

277
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,760
If you don't learn to let go, you won't live a long life.

278
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,060
Well, one of us is already dead.

279
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,240
Hey. You intended to mix it up with Housen from the start, didn't you?

280
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,000
Was it obvious?

281
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,860
"Was it obvious" my ass! Dammit.

282
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,110
Thanks to you, our bargaining chip got away during the confusion.

283
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,220
Oh, you mean that boy? I totally forgot about him.

284
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,660
Getting away in the middle of that is quite a feat.

285
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,070
I look forward to his future.

286
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,890
Now's not the time for admiration.

287
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,860
We don't need a bargaining chip.

288
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,700
If we want Yoshiwara, all we have to do is kill Housen.

289
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,010
Are you an idiot?

290
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,320
If our actions cause a war between Harusame and the Night King,

291
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,570
the higher-ups are going to kill us!

292
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,280
If that happens,

293
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,080
I'll slaughter the higher-ups too.

294
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,180
And after that, are you going to become the Pirate King?

295
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,740
That sounds nice.

296
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,740
If I move up, I'll be able to meet people just as strong.

297
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,910
Yeah, yeah.

298
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,180
We're blessed to have a commander with such... great aspirations.

299
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,660
God dammit.

300
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,120
Where are you going, Abuto?

301
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,380
Let's leave already.

302
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,220
Then go.  Go home before that scary old man kills you.

303
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,680
I can't just leave while I still owe Housen a favor.

304
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,130
We underlings are responsible for wiping the commander's butt.

305
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,350
No, maybe I'll go pave the way for the Pirate King.

306
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,320
Good luck.

307
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,180
This is... a smoke bomb?

308
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,090
They're looking down on us. Are they saying they can't cut down women?

309
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,860
Over there!

310
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,310
I'll hold them back here for a while.

311
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,920
Go on ahead.

312
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,130
Tsukuyo-san!

313
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,310
Do you want to die?

314
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,210
The boss needs to discipline her subordinates.

315
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,940
Hand over your pipe.

316
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,290
It'll be a problem if it disappears with you.

317
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,760
I won't be able to use this.

318
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,030
It may be my last, so one last dra-

319
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,170
No, hand it over.

320
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,710
Gin-san, are you really going to leave her behind?

321
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,810
If you want to smoke that much, come back for it.

322
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,630
Make sure you come back to smoke it.

323
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,950
If you don't make it quick, I'll drool all over it.

324
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,800
Gin-chan...

325
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,620
Hurry, you guys go on too.

326
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,430
Don't make me repeat myself.

327
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,960
Hinowa is the only person I'd ever give up my life for.

328
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,080
I don't have enough lives to throw one away protecting the likes of you.

329
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,580
Go quickly.

330
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,110
That's right.

331
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,860
I'm a guard dog that lays down its life to defend Hinowa.

332
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,870
My sun...

333
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,470
Yoshiwara's sun...

334
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,700
The guiding light of Yoshiwara.

335
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,090
I'm prepared to die.

336
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,220
Come at me however you may,

337
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,870
but I won't let even one of you pass me.

338
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,670
The Guardian Dog of the Sun, Tsukuyo!

339
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,060
Here I go!

340
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,020
Out of the way, dammit!

341
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,140
Hurry! To the Night King!

342
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,960
Seita-kun must be there!

343
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,330
Kagura-chan!

344
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,110
What a surprise.

345
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,640
I was wondering who it was, so it's you guys.

346
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,140
I see you survived.

347
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,910
If the commander heard, he'd be elated...

348
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,850
that there are Earthlings that actually have some muscle in them.

349
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,350
You finally show yourself.

350
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,080
One, two, three.

351
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:36,360
Assuming I just killed that one, you're still missing one person.

352
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,720
Oi, stop daydreaming!

353
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,160
Who's an Earthling?

354
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,400
Don't compare me to these country bumpkins.

355
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,860
I was born and raised a city girl.
