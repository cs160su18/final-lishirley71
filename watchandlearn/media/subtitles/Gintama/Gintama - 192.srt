00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,630
Can't you tell...?

3
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,780
I used to be a human, same as you guys.

4
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,420
Until that point, I had taken away many
things that could never be replaced.

5
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,060
But I would use this body,

6
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,130
the precious body he gave me,

7
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,960
to protect those things that
can never be replaced.

8
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,530
This town doesn't need a boss.

9
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,900
We're gonna live free!

10
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,100
An uprising?

11
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,840
I'm leaving the rest to you.

12
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,080
Hoichi!

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,070
What are you doing?! Hurry up!

14
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,570
We're leaving the rest to you, Odd Jobs!

15
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,610
Grant the stray cats of Kabukicho!

16
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,010
And their proud king!

17
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,590
True freedom!

["Kabukicho Stray Cat Blues"]

19
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,750
Well, that should do it.

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,130
We've captured most of
the strays in Kabukicho.

21
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,110
Thank you for your cooperation.

22
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,640
Well? Are there any to your liking?

23
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,670
B-Bro...

24
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,230
What's with the feeble old cat?

25
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,790
Moron! Don't make any
stupid comments.

26
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,860
The cats will rip you apart and eat you.

27
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,870
That's their king.

28
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,620
Huh?! That old geezer's the
king of Planet Catnip?!

29
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,120
Moron! You're too loud!

30
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,470
Why? Why's he here?

31
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,650
Wouldn't the king coming
to Edo be big news?!

32
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,340
I never heard a word about it!

33
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,390
He's obviously being discreet because he
doesn't want people to know he's here!

34
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,910
Doesn't want people
to know he's here...?

35
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,640
Meow!

36
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,980
Greetings, everyone.

37
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,850
What's with that old geezer?!

38
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,160
He can speak our language?!

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,060
Meow!

40
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,480
It is a pleasure to meet
you, cats of Earth.

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,470
Meow-yeow.

42
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,890
I apologize for any inconvenience
caused by assembling you here.

43
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,740
I must confess that I have
a favor to ask of you.

44
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,240
Hey, he's pretty talkative for someone
who looks the quiet type.

45
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,760
Mew.

46
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,850
We may come from different planets,

47
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,490
but we belong to the same race, which
is why I hope you'll be willing to help.

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,000
Meow.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,210
I am actually the king
of a certain planet...

50
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,120
Purr.

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,640
I have grown old without
producing any children.

52
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,910
Meorw.

53
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,510
And I must say that my wife
is a dead fish in bed.

54
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,530
Of course, I love fish,
at least the edible kind.

55
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,150
I mean, I'm a cat.

56
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,370
Hey! That geezer's spillin' everything
to total strangers!

57
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,050
Mrrow.

58
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,350
She won't budge or make a
sound, no matter what I do.

59
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,700
Practically copulationless.

60
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,890
I've become a master at going solo.

61
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,370
And I'm used to a curved faucet,

62
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,450
so normal sex completely fails to...

63
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,450
Hey!

64
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,710
We don't want to hear this!

65
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,250
Why do we have to listen to an old
geezer's sexual preferences?!

66
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,480
Myao.

67
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,620
I took a new wife,

68
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,020
but by that time, I could
no longer get it up.

69
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,940
Meows.

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,010
My nation is currently in an
uproar over succession.

71
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,090
Meyow.

72
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,460
That is why I must ask a favor of you.

73
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,790
Hey, aren't we about to get lucky?

74
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,400
I heard something about losing
our souls, though...

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,810
Maybe this geezer brought us
here to pick a successor...

76
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,300
Meowzer.

77
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,090
Could you all please give me your balls?

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,660
Why?!

79
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,670
What kind of twisted logic is that?!

80
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,770
Meow-ow.

81
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,380
There is an ancient legend on our planet.

82
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,930
Nagas.

83
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,760
[Note: Parody of the manga "Dragon Ball".]

84
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,760
When the legendary "Golden
Balls" are assembled,

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,530
Meowes.

86
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,280
Shenlong will be awakened from
its slumber in the earth,

87
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,940
Meowlos.

88
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,970
Will you assist in awakening

89
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,670
Meow.

90
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,340
my slumbering Shenlong?

91
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,640
That king plans on extracting cat balls

92
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,690
to produce the potent aphrodisiac
Catnip Omega!

93
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,130
Don't talk about Shenlong,
you sick geezer!

94
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,280
Screw that!

95
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,780
Why do we have to give up our balls to
help wake up your withered Shenlong?!

96
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,130
Meowsus.

97
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,410
Your Golden Balls, brimming with
virility, are the ideal ingredient.

98
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,760
Meowgos.

99
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,920
But this isn't enough.

100
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,590
Meof.

101
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,810
Your Golden Balls can shine brighter.

102
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,170
Where are we...?

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,810
Meows.

104
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,720
Do you know when seeds have
the greatest survivability?

105
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,620
It isn't when you find a DVD-porn that
perfectly matches your tastes.

106
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,230
Nor is it when you encounter
a ravishing female cat.

107
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,240
It is when your life is in danger.

108
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,260
When faced with absolute death,

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,230
Golden Balls shine brightest in an attempt
to leave its seed in this world.

110
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,540
N-No way...

111
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,320
Is that geezer planning on...

112
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,530
Now tremble in fear!

113
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,710
You are currently faced
with imminent death!

114
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,810
Now, grant the Golden Balls light!

115
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,190
Fuel it with all your energy!

116
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,860
There's no need to worry!

117
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,950
If you end up as corpses, I won't
let your Golden Balls go to waste!

118
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,200
He's gonna kill us!

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,290
Eat us up, leaving only our balls behind!

120
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,750
I won't let you pass...

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,010
I won't let you get one step past me.

122
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:35,690
Any further and you're on the turf of
Hoichi, king of Kabukicho strays.

123
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,730
I-It's standing! On two legs!
Wh-What is that?!

124
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,400
What is up with that cat?!

125
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,950
It's the king.

126
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,460
That is the boss cat which
rules over Kabukicho...

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,910
Reigning over the stray cats...

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,520
Hoichi, the stray king.

129
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,420
M-Magnificent!

130
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,010
The vitality! Courage!

131
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,300
Brimming with virility!

132
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,930
Ho-Hoichi...!

133
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,940
Why? Why?!

134
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,400
Why is he helping us after
what we did to him?!

135
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,570
WHY?!

136
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,050
Come on...

137
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,950
Hold on a little longer...

138
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,210
Just a little longer...

139
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,670
Hang in there...

140
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,110
Don't fall apart on me...

141
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,640
This guy's the last one...

142
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,610
Lend me your body...

143
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,350
A little longer...!!

144
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,570
You awake?

145
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,090
So you're the stray who's been making a
name for himself in Kabukicho recently.

146
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,080
You're a fool to pick fights with dogs.

147
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,460
Good thing you only lost your ears.

148
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,920
You're quite a handsome one.

149
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,350
There's no need to worry.

150
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,370
The charge you were protecting
is fine as you can see.

151
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,540
Well, it ran off.

152
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,040
You're not very well-liked.

153
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,290
I was wondering why it felt like
this wasn't our first meeting.

154
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,570
You're exactly like him.

155
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,060
I once picked up another stray.

156
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,890
On the verge of death, just like you,
lying on the side of the road...

157
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,910
A stupid cat that was your
match in every way.

158
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,140
I don't know how he ended
up there though.

159
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,490
Always seemed as though he
were looking for something.

160
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,660
Butting in where he wasn't wanted
and pitting his own body

161
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,470
to protect the things that were
important for other people.

162
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,050
Almost like he was trying
to atone for something.

163
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,870
Meanwhile, he kept nothing for himself.

164
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,560
Didn't get close to anyone.

165
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,150
He was always alone...

166
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,410
Just like you...

167
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,740
Maybe he was afraid of enduring
the pain of loss again...

168
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,700
Maybe he didn't want others
to experience what he had...

169
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,230
Perhaps he was trying to punish himself.

170
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,910
But you know...

171
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,780
There were other strays who
were drawn to that idiot.

172
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,790
Soon he could no longer stay alone.

173
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,510
Maybe he just learned from them.

174
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,650
That fatalism won't make anyone happy.

175
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:58,730
Friends to protect, who protected him,
may have given him the strength to move on.

176
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,520
You protect and suffer losses.

177
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,340
You're protected and suffer losses.

178
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,530
But then you take on a new burden.

179
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,350
In the end, it's just a cycle.

180
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,250
That's life.

181
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,450
Rough, isn't it?

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,960
But you know, when I see the expressions
on those three faces,

183
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,800
I start to feel that it's not too bad.

184
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,050
Why am I saying all this to a cat?

185
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,930
When I saw you rampaging
around on your own,

186
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,630
I was somehow reminded
of how he used to be.

187
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,290
Live positively.

188
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,220
I'm sure you have friends
waiting to support you.

189
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,280
The ones you care for would
want you to do so...

190
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,290
I can't be positive, Granny...

191
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,290
I can't make anything happen
by being positive...

192
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:07,800
I don't deserve any friends when I
couldn't even protect my only pal...

193
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,640
I forgot how to make friends
a long time ago.

194
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:23,400
Still, even if I couldn't make friends,
I wanted to protect them.

195
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,860
I wanted to protect something with these
hands, instead of taking from others...

196
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,620
Sorry I couldn't protect you
all till the very end...

197
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,190
I'm a failure

198
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,890
of a boss cat...

199
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,230
Pal, I broke another promise...

200
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,220
Sorry...

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,580
Gi-

202
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,820
Gin!!

203
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,430
Gi-

204
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,500
Gin!!

205
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,560
What is that cat?!

206
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,420
Th-That's...

207
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,900
The newbie!

208
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Bastards!

209
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,560
Did you hear what he said?!

210
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,180
He just voluntarily gave up
his position as boss cat!

211
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,240
From this point on, Kabukicho
will be a city of free strays!

212
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,150
Kabukicho no longer has a boss cat!

213
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,090
From now on, you're free
to do whatever you want!

214
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,280
Live by your own rules!

215
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,090
Now that you're free, let's test those
free-minded idea of yours!

216
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,450
Think long and hard before you answer!

217
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,420
He's no longer the boss cat!

218
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,670
So who is this dirty rag-like Doraemon?!

219
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:18,890
Who is this pathetic Mr. Frieza who bled
for you, got beaten to a pulp for you?!

220
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,100
He's just another

221
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,910
pal!

222
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,290
I-Impossible!

223
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,940
The strays are uniting!

224
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,610
This is...! This is...!!

225
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,440
M-Magnificent!

226
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,240
Witness that swarming wave of virility!

227
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,700
That's it! That is what is needed
for Catnip Omega...!

228
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,590
There's no time for that, your majesty!

229
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,710
We must evacuate!

230
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,990
It's dangerous here!

231
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,040
No!

232
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,570
I want my Catnip Omega
so I can be nippy!

233
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,810
Nippy I tell you!

234
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,230
Did you know?

235
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,360
Naughty cats...

236
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,740
...learn to behave if you neuter them.

237
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,780
Oh, really?

238
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,960
I've never heard that before...

239
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,400
But it's just a myth, a myth.

240
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,350
That couldn't be enough to
stop my burning pathos...

241
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,130
Why don't we find out?

242
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,120
Huh?

243
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,790
Bro, is it okay to ditch the king?

244
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,070
Don't blame me if we get in trouble later.

245
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,060
Are you a moron?

246
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,270
How could that fool be a king?

247
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,230
This wasn't a bad job.

248
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,020
Turned a pretty profit, and we
got to watch a fine show.

249
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,250
Of a true cat king...

250
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,180
Gin, you've really done it now...

251
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,070
Instead of succeeding me as boss cat,

252
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,780
you abolished monarchy and turned
Kabukicho into a lawless land.

253
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,080
They'll run wild now.

254
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,460
They'll be fine without a boss cat now.

255
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,130
Since they understand the pain
their pal's been through.

256
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,930
And you can forget all the
tedious stuff and live easy.

257
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,840
I...

258
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,530
Fatalism won't make anyone happy.

259
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,900
Live positively.

260
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,390
Your buddy didn't give you his
body to help you survive

261
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,650
for you to atone.

262
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:49,540
Don't you think he wanted his chained
friend to live free like a stray?

263
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,200
So I should live by my own
rules, as you put it?

264
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,180
That would be the Kabukicho way.

265
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,030
Gin, I have a favor to ask.

266
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,580
Don't worry.

267
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,220
I won't ask you to succeed
me as boss cat again.

268
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,210
I just...

269
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,920
I want to be pals with...

270
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,310
I've been thinking...

271
00:18:53,310 --> 00:19:00,030
The cats in this grave might
not have been cursing us.

272
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,050
Say, why are we back like this?

273
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:09,890
It's possible that they only wanted
us to save Master Hoichi.

274
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,140
Hey, doesn't something stink?

275
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,560
It's possible that they knew how
Master Hoichi was suffering.

276
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,380
Hey, you said something about
taking a dump here, right?

277
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,010
It's possible that I had diarrhea.

278
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,440
Possible, my ass!

279
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,380
It's damn obvious if you
were the one who did it!

280
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,370
Ah, it's true!

281
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,030
Katsura's really here!

282
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,410
Farewell, Gintoki!

283
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,690
Hey! Something weird's popped out!

284
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,060
Isn't this p-

285
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,900
Give my regards to Master Hoichi!

286
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,430
After him! After him!

287
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,350
It was just as Kondo-san said!

288
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,150
That's our commander for you!

289
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,570
By the way, where have you
been this whole time?

290
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,970
We were worried, Kondo-san.

291
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Kondo-san, you look different somehow.

292
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,090
Oh, did you cut your hair?

293
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,810
Give my regards to Master Hoichi?

294
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,100
Even if we run into one another,
he won't recognize us.

295
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,270
And it stinks!

296
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,160
I see.

297
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,840
So the strays were safely released
from the embassy.

298
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,970
Yes.

299
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,620
But they're still running wild,

300
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,220
so the neighborhood association is saying
that they should still be neutered.

301
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,720
So?

302
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,150
Gintoki's come back, right?

303
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,290
Ah, yes.

304
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,040
He didn't give us any details,

305
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,660
but he was apparently in a rough situation where
he couldn't have anything sweet to eat.

306
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,910
Thank you very much.

pissing, you damn stray?!
