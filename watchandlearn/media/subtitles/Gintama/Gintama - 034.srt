"The promising young pop star, TAMA. Her cat ears are so cute..."

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,970
Wasn't she the one with the debut song that beat out Otsu's?

[Note: Edocon is a parody of the Oricon, a Japanese music sales ranking.]

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,820
She's the one who pushed Otsu-chan to eighth place on the Edocon, wasn't it?

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,900
This makes me sick. What's so great about her?

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,100
If she didn't have ears, she'd be just like any typical pop star.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,850
Tell me about it. Cat ears are an abomination.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:32,810
But if Otsu-chan had cat ears, her popularity would go through the roof.

10

What are you saying, Sergeant?!

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,550
Otsu-chan doesn't need cat ears! Right now, she's at her best and her cutest.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,710
Takachin, it's a fact that a large number of people are attracted to cat ears.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,220
In other words, this discussion begins with the acknowledgement of that fact.

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,230
Indeed, Otsu-san is cute and has a beautiful voice.

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:59,300
But it's an undeniable fact that these qualities alone are not enough to sustain an idol in times like these.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,580
Aren't you the one who's denying the facts?!

23

That's exactly right!!

Honestly... Don't apologize. You were supposed to make a comment there.

You should've said something like "Dude! It's jokes like those that are destroying the world!"
