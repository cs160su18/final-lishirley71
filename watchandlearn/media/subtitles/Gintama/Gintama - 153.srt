Shinpachi...

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,880
I was dreaming...

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,030
Dreaming?

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,640
Yes... It was a happy dream...

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,040
I was working in Kabukicho...

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,410
I became the number one host...

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,620
and Kintoki was next to me...

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,890
And the owner of the place was Kagura-san...

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,570
Such a happy dream...

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,520
I wanted to become the number one host...

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,250
So badly...

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,690
I didn't choose to end up with this buttchin!

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,450
What's so bad about having a buttchin?!

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,640
There isn't anything wrong with a buttchin!

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,250
There might be customers who find a buttchin attractive, who knows!

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,540
Just stop!

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,250
Everybody should end up with butt-like chins.

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,410
All hope was lost as rain fell upon Kabukicho.

23
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,880
We lost our will to fight

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,080
and could only curse at the sky.

[To Be Continued with the Final Episode!!]

26
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,180
I can't sleep.

27
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,560
I can't sleep at all.

28
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,850
Can't sleep a wink.

29
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,660
The harder I try to fall asleep,

30
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,840
the more awake I feel.

31
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,860
I don't feel like sleeping at all.

33
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,500
What?

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,250
I can't sleep.

35
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,690
Oh, really...

36
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,930
Don't stay up too late.

37
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,830
We have work tomorrow.

38
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,130
What is it?

39
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,510
I can't sleep.

40
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,980
You already said that.

41
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,240
If you can't fall asleep, stay up until you're sleepy.

42
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,470
You're so annoying.

43
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,660
Let me sleep, okay?

44
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,910
I said we have work...

45
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,530
I can't sleep.

46
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,510
Hey! What are you doing?!

47
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,740
I can't sleep a wink at all.

48
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,640
Like I care!

49
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,410
Stop bugging me!

50
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,510
I can't sleep...

51
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,460
Put me to sleep.

52
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,100
Use everything in your power to put me to sleep.

53
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,420
Just go to sleep by yourself!

54
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,600
Is that how you ask somebody for a favor?!

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,940
Man...

56
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,160
I can't put up with this.

57
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,930
That futon looks more comfortable to sleep on.

58
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,310
Switch with me.

59
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,220
I'm gonna sleep there.

60
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,050
You sleep in the closet.

61
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,780
Don't be so picky.

62
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,590
All futons are the same!

63
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,030
How am I supposed to sleep in that small space?!

64
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,410
Just move outta the way.

65
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,900
Ah, I think I can fall asleep like this.

66
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,060
This futon might put me to sleep.

67
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,520
Never wake up again, stupid brat.

68
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,300
Man...

69
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,290
What is this...

70
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,470
I'd managed to fall asleep.

71
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,790
I don't wanna sleep on a cold futon.

72
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,500
I can't sleep.

73
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,930
So nothing changed?!

74
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,370
This is no use.

75
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,650
I don't feel sleepy at all.

76
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,910
I can't fall asleep 'cause the pillow smells like an old man.

77
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,270
You're the one who told me to switch with you!

78
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,610
That futon looks more comfortable to sleep on.

79
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,940
Switch with me.

80
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,370
This will never end!

81
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,840
I can't fall asleep

82
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
so I've been thinking of ways to fall asleep.

83
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,480
And now, I'm no longer sure how I used to fall asleep.

84
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,610
I've forgotten how to fall asleep.

85
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,520
How do I fall asleep?

86
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,890
How do I make my way into slumberland?

87
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,110
Start by shutting up!

88
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,030
Then close your eyes and stay still!

89
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,890
You'll eventually fall asleep.

90
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,010
But Gin-chan, when you stop and think about it,

91
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,210
what is sleep?

92
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,340
When we close our eyes, we're just shutting our eyelids.

93
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,400
Our eyeballs are still darting around.

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,480
It's completely dark, but that's because we're looking at the inside of our eyelids.

95
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,410
It doesn't mean we're asleep.

96
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,830
To prove it, if you close your eyes during the day, it's completely red.

97
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,510
What do I do with my eyeballs if I want to fall asleep?

98
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,360
Should I just stare at the inside of my eyelids?

99
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,880
Or should I look up?

100
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,420
What do I do to-

101
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,060
Cut it out!

102
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,640
Now I can't fall asleep!

103
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,400
What are you going to do about this?!

104
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,780
Now that you got me thinking about it, I can't fall asleep either!

105
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,440
Did I look up? Did I look down?

106
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,730
I don't know what to do with my eyeballs!

107
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,610
And do we breathe with our mouths when we sleep?

108
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,810
Or with our noses?

109
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,200
Or do we breathe in through our mouths and out through our noses?

110
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,350
Or do we breathe in through our noses and out through our mouths?

111
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,240
Cut it out!

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,230
Should I cross my arms?

113
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,500
Should I leave them at my sides?

114
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,080
Outside the covers?

115
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,230
Inside the covers?

116
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,330
How should the pillow be placed?

117
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,080
Face-up?

118
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,620
Face-down?

119
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,620
Cut it out!

120
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,070
Where do we come from? Where are we going?

121
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,100
What's beyond the edge of the universe?

122
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,490
Why doesn't anime make lots of money?

123
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,300
Cut it out!

124
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,740
I can't sleep!

125
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,920
I don't feel like sleeping at all!

126
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,230
Was it this hard to fall asleep?!

127
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,890
Did we go through such an ordeal every night?!

128
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,990
What is sleep again?

129
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,880
Shut up!

130
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,740
You'll never fall asleep if you make everything so complicated!

131
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,390
How much of a failure are you?!

132
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,690
Even Ken Takakura could do a better job!

133
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,700
[Note: Actor Ken Takakura is known for the phrase, "I'm a failure."]

134
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,700
I feel more and more awake.

135
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,960
What do I do?

136
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,490
At this rate, I'll never fall asleep for rest of my life.

137
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,550
Give me a break.

138
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,820
Didn't I tell you that we have work tomorrow?

139
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,280
It's 2:30 in the morning.

140
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,220
We have to wake up at 7:00 tomorrow.

141
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,920
We only have four and a half hours to sleep.

142
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,170
That'd even make Napoleon bitch when he woke up.

143
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,390
"My dictionary says I only sleep for three hours but read between the lines!"

144
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:19,140
[Note: Napoleon is known for only sleeping three hours a day. He is also known for the quote "The word impossible is not in my dictionary."]

145
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,140
What should I do?

146
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,310
Don't fall asleep before me, Gin-chan.

147
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,150
For now, stop thinking about that stuff.

148
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,580
Don't use your head.

149
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,340
Okay?

150
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,700
Sleep isn't supposed to be something you can consciously force.

151
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,610
Humans who live regular lives will naturally fall asleep at night.

152
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,500
If you work your sweaty ass off for a whole day,

153
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,580
you'll be so tired you can comfortably fall asleep.

154
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,070
That's how sleep is supposed to work.

155
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,210
I see...

156
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,840
I can't fall asleep because I was lying around the whole day.

157
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,140
Right?

158
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,510
The problem is with your lifestyle, not with your sleeping style.

159
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,590
["Don't just lay there! Help me clean up the house!"]

160
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,600
You're one to talk.

161
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,000
If you understand, go run a lap around town.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,750
What you lack is fatigue.

163
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,920
I got it.

164
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,020
I'm going off for a run.

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,110
Gin-chan, you can't fall asleep before me.

166
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,470
You'd better stay up.

167
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,250
Gin-chan...

168
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,470
Hey, Gin-chan...

169
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,460
I can't fall asleep.

170
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,070
I did the running...

171
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,220
But now...

172
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,630
I'm so hot...

173
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,050
I can't fall asleep.

174
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,690
Who told you to run as hard as you can?!

175
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,270
Of course you can't fall asleep when you're all sweaty like that!

176
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,990
I figured I'd fall asleep faster if I was more tired,

177
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,490
so I ran fifty laps around town.

178
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,870
Sleep is out of the question now.

179
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,220
It feels like all my cells have activated.

180
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,350
Feels like it?

181
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,000
Your brain cells are dying!

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,460
You can't fall asleep right after exercising so hard!

183
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,440
Go take a bath and cool yourself off!

184
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,600
You've gotten my futon all sweaty now!

185
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,300
No.

186
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,890
I don't have time for that.

187
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,340
I have to fall asleep as soon as possible.

188
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,850
You're a busy person, huh?

189
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,090
First you want to sleep.

190
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,230
Now you're hungry.

191
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,360
I envy you!

192
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,910
It must be fun to have so many things to do!

193
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,120
That isn't my stomach. I'm farting.

194
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,840
I don't care what it is! Can you be quiet?!

195
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,570
How long is that going to continue?!

196
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,390
It's so noisy I can't fall asleep.

197
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,110
Fine.

198
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,050
I'll go make you something to eat.

199
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,330
You go take a bath during that time.

200
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,360
Food?!

201
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,970
Everybody feels like sleeping after a meal, right?

202
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,270
It's not very healthy, but that's a sacrifice you'll have to make.

203
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,510
At this rate, I won't be getting any sleep either.

204
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,610
Gin-chan!

205
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,140
Man, you stink!

206
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,160
Stay away! Go take a bath!

207
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,710
Thanks, Gin-chan!

208
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,900
Gin-chan...

209
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,400
Hey, Gin-chan...

210
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,280
[Note: Kagura is using the Lamaze method of breathing for expectant mothers.]

211
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,380
What are you doing?

212
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,530
I don't feel like sleeping at all.

213
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,080
I took a bath,

214
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,710
but I'm having trouble breathing so I can't fall asleep!

215
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,540
Who told you to eat so much that you'd start breathing with your diaphragm?!

216
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,490
Of course you can't fall asleep when your stomach's that full!

217
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,690
But...

218
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,270
You made all that food...

219
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,390
The rest of that was for breakfast!

220
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,680
Why did you eat my share, stupid brat?!

221
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,090
It's no use...

222
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,770
I'm in so much pain I can't even turn over...

223
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:56,790
[Note: "Shape Up Ran" was a JUMP manga from the 80s.]

224
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,300
I'll go run myself into shape...

225
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,550
By taking a run.

226
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,780
Who told you to be witty?!

227
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,790
Cut it out!

228
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,230
That'll just put us back where we started!

229
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,580
Ah...

230
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,730
Fine.

231
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,070
You don't have to work tomorrow.

232
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,900
Shinpachi and I can handle it.

233
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,330
So don't force yourself to sleep.

234
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,700
Just let me sleep, okay?

235
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,680
No!

236
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,710
Staying up late is bad for my skin!

237
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,130
Someone whose stomach is sticking all the way out shouldn't be talking about skin care!

238
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,230
Come on.

239
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,280
It's already 4:00.

240
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,590
I have to wake up at 7:00 tomorrow.

241
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,840
That's in three hours.

242
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,200
That'd even make Napoleon bitch at his mom in the morning!

243
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,760
He'd probably whine about the quality of the miso soup!

244
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,890
"The word eggplant is not in my dictionary."

245
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,080
Fine.

246
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,570
I'll stop making a fuss.

247
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,000
I won't bother you anymore.

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,980
You already fed me.

249
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,330
But if it's too quiet, I start thinking about stuff.

250
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,630
Can I turn on the radio?

251
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,760
If you keep the volume down.

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,780
Young Night Train!

253
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,670
So let's get started!

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,060
This is DJ Junnijiro, who just had a kidney stone removed,

255
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,050
with stories that make you cry within three minutes!

256
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,500
Young Night Train!

257
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,020
So let's get started!

258
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,890
This is DJ Junnijiro with stories that make you cry within three minutes!

259
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,680
Allow me to introduce the first letter.

260
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,670
This letter is from Radio Name Tom.

261
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,020
[Note: From Tom and Jerry.]

262
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,290
"Sorry, Jerry."

263
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,210
I will never forget about the first friend I ever had.

264
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,260
It happened during summer ten years ago.

265
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,260
I was a shy and quiet child who always played by myself.

266
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,270
So my father brought me a friend.

267
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,330
That was Jerry.

268
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,960
Jerry and I were always together.

269
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,740
We went everywhere together.

270
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,290
We did everything together.

271
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,260
Just like real friends.

272
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,750
I taught him many tricks.

273
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,120
Wait!

274
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,020
Jerry's best trick was to wait.

275
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,790
He would wait as long as I told him,

276
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,070
even when a feast was placed before him.

277
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,260
I didn't need any friends besides Jerry.

278
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,450
That's how I felt at the time.

279
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
But on the other hand,

280
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,750
an increasing number of children showed up who were interested in Jerry.

281
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,400
The next thing I knew, I'd made lots of friends besides Jerry.

282
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,710
Wait.

283
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,360
It didn't take very long for my interest to shift from Jerry to other things.

284
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,790
Jerry longed to play with me the way we used to.

285
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,760
Jerry would bark at me.

286
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,290
That was when his best trick would come in handy.

287
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,150
I would say one word to Jerry.

288
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,650
"Wait."

289
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,420
Jerry would always wait there for my return.

290
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,630
Without moving an inch.

291
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,170
He just waited for me to return.

292
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,230
By chance, my father's store went out of business,

293
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,650
and my affluent family fell to ruin.

294
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,050
Chased by debtors,

295
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,390
we were forced to escape with only the clothes on our backs.

296
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,300
Though I was only a child,

297
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,870
I was still able to understand what must be abandoned in that situation.

298
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,790
Perhaps he realized his own fate.

299
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,560
Jerry chased after me without pause.

300
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,740
Wait!

301
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,230
I delivered the usual word in a cold voice.

302
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,940
Wait.

303
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,560
I left Jerry behind without ever looking back.

304
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,230
A few months later, I returned to that spot.

305
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,370
I had already moved to a faraway city,

306
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,650
but I couldn't stop thinking about Jerry.

307
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,340
Jerry had to be fine.

308
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,620
Somebody must have taken him in.

309
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,730
In retrospect, I probably wanted peace of mind.

310
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,510
I wanted to see Jerry alive as soon as I could,

311
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,750
so I wouldn't have to feel guilty.

312
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,630
Jerry hadn't become someone else's pet or a rotting corpse.

313
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,490
Jerry was waiting as always.

314
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,970
Without moving a step.

315
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,200
Waiting for my return.

316
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,420
Sad, isn't it?

317
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,080
He was abandoned there a while back.

318
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,130
Kind people would try to take him with them,

319
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,800
or feed him or the like.

320
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,800
But this boy refused to budge at all.

321
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,900
In time, people stopped paying attention to him.

322
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,630
He couldn't have expected his owner to return.

323
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,100
Either way, it's a sad story.

324
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,050
I reached out to softly pat his head,

325
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,590
and his eyelids slowly parted to look up at me.

326
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,020
Jerry's tail wagged ever so slightly.

327
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,160
And then, he never moved again.

328
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,150
Little lady...

329
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,620
I see, you were his owner.

330
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,360
Jerry was waiting for me to come back!

331
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,250
Waiting the whole time...

332
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,660
The whole time...

333
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,620
Jerry!

334
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,380
How can I apologize to you?!

335
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,640
How many times do I need to apologize to you?!

336
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,680
You gave me so much!

337
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,060
You taught me how to shed my loneliness when I was all alone!

338
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,320
You opened up the world to me!

339
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,280
You were my first friend!

340
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,420
And yet...

341
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,620
I...

342
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,010
I did...

343
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,030
I did such a terrible thing to my precious friend!

344
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,720
There's no need to apologize.

345
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,410
He was always waiting for you.

346
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,840
And you came.

347
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,890
What else did he need?

348
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,880
He must have been happy to meet his owner in the end.

349
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,380
That's not true! He must hate me!

350
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,330
Because I was the one who caused Jerry's death!

351
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,710
Jerry isn't dead.

352
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,280
He's still alive.

353
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,380
Where?!

354
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,040
Where is he?!

355
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,560
Of course...

356
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,360
Right behind you!

357
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,360
What is this?

358
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,880
What kind of story is this?

359
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,800
Why did a touching story turn into a scary story at the end?!

360
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,630
How would this make people cry?!

361
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,540
More like cry out in terror!

362
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,730
I can't sleep after hearing such a crazy story!

363
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,860
The station must be getting barraged by complaints right now!

364
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,190
That really caught me off guard.

365
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,170
Not that I was scared or anything.

366
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,340
Hey, Kagura!

367
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,710
No more radio!

368
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,810
I can't listen to this...

369
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,440
H-Huh? She fell asleep.

370
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,740
R-Really...

371
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,620
She finally fell asleep?

372
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,600
Way to cause so much trouble.

373
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,140
That's a relief...

374
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,990
Now I can sleep in peace.

375
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,060
Then I'll go to sleep, too.

376
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,560
Right behind you!

377
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,480
Y-Yeah, right...

378
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,930
Y'know...

379
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,060
That crazy story isn't enough to scare me.

380
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,240
Though it surprised me a bit.

381
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,700
That was just a comedy.

382
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,000
There isn't much of a difference between horror and comedy.

383
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,990
This was totally...

384
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,720
Right behind you!

385
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,110
C-Crap...

386
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm starting to hear things 'cause I didn't get enough sleep.

387
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,770
Hey, now I can't fall asleep...?

388
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,960
Ah. Sorry if I woke you up, Kagura.

389
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,780
Looks like I'm sick.

390
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,310
K-Kagura-chan. You're actually awake, right?

391
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,770
You were wide awake just a second ago.

392
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,890
This isn't funny, seriously.

393
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,480
Kagura-chan?

394
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,820
Hey, are you listening?

395
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,520
You're awake, right?

396
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,070
Awake, right?

397
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,110
Wake up!

398
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,590
Don't mess with me!

399
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,950
How much effort do you think I spent to put you to sleep?!

400
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,420
You just abandon me the second you're done?!

401
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,840
You could at least talk with me a bit!

402
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,360
You could at least come with me when I go to take a piss!

403
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,100
Are you going to keep pretending to sleep?

404
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,560
I'll beat you awake...

405
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,920
Okay, that's good.

406
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,770
Bring it on!

407
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,780
Like you're ready to die!

408
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,090
If you're gonna hit me, you had better knock me out!

409
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,650
No, really...

410
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,940
Please knock me out!

411
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,930
Somebody put me to sleep!

412
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,260
Kyu-chan, happy **th birthday.

413
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,180
The next episode...

414
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,370
"That Person Looks Different From Usual During A Birthday Party."

415
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,090
[Tojo gathered everyone together to throw a surprise birthday party for Kyubei.]

416
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,960
[The truth is the characters in this show don't actually age, so just let us stick with "**th."]

417
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,060
[See you next time.]
