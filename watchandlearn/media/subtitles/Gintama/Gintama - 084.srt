Do you know the origin of the word "hard-boiled"?

00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,770
It comes from hard-boiled eggs. Right, the moon tonight looks hard-boiled.

Why would "hard-boiled" refer to something other than hard-boiled eggs?

And you Heiji have been chasing him for ten years and still can't capture him.

155
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
It's all your fault.

156
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,520
If you had caught him, there wouldn't have been any more victims.

157
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,380
If you had caught him, the fox wouldn't have turned so bad.

158
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:30,140
You're the real criminal! I should arrest you for being so useless.

159
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,130
You were suspended. Well, we're sorry.

160
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,620
It's because we invited you into our shop and put you in that situation.

161
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,010
But you also made the mistake of thinking that we were criminals.

162
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,590
So I guess we're even now. We did our job, anyway.

163
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,010
The Odd Jobs... You'll do anything as long as you get paid...

164
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,230
It's a job far from those who are hard-boiled.

165
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,340
What? Do you really look down on us that much?

166
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,390
I can't believe I'd...

167
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,910
I'm not depressed. It happens all the time. So many things happen in life.

168
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,170
It doesn't matter if good things... or bad things happen.

169
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:57,890
Either way, I have a glass of Camus... Nothing changes my day.

170
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,200
Camus... The man's...

171
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,250
That's enough. It's so annoying.

172
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,180
What did you do, bastard?! My hard-boiled...!

173
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,170
That's enough. You repetitive hard-headed fool.

174
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,270
Hard-headed?! It can't be helped since it's hard-boiled!

175
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,550
Your brain is so full of hard-boiled nonsense you can't work.

176
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,550
So quit being so hard-boiled! You idiot!

177
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,920
Mother?!

178
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,200
That way, both you and hard-boiled will be happy!

179
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,010
No, no! I can handle it! I can have it both ways, hard boiled and working.

180
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,120
Well, you already failed at being both hard-boiled and hard working...

181
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,800
Sir...

182
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,530
...you'd better stop now, or your wife will get upset again.

183
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,940
Don't bring complaints about work back home. That's how a man acts.

184
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,770
He's doing it again.

185
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,510
You have to be cool in front of your wife.

186
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,630
That's the key to couples living in harmony.

187
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,060
That's why I'm having Camus today to rejuvenate myself.

188
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,530
This guy just wants to say "Camus" all the time.

189
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,520
He thinks he's hard-boiled whenever he says "Camus."

190
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,060
All things aside, I'm surprised that he even has a family.

191
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,010
It's said that you can't judge people by their appearance.

192
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,470
No, it's the opposite. In this guy's case, he's messed up inside.

193
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,980
Even though I didn't say a word, it broke my heart... Camus...

194
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,490
Speak normally!

195
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,210
Sometimes you can make your wife happy just by sharing your problems and listening

196
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,630
to what she has to say. That's the way couples stay in harmony.

197
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,450
I bet you failed to capture the fox again, right?

198
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,470
Humph.

199
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,590
Really, this master is too wise for me.

200
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,180
He already knew so much about me.

201
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,730
Think about it, we've known each other for over 10 years, Camus.

202
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,860
He said "Camus" again. He's really pushing himself to be hard-boiled.

203
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,130
It's like he's my real dad. I guess he probably feels the same, too.

204
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,680
No, I don't.

205
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,130
Drop dead old man. Camus.

206
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,280
He can't be considered hard-boiled anymore.

207
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:00,480
By the way, the fox made his first appearance in Edo about ten years ago.

208
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,510
Well, you've been trying to capture him since then.

209
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,090
That means I've been hearing your complaints for ten years.

210
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,670
The fox has changed a lot over the years, too.

211
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,100
The elusive criminal and legendary thief-Chogoro the Foxfire.

212
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,600
There was a time when he didn't kill,

213
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:30,000
just stealing riches and giving them to the poor so that he could earn respect.

214
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,510
However, he became a wicked man who stole anything and killed anyone.

215
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,370
But he used to be a thief, so he wasn't really a good guy anyways.

216
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,020
...He's not like that.

217
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm pretty surprised I actually said something like that on the fly.

218
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,640
You liar! You look pretty calm.

219
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,710
The thief... I can't believe I'm supporting the enemy I've been chasing for over ten years, Camus.

220
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:10,330
But as his enemy... or as his rival... we've had so many fights.

221
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,930
That's why I can see something like this.

222
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,110
Men are creatures who understand each other only after fighting it out with their fists.

223
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,550
What kind of flashback is that? It's not even fighting!

224
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,440
It's so one-sided, with you taking all the hits. That's your wish?!

225
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,480
That was...not the fox I knew...

226
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:35,690
A guy who doesn't live by his own rules is useless, regardless of whether he's good or bad.

227
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,770
You're the useless one.

228
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:48,190
I don't know if he's bad or good, but the fox I knew at least lived by his own rules.

229
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:59,430
[Thanks for the food.]

230
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:54,290
He's like a mischievous guy who sneaks into a house, leaving a piece of fried tofu and a thank-you note.

231
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,930
Although he was a thief, he had a sense of humor. He was really cool.

232
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,270
There's no way that kind of guy would kill people.

233
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,520
Boss!

234
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,030
Haji, what's the matter?

235
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,630
Something terrible has happened! Look at this!

236
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,840
This is...

237
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,650
[MY NEXT TARGET WILL BE THE GOLDEN FRIED TOFU STATUE AT OEDO MUSEUM. TRY TO STOP ME, IF YOU CAN. TO THE BAKUFU GOVERNMENT.]
[Note: In Japanese mythology, fried tofu is a favorite food of the fox.]

238
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,650
...A letter foretelling a crime?!

239
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,890
This was found in a house the fox snuck into tonight.

240
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,350
He completely underestimated us.

241
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,460
If we can't catch him after he distributes a message like this, we'll...

242
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,960
That bastard! How could he do something so hard-boiled?!

243
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,440
Wait.

244
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Are you certain you want to violate your suspension just to clear your enemy's name?

245
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,710
It's not something like that.

246
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,590
I just...I just have my own style.

247
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,560
I'll destroy that rotten egg with my jutte!

248
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,320
That's my way of being hard-boiled!

249
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,450
Sir, you didn't pay the bill yet.

250
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,170
Oh, sorry about that.

251
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,080
He's not very cool.

252
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,430
And he's using only small change to pay.

253
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,300
What kind of hard-boiled person is he?

254
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,380
In case you don't return, I charged all your bills.

255
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,210
Hey, old man, you're really hard-boiled! He's so callous.

256
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,640
Good night, Master.

257
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,080
I told you not to call me master.

258
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,240
Well... Then I'll give all of these to you, sir.

259
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,210
Ah, what's this, old geezer?

260
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,490
Sir, you just said you're an Odd Jobs man and that you'll do anything.

261
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:35,610
I already told you that I've been hearing that man's complaints for ten years.

262
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,940
A fox or a racoon...

263
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:46,190
I'm getting sick of it. I'd rather not hear it anymore. I just want him to finish it.

264
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,170
Please help, Mr. Kozenigata.

265
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,270
Hard-boiled! It's the real thing!

266
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,910
He's the embodiment of hard-boiled!

267
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,380
I can't stand this anymore! Master is the best hard-boiled man, after all!

268
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,220
Don't call me master, I'm just an old man.

269
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,160
Hard-boiled?! You're hard-boiled! Was that hard-boiled?

270
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,240
As I said, you're using hard-boiled too many times,

271
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,310
so I'm getting confused about what it actually means!

272
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,030
Hard-boiled!

273
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,480
...Camus.

274
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,020
You're really insistent!

275
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,180
There's so much security.

276
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,380
Of course! Because the Magistrate's reputation is on the line.

277
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,880
We need to sneak in there and capture the fox before them.

278
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,060
But that'll make us look like thieves.

279
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,710
Don't worry about it. I'll guide you.

280
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:48,640
Most undercover agent teams consist of ex-convicts.

281
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,790
You need a thief to catch a thief.

282
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,440
And that is what I used to be.

283
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,620
So, I'm really good at this stuff.

284
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,270
That's what I'm so worried about!
Somebody get this kid outta here!

285
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,310
Hey, don't make so much noise!

286
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,240
What are we going to do if the security guards discover us?

287
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,460
What are you doing?!

288
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,760
At a time like this, you should give up being hard-boiled!

289
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,220
Are you an idiot? Really an idiot?

290
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,730
Idiot! This bike was abandoned.

291
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,150
A hard-boiled man always encounters a hard-boiled bike.

292
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:28,670
[Note: Taka is from the detective drama TV series, Abunai Deka (Dangerous Cops).]

293
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,370
In Abunai Deka, Taka always picks up an abandoned bike on the street and chases the criminals, you know.

294
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,670
Well, Taka is sort of hard-boiled...

295
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,730
You're seriously deranged!

296
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,470
This is really dangerous so get out of the way!

297
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,340
Everyone stay away from this detective!

298
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,940
All right. I have to get off, right?

299
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,020
Hey! I'm getting tired of pointing that out!

300
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,770
How much hard-boiled equipment are you carrying?

301
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,220
Why are you in a bathrobe?!

302
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,930
You look like a hard-boiled man who is done for the day!

303
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,180
[Note: Kagura is singing "Cat's Eye" by Anri in the background.]

304
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,180
Taka said that he wears a bathrobe to work.

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,510
You! Whatever. Stop trying to be like Taka!

306
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,560
Geez, take it off.

307
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,220
Huh? Take this off?

308
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,100
Just take it off. It pisses me off when I see it.

309
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,400
Change into tights.

310
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,030
No, tights won't do. They'll bulge.

311
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,180
It's all right. Cobra in Space Cobra wore them and he bulged, too.

312
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,180
[Note: Space Cobra is a TV anime based on the Cobra manga in JUMP.]

313
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,950
But where can I change?

314
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,700
Um... This kind of place doesn't look very...

315
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,850
What are you, a little girl?!
You're a man, aren't you?!

316
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,990
Aren't you a hard-boiled man?!

317
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,410
Because I'm hard-boiled, I have to struggle to do the right thing.

318
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,600
As a hard-boiled man, I can't change like mere kids...

319
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,040
I already told you to stop doing that! That's enough!

320
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,970
Hey, Kagura, give him another one. You...

321
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,450
Here I come!

322
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,230
The suspect! There's the suspect!

323
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,780
Good, the diversion plan worked like a charm.

324
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,850
You liar!

325
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,410
Use this opportunity to sneak in from the back.

326
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,530
Don't let Kagura's death go to waste!

327
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:29,430
[Preview]

328
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,290
The next episode...

329
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,880
Hey, what about Part B?! Didn't the eyecatch just air?!

330
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,030
We'll see you next week!

331
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,430
It's because you took up all that time before Part A!

332
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,000
The next episode... "Hard-Boiled Eggs Don't Crack," Camus.

Mitsumeru Cat's eye

334
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,630
Magic play is dancing.

335
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,420
Midori iro ni hikaru

336
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,480
Mitsumeru Cat's eye

337
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,030
Magic play is dancing...

338
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,740
[Chogoro the Foxfire's next target is the Golden Fried Tofu Statue.]
