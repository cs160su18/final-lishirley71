Sadaharu looks awfully huge.

Hey, Shinpachi, get your head out of there and bring me my strawberry milk.

12

14

Sadaharu! Sadaharu turned giant overnight!

Don't bother me with that.

16

Just a few days passed since I last saw him. Men and dogs hit growth spurts all the time.

Sadaharu loves strawberry milk.

22
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,190
He's gotten bigger, but his personality hasn't changed.

23
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,850
But how in the world did he become like this?

24
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,010
It's because you blindly gave him too much calcium.

25
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,170
Don't underestimate calcium. Taking calcium makes everything better.

26
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,460
And yet, you're still as stupid as ever.

27

More importantly, though, what are we going to do? He's gotten so huge.

28
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,950
It'll be fine, Shinpachi-kun. For times like these...

Where'd you pick up such a convenient device?!

32
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,790
Yesterday at the bar, I traded my edamame with the guy sitting next to me.

33
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,320
That's 100 percent suspicious!

34
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,150
For now, we might be able to learn why he grew so huge and how to reverse it.

35
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,320
Sadaharu, how did you get so big?

Seems she left him after all. I always knew they would break up.

70

Difference in values, my foot. It's a difference in values is what make marriage interesting.

Everyone.

158
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,160
Please be quiet. I will explain everything at the studio.

159
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,430
Damn you! Why're you selling out your friends?

160
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,490
Look at them! This is what kind of people they are!

161
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,370
Are you rolling tape? Did you get that?

162
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,800
Shit! We're not getting anywhere like this, Gin-san! If this continues, Sadaharu will be...

163
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,230
Rock-a-bye-baby...

164
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,220
Go to sleep...

165
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:48,030
You've been good reporters...fall asleep...

166
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,030
All of a sudden, I feel sleepy...

167
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,860
Hey, hey, what's going on?

168
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,790
Whoa! What's this? Sadaharu? It's a mini Sadaharu!

169
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,300
How unusual. Komako never acts friendly towards anyone but us.

170
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,710
How do you do?

171
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,590
We are the lovely miko sisters, Ane and Mone.

172
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,150
We are the ones who entrusted that huge dog with you.

173
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,030
You there, monster, stop!

174
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,030
Do you know how fast you're walking that dog? Stop right now!

175
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,390
Does it look like I'm walking my dog?

176
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,880
I'd have stopped a long time ago, if I could.

177
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,580
You really are an idiot, aren't you? Big idiot!

178
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,520
Okay, we'll arrest you for obstruction of justice. You hurt a police officer's feelings.

179
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,340
You're an idiot! A real idiot!

180
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,260
Then you leave me no choice. I'll stop you by force.

181
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,200
Don't do it!

182
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,250
Bye bye.

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,360
You're the one that goes bye-bye!

184
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,070
That was close.

185
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,180
What?!

186
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,190
Hey! Let go, you sadist!

187
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,620
You're the sadist.

188
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,310
Hey, Sogo.

189
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,040
Look out!

190
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,610
Hijikata-san?

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,180
Fire!

192
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,820
Hijikata, you bastard!

193
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,090
Things are really getting out of hand, Gin-san.

194
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,780
Don't worry, Shinpachi.

195
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,450
We're just good citizens, who took care of an abandoned dog. We've done nothing wrong.

196
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,760
The Dog Deity is a servant of the gods...

197
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,380
[Note: Koryumon = Golden Dragon Gate Ryuketsu = Dragon Hole]

198
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,800
A guardian deity of the Koryumon,

199
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,380
the very largest of the Ryuketsu, holes from which all the chi on Earth spews forth...

200
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,180
Hey, why'd you show up out of nowhere and start talking all this nonsense?

201
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,410
You can talk about komon somewhere else.

202
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,160
[Note: a word play on the similarity between Koryumon = golden dragon gate and komon = anus/butt hole]

203
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,160
No one's talking about such a thing!

204
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,820
We are the shrine miko who have guarded the Koryumon for generations.

205
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,970
But the Amanto drove us away and built the Terminal over the Koryumon.

206
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,930
So, we lost our jobs, and in order to earn a living, were forced to give up being shrine maidens.

207
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,690
You dumped your sacred charge because you were broke?

208
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,140
We had no choice! We were dirt poor!

209
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,070
But why did he turn into that all of a sudden?

210
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:16,570
The Inugami is a docile creature, but once it's strength is unleashed, it transforms into the horrific Jyushin.

211
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:16,570
[Note: Inugami means Dog God. And Jyushin is a Beast God.]

212
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,500
But it's hard to believe it was awakened without doing the ceremony.

213
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,340
Ceremony?

214
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:27,220
A crimson fruit and the blood of a mountain goat shall release the power of Kamiko.

215
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:27,220
[Note: Kamiko means "God Child" and is probably Sadaharu's real name.]

216
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,320
A crimson fruit and blood of a mountain goat?

217
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,420
"Blood of a mountain goat" refers to the liquid that comes out of breasts. In other words, milk.

218
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,340
"Fruit" means... You were feeding him strawberries, weren't you? Cheap, nearly rotten, ones.

219
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,640
Strawberries, and...

220
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,770
Milk...

221
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,490
Strawberries...

222
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,330
Milk...

223
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,570
Strawberry milk!

224
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,670
I'll give you strawberry milk! So please just calm down!

225
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,050
The evil giant dog has climbed on top of O-Edo Dome.

226
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:02,290
Today's scheduled Aliens versus Yakuza game will be cancelled. The fans are furious.

227
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,320
Hijikata, die!

228
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,660
Huh? Those aren't fans.

229
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,660
You're the one who'll die!

230
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,030
That aside, the giant dog's owners will be responsible for the huge losses

231
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,430
resulting from the cancellation of today's game.

232
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,380
This is crazy! We can't have him causing any more damage!

233
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,000
All the money I saved by working at the hostess club!

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,340
I'm going to lose the house my sugar daddy bought me!

235
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Gin-chan!

236
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,140
Sadaharu!

237
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,250
Listen to me. Until we complete the incantation to undo his transformation,

238
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,030
you need to buy us some time.

239
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,550
One minute... One minute is all we need.

240
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,780
Gin-chan!

241
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,260
Don't hurt him... Don't hurt Sadaharu!

242
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,220
Sadaharu is suffering!

243
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,290
Say you'll help him!

244
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,550
Don't be too easy on him. Attack as if you were trying to kill him,

245
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,300
or else, he'll kill you.

246
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,640
No way, no way, no freakin' way! One minute? I won't last ten seconds! Come on!

247
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,970
No one told me about this!

248
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,310
Who are those people?! Those sisters are totally self-absorbed!

249
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,540
Hey, are they really chanting the incantation?! Looks awfully random to me!

250
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,390
Don't talk to us! Now we have to start over from the beginning!

251
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,200
Uh-oh, how did the beginning go again? I forgot. Nanmaida...? Nope.

252
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,200
[Nanmaida is short for Namu Amida Butsu...]

253
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,240
Shinpachi!

254
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,440
Gin-san!

255
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,550
Sadaharu...

256
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,200
enough of this!

257
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,220
Gin-chan! Stop!

258
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,400
Sadaha...

259
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,370
Gi--!

260
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,320
Gin-chan!

261
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,400
Damn... now I'm seeing things!

262
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Look out!

263
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,140
Gin-san!

264
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,750
Hey! You interrupted the incantation again...

265
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,350
Damn you two! We have an emergency!

266
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,100
This is no time to play some stupid party game!

267
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,300
What? What are you trying to say? Don't tell me you can't get that flute out?

268
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,570
Which is it? "Yes" or "No"?

269
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm asking you which!

270
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,400
There it is!

271
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,690
On no, we forgot those two!

272
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,900
Mone.

273
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,450
They can run like that?!

274
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,410
Gross! They look like some new freaky animal!

275
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,800
But they're only exchanging carbon dioxide. They're going to suffocate each other!!

276
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,720
They're barely breathing. They're already barely breathing.

277
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,410
Clench your teeth!

278
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,530
It came out!

279
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,440
So did my teeth! Why'd you tell me to clench my teeth!

280
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,400
Don't worry about it. They'll grow back.

281
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,740
Hey, what're you going to do now? The flute's broken!

282
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,150
Komako!

283
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,300
Now that it's come to this, our only chance is to awaken Komako and pit her against Sadaharu!

284
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,240
Mone!

285
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,910
Onmakayashabazarasatoba!

286
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,020
Awaken! Inugami!

287
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,470
Tiny! What's with this?! Now it's a runt with a scary face!

288
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,500
Komako is the Inugami of Protection! She won't be fazed by minor problems!

289
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,550
Is that a force field?!

290
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,550
Now! Quickly!

291
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,950
Now you all have to play catch with me.

292
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,320
Play catch?!

293
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,580
This ball is loaded with the power of genriki.

294
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,580
[Note: Genriki are powers attained through ascetic practices]

295
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,900
By throwing this to each other and tracing a five-pointed star,

296
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,790
we can lay a huge magical formation on this field.

297
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,240
The five-pointed star represents the relationships between

298
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,580
Yin, Yang and the five natural elements.

299
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,570
It's a powerful charm that cleanses calamity from all things in the Universe.

300
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,720
And, if we can seal him inside, it may revert the awakening of the Inugami.

301
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,580
Teacher, your lecture put Kagura-san to sleep.

302
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,680
The one problem is that we'll have to trap him.

303
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,170
So that means, we'll have to surround Sadaharu and

304
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,740
create a five-pointed star while withstanding his attacks? That's impossible!

305
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,700
But if it's the only way to save Sadaharu, we'll do it.

306
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,950
So, what is "play catch"?

307
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,430
We're all going to die...

308
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,910
This is no time to bicker! Everyone, take your positions!

309
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,710
Okay! Play ball!!

310
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,050
Hey! Where're you throwing?!

311
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,660
If you drop the ball, the spell will be useless!

312
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,520
You absolutely must not drop it!

313
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,540
Now you tell me!

314
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,400
I got it!

315
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,400
Shinpachi! I always knew you were a kid who could do it if he tried!

316
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,080
Mone, catch!

317
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,110
What're you doing, damn you!

318
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,680
Make it! Make it!

319
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Get over there! Over there!

320
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,290
Gin-chan, way to go.

321
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,310
Heads up, Kagura!

322
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,260
Shinpachi! What're you doing over there?!

323
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,340
It's no use. I can't get to it!

324
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,270
She kicked it!

325
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,040
It's heading to the fifth player!

326
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,740
Huh? Aren't you the fifth player?

327
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,650
Was I?

328
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,870
Nobody's there!

329
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,510
Mone?!

330
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,710
You can't! There's no way you can handle such a mean fastball! Get out of the way!

331
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,540
Big sister... We can't quit now. We have to finish this.

332
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,520
We're the ones who let that puppy become a monster.

333
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,440
Whatever the reason, we neglected our responsibility.

334
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:28,390
But these people never abandoned him no matter what he turned into.

335
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,170
They cared for and protected him as a member of their family.

336
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,840
It may be too late, but I want to become a member of that puppy's family.

337
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,290
That's why I won't run away anymore!

338
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,380
I will accept all my responsibilities in these hands.

339
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,990
I will accept that puppy with these hands...

340
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,090
And it still hits you in the face!

341
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,650
Ack... The ball...

342
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,200
It's hopeless!

343
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,740
It's no use. There's no time!

344
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,630
You did well.

345
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,460
Leave the rest to me.

346
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,010
Sadaharu!

347
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,170
Snap out of it!

348
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,730
What is that?

349
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,830
A strange light emanating from the ground...

350
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,240
Ack! Look!

351
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,510
Sadaharu!

352
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,720
Sadaharu!!

353
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,060
I'm so glad... so glad you're safe!

354
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,130
Ahh...seeing her cry so happily.

355
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,640
They really are a family.

356
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,370
Although... it's probably over now.

357
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,260
There's no way they'll let him stay after this happened.

358
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,720
Big Sister... Do we have any right to say anything after what happened?

359
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,650
I know. I'm not such a shameless woman...

360
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,630
You guys do whatever you want. If you don't want him, we'll take him home with us.

361
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,280
You don't have to worry. We won't abandon him ever again.

362
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,880
I make quite a lot these days at the hostess bar.

363
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,220
That's so stupid. After all we've been through, don't talk to us like that.

364
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,160
You should know better. Sadaharu is...

365
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,100
Stupid show. Why did they pixellate the faces?

366
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,630
You still haven't thrown away this piece of junk?

367
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,870
Gin-san, hurry up or we'll leave without you.

368
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,140
Coming.

369
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,350
Hey, did you bring it?

370
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,750
The poop bags. Inconsiderate owners...

371
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,450
have no right to keep a pet.

372
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,930
Don't bark at me.

373
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,870
You sure caused us a lot of trouble.

374
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,730
[Thank you.]

375
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,160
The next episode... "Adults Only. We Wouldn't Want Anyone Immature in Here."

376
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:41,160
[After incurring huge debts in the Sadaharu fiasco, Ane gets a job working at the same hostess bar Otae works at.]

377
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,100
