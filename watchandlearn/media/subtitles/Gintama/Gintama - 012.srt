I'm sick and tired of hearing that.

It's just "You're looking beautiful...as usual."

I can't do it. My mouth is saying "No, no, no!"

In a roundabout way, you're saying it doesn't taste good.

For guys who can't wipe their own backsides, helping other people is ludicrous.

Yes.

Calm down.

106
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,050
How apathetic can you be?!

107
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,360
You can't even decide to run away,

Aw, shut up!

Once you've come of age, it isn't your parents' fault anymore.

112

Do something about it yourself.

You haven't done anything about the rent!

114

Pipe down.

115

She's good with the customers, and does a good job.

127

It's no big deal at all.

128
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,660
That's impressive.

129
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,110
And she even has a great sense of humor.

130

Oh? Really?

131

Of course not.

Well, there may be difficult moments, tough moments and unbearable moments,

Thank you very much.

You might think things are difficult now,

139

but in the future, it's gonna get a lot worse.

Shut up.

Then why don't you just go home!

150
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,600
You probably have food there.

151
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,910
My sister is home today.

152
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,410
My sister's there, cooking.

Shin, today we're having fried egg

and fried egg and fried egg.

155
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,710
Sis's fried eggs make me see things I'm not supposed to see.

156
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,350
Did you know, Gin?

157
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,370
A kind of canned herring called Surströmming

158
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,150
has a smell that even cats run away from.

159
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,740
They say smelly things taste good.

160
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,800
Gin, did you know?

161
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,190
The Inuit people, after killing a caribou,

162
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,890
apparently eat even the gunky contents of the stomach.

163
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,700
It must be warm and delicious.

164
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,160
Gin, did you know?

165
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,870
When an owl catches a baby mouse,

166
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,500
it feeds it to fatten it in its nest before eating it.

167
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,190
It must be plump and juicy for sure.

168
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,910
There are so many delicious things in the world.

169
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,110
When I think about it, the rent here isn't all that low, is it?

170
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,370
There must be a ton of other places that are cheaper than this.

171
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,300
You know, Gin...

172
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,710
What the?!

173
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,030
Our emergency funds!

174
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,020
That borderline-diabetic rat bastard!

175
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:47,520
I thought I got into a really great company!

176
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,550
At that time anyway.

177
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,580
Huh? Where're my cigarettes?

178
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,340
Oh come now. You just sent Catherine out to buy some.

179
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,280
What? Did I?

180
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,430
Yes, you did. You're too much.

181
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,440
She sure is taking long, though. How far did that girl go?

182
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,750
Hey.

183
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,420
On an errand? That old hag is a real taskmaster.

184
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,620
Y-Yes, I am. I came to buy Mu's cigarettes...

185
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,390
I see.

186
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

187
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,600
Anyway, this area is

188
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,370
like a garbage dump where the trash piles up.

189
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,250
What I want to say is...

190
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,820
the two of us are alike, we're both trash.

191
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,750
No, trash isn't the right word.

192
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,420
We're both boogers in the same nostril.

193
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,720
In the same pot...pan...spoon.

194
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,880
I understand.

195
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,980
You're a good person. All of you are good people.

196
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,640
You both from around here?

197
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,180
What's it to you?

198
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,570
Have a look.

199
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,890
So?

200
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,570
Can I get you to cooperate with an investigation?

201
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,710
Is this everyone?

202
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,750
Did something happen?

203
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,840
Yes, there have been

204
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,930
several robberies in the vicinity.

205
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,830
Sixteen since the start of this month.

206
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,540
That's pretty troubling.

207
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,040
Says the thief who stole the money!

208
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,470
It's obvious by that sweet breath of yours?

209
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,000
The perp appears to be an Amanto.

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,750
It's still under investigation.

211
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,290
I thought you might have heard any disturbing rumors.

212
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,880
In that case, I have heard one.

213
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,820
She's your suspect.

214
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,640
What the hell did you do that for?!

215
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,890
Man who makes bad jokes get finger broken.

216
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,210
Never heard of that!

217
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,630
I was just trying to show you a way to return to your hometown for free.

218
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,980
Deportation isn't free.

219
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,620
No sir, I'd be returning home in disgrace.

220
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,230
You're in no position to be choosy!

221
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,830
Worst comes to worst, I'll just hold onto the side of ship and go home like that.

222
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,770
5...4...3...2...1...

223
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,480
No!

224
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,300
Zero!

225
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,340
Did that on the trip here!

226
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,860
I'll manage!

227
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,860
That's a cold calculation.

228
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,470
I'll be fine.

229
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,960
Even if she's thrown out into space, she'll have no problem surviving.

230
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,750
I'm not a cockroach!

231
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,220
How dare you say that!

232
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,590
Apologize to the cockroaches!

233
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,620
Apologize to the cockroaches, the greatest survivors on Earth!

234
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,720
Am I...in the way here?

235
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,440
No way!

236
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,310
Anyway, we don't have the kind of money that someone would steal.

237
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,820
Well, if anything does happen, we'll let you know.

238
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,340
Please do.

239
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,390
The inside of my mouth tastes awful!

240
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,520
I shouldn't drink sweet milk beverages just before going to bed.

241
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,900
Okay, I've taken another step up towards becoming an adult.

242
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,310
But I'm going down the steps.

243
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,930
Why am I doing my own two-man comedy routine?

244
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,450
What? Working overtime?

245
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,320
Couldn't be.

246
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,520
I'm starving.

247
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,580
I'm sooooo sorry!

248
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,120
Forgive me for interrupting your midnight tryst!

249
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,690
I'll disappear. Please enjoy your dazzling world of pleasure!

250
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,230
Hey.

251
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,710
Dopes.

252
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,140
Prostrate yourselves before my power.

253
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,460
You're sleepwalking.

254
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,970
What was that dream? What's it about?

255
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,750
A brandy glass and cat?

256
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,660
How empty a man's life is.

257
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,130
Hey!

258
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,780
So what evil sheriff was that?

259
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,140
Huh?

260
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,190
That looks like my scooter.

261
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,190
You're all good people.

262
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,850
Now that you mention it, the umbrella in the back looks exactly like mine.

263
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,420
That's the bar's cash register!

264
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,720
What the hell are you doing at this hour of the night?

265
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,360
Catherine?!

266
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,960
Bye, rotten old hag.

267
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,910
Moor-ons!

268
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,830
That ugly pig-faced cow!

269
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,800
Tonight, I drink your blood!

270
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,450
Wh-What the?!

271
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,160
Help! Seiya!

272
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,190
Give me a break!

273
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,430
Just a minute. What're you guys doing?

274
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,880
Where are you going?

275
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,400
Waaaaaait!

276
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,790
They're gone.

277
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,380
They drove off! Dammit!

278
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,660
Seiya! I'm scared!

279
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,640
Shut up! Old hag!

280
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,600
What's that?

281
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,860
I hate cats!

282
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,380
Hey! I think we just moved past Catherine in the felony count!

283
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,320
There!

284
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,050
Catherine!

285
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,100
Die!

286
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,900
Cath...er...ine!

287
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,930
Deaaatthhhhh!

288
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,070
What? What?!

289
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,430
Too bad.

290
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,430
I rather liked you.

291
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,910
That part about you supporting your family. Was that a lie, too?

292
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,940
Otose. You're a good person. But you're such a dope.

293
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,060
It's okay to like helping people.

294
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,780
But if you overdo it, bad people like me will take advantage of you.

295
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,350
It's part of my character.  Too late to change.

296
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,850
It's how I got to meet some interesting people.

297
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,500
Want to hear about it?

298
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,170
No, hear me out. It's the least you can do.

299
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,500
There was a man, you see.

300
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,670
It was a cold, snowy day.

301
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,940
On a whim, I went out to visit my late husband's grave.

302
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,900
Hey, Granny!

303
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,090
Mind if I eat those dumplings?

304
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,150
I'm so hungry I'm about to croak.

305
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:01,370
These aren't for me. I gave them to my husband. Ask him.

306
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,640
Oh yeah?

307
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,370
Okay, then...

308
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,240
What did my husband say?

309
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,690
When I asked him, do you know what he said?

310
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,330
Don't know.

311
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,340
I have no interest in the rambling of strangers.

312
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,540
"Dead men don't talk," he said.

313
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,240
"I won't ever forget this debt."

314
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,960
"After all, you're an old lady. Probably going to kick the bucket soon."

315
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:42,760
"But until that happens, I'll watch over her for you," he said.

316
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,250
You're going to watch over me?

317
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,600
Let's see what you can do, then.

318
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,730
Nice way to show her gratitude to you for giving her a job.

319
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,930
People who can't keep their obligations are simply hideous, old hag.

320
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,440
Like someone who lives on the second floor of someone's house without paying rent?

321
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,640
People are all kind of hideous, in a way.

322
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,690
You're talking nonsense.

323
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,170
Thank you for cooperating with our investigation.

324
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,240
You turned out to be quite the stray cat.

325
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,300
Cats are animals that claw at things, though.

326
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,210
You hit the nail on the head.

327
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,290
It's too late for you to change now.

328
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,430
But if you're down and out and need a meal in the future, come by the back of the shop.

329
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,440
I'll let you have some leftovers.

330
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,600
Otose, you're a fool.

331
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,540
However...

332
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,280
It's the first time I've seen you not get angry when someone called you a fool.

333
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,850
I have my moments.

334
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,430
Since you did me a favor today. I'll let you have this month's rent free.

335
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,250
You serious?!

336
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,690
Thanks, granny!

337
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,650
I'll be sure to pay the month after next!

338
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,090
Heck, I'll write off all of the late rent you owe me. And the month after next to boot.

339
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,550
Yippee! Yippee!

340
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,410
Stop trying to act cute.

341
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,830
A light and fleeting act of compassion...

342
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,760
when it touches you, you feel a warmth.

343
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,060
A penetrating, heartfelt song...

344
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:53,380
that warms one's frozen fingertips.

345

347
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,060
While looking for Ham for our client,

348
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,820
we got involved in a tight situation.

349
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,830
"Harusame", the biggest crime syndicate in the galaxy?!

350
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,960
Who do you think you are, Frieza?! Butthead!

The next episode:

352

"If You're Going to Cosplay, Go All Out"
