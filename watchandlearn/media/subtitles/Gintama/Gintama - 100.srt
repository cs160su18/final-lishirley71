we'll show the new opening a little later.]

I've cornered you. There is
nowhere for you to escape.

The game is over, uh-huh.

That's right. Give up peacefully, serial
bombers, Katsurayama, Josephine.

8

Ha ha ha. Ginta, you're the
one who's been cornered.

I've already set bombs everywhere
in this building.

10

If Josephine pushes this switch,
everyone here will die.

There it is! Ginta-san's special weapon!

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,020
It's a very strong skill used to strike
a blow to the opponent's crotch!

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,850
With sixteen strikes a second,
his crotch is already damaged.

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,970
What?!

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,210
I-It doesn't work. Oh, I see. Oh my god!

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,650
Those clothes... Those clothes make it tough
to see exactly where Josephine's crotch is.

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,390
It must be somewhere else.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,350
Dokan.

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,980
Hey, wait.

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,540
This manga is still being serialized?

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,760
Hey, JUMP. Stop it already and
let a rookie try something.

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,350
What's with this manga?!
It's so unreadable.

26
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,500
The drawings are really rough, and
there's too much dialog, Idiot.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,120
They say, "You can read Amachi
Sensei's manga only in JUMP."

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,120
[Note: "You can read XX Sensei's manga only in JUMP."
is a common line used in SHONEN JUMP magazine.]

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,190
That's wrong. "We're forced
to read it in JUMP."

30
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:40,990
[Note: One Park is a parody of One Piece. Belt is a parody of Naruto. Hanger Hanger is a parody of HUNTER x HUNTER which has a habit of taking long hiatuses.]

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,080
I guess it's about time for JUMP to cultivate a
talent who can surpass "One Park" or "Belt."

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,990
"Hanger Hanger" is back again, but we
won't know when it'll take off again.

33
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,020
According to my instincts,

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,980
it's about time for the next genius to appear
in JUMP within the ten-year cycle.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,090
I'd like to hear more.

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,200
What's the problem with "Gintaman"?
I think it's fairly good. I like it.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,800
What's with you, kid?! Are
you a fan of Gintaman?

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,970
You shouldn't read this kind of
manga. It'll stunt your growth.

39
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,610
I'm not a kid, I'm Konishi.

40
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,210
I'm asking you what the problem
is with Gintaman.

41
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,830
It's the editor's fault.

42
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,440
It's the fault of the editor in charge, who
has left the manga unattended until now.

43
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,640
That's how an amateur thinks.

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,810
[Note: New SHONEN JUMP artist manga are often debuted in AKAMARU JUMP. If the manga becomes popular it is serialized in SHONEN JUMP.]

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,810
The editor can only help lead the manga
author's manga into AKAMARU JUMP.

46
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,140
Once it becomes a serialized manga, it's up to
the manga author to survive by vastly improving.

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,120
Even if he can't lead the manga author,

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,630
he should at least be able to stop him
from going in the wrong direction.

49
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,690
I understand that the manga in JUMP
needs to have a lot of energy.

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,040
But when the author goes too far,

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,580
it's the editor's responsibility to nudge
him in the right direction.

52
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,740
Obviously, I should be the editor.

53
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,120
He doesn't know what he's doing.

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,170
I bet the editors of JUMP are all highly educated
guys who've studied a lot of things,

55
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,050
but don't understand the hearts of boys.

Well...the author is very shy around people,
so please don't get all worked up.

147
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,310
And don't mention anything about this manga
possibly being discontinued, either.

148
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,870
I know.

149
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,820
I definitely won't say anything about the reader survey
results, circulation or the manuscript fees.

150
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,020
You sound like you'll talk all about it!

151
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,730
Good morning.

152
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,470
Man, this house is really dirty.
I wonder if he ever cleans up.

153
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,730
Ah, most manga authors are like this.

154
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,450
They stay at home more than the average
person and don't have time to clean up.

155
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,770
Are you serious?

156
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,030
I thought it was common for them to
live in homes with spiral staircases.

157
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,550
Ah, that's just for the
ones at the very top.

158
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,800
Most manga authors' houses look like this.

159
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,070
Ah, thank you for your hard
work, Amachi-kun.

160
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,430
Uho.

161
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,770
Ah, there's poop over there,
so watch your step.

162
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,830
Sakata-san. This is the manga
author, Amachi-kun.

163
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,080
Amachi-kun, today's meeting will be
between the three of us, including Sakata-san.

164
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,110
Uho.

165
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,700
Well, Sakata-san. He's basically
a gorilla, but not a real gorilla.

166
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,030
No, he's a real gorilla.

167
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,430
Most manga authors are like this.
Basically, they're all gorillas.

168
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,810
But Haraki-sensei of "Gyo Gyo's Wonderful Adventure"
is handsome and doesn't grow old.

169
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:26,940
[Note: Gyo Gyo's is a parody of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure by Toshiyuki Araki. Hirohiko is known for his appearance not changing for nearly 20 years.]

170
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,940
He's not a gorilla, but an immortal fairy.

171
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,880
Whatever. Anyway, why don't
you guys sit down over there?

172

Ah, there's poop over there,
so watch your step.

173
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,870
Well, today I'll teach you
about the basics.

174
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,010
Uho.

175
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,190
Well, I've read most of your manga.

176
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,360
It wasn't interesting, so I just skipped a lot
of it, but the storyline is something like this.

177
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,540
In a fictional city called Tokyo,
the smart and refined man,

178
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,630
Ginta-san, with his happy friends
Patsuan and Gurako, run wild!

179
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,310
[Gintaman]

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,310
...That's the basic concept.

181
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,720
Then I'll tell you what.

182
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,310
First, basically, the design for
the main character is crap.

183
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,980
Here, this is Ginta-san.

184
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,680
See, his appearance is too plain.

185
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,330
Really? His name is Ginta, so
we made his hair silver...

186
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,330
[Note: Gin means silver in Japanese.]

187
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,230
Uho.

188
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,060
Fine. Are you guys stupid or something?

189
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,980
The manga is basically black and white.

190
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,820
Why did you use color
to make it stand out?!

191
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,430
Ah, I see. Ah, that's right.

192
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,330
Uho...

193
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,800
Ah! Don't get so disappointed,
Amachi-kun!

194
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,670
Listen. For example, let's make
this Ginta-san a silhouette!

195
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,230
See?! Look at this. There're no special
characteristics at all, are there?

196
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,710
Kids won't remember
a character like this!

197
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,120
If he's not a character you can
identify by his silhouette,

198
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,180
you can't survive in manga for boys.

199
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,070
For example... Can you tell who this is?

200
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,420
Ah! Yes! Yes! Zoffy of One Park!

201

202
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,220
What about this?

203
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,910
Ah! It's Luke of Peth Note!

206
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,840
Jugo of Pleach! That's right!

207

[Note: Parody of Ichigo from Bleach.]

208
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,660
They're all identifiable from
just their silhouettes!

209
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,050
And how about this?

210

[Parody of Goku from Dragon Ball.]

211

Gochu of Dragon Bozu.

212
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,060
Bu bu. That's wrong.

213
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,780
What?! That's Gochu! That's
definitely Gochu!

214
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,560
Uho!

215
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,200
Ah, Amachi-kun, calm down!

216
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,560
The answer is...

217
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,190
...Ginta-san.

218
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,650
To be exact, it's the Ginta-san
from next week on.

219
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,700
Well, if the main character has these attributes,
I think it'll be all right. Yeah...

220
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,780
Amachi, use this starting next week.

221
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,690
U-Uho.

222
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,860
No, wait... Well... That looks
just like... Dragon Bozu's...

223
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,700
Huh? Dragon...what? Stop saying
things that I can't understand.

224
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,600
Ah, no.... Huh? You just said you've been
reading JUMP for twenty years, right?

225
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,530
Anyway, the Gintaman's serialization
is already in its fifth week,

226
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,590
so we can't suddenly change the
visual look of the main character

227
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,020
to something completely
different now, anyway.

228
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,580
You know, you can say his perm failed.

229
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,610
Or he had a perm explosion... Boom!

230
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,310
Uho!

231
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,540
Why does it look like you're
saying, "I'll take that idea!"

232
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,090
We already had something
ridiculous like that before!

233
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,140
All right, we finished the main character,
so next we'll talk about the enemy!

234
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,230
Hey! You're pursuing this
subject all by yourself!

235
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,350
Listen! In order for the main character
to stand out, a strong rival is needed.

236
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,100
[Note: Parody of Shichibukia and The Seven Warlords of the sea from One Piece and Bankai from Bleach and the Akatsuki from Naruto.]

237
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,100
Right... Like One Park's Chichibukai.
Or Belt's "Bakazuki."

238

[BAKAZUKI]

240
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,710
The main character beats his strongest
enemy, so it makes him cool.

241
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,140
And sometimes a strong enemy
winds up becoming a friend,

242
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,500
so he becomes more exciting.

243
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,450
Hmm...

244
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,830
So, Gintaman's rival character is...

245
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,290
This guy? Who's this, anyway?!

246
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,460
It's a detective from the Shinjuku
police station, Dorokata-san.

[DOROKATA]

249
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,540
Sometimes he hunts down Ginta-san
and sometimes he helps him.

250
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,200
It's a character that screams, "closest
rival" but is really a "friend."

251
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,850
I already told you that it's too plain! Can
you identify him by his silhouette?

252
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,400
Don't make me repeat the same
thing so many times.

253

Are you guys stupid or something?

254
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,190
Look at these. In JUMP, these are the
silhouettes of the rival characters.

255
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,670
See, no one looks the same.

256

So you do know all about it, right?

257
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,500
You know about Dragon Bozu, right?

come complaining to us.

to handle it, so don't worry.

carefully, right here.

...it's Ginta-san.

at first, but ends up being a friend.

Then what's the meaning
of this discussion?!

291

Well, it's something like this: He
fights with his rival and wins.

Then they become friends
without knowing it.

he fights and wins again.

join in the JUMP formula!

Namcha!

302

Well, as far as appearances go, "Gintaman"
is more like a comedy manga...

303
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,620
...but as you know, a gag is created
by a funny man and a straight man.

304
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,030
There're some gags where there's only a funny
man and no straight man at all, but...

305
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,750
If that's the case, the reader can be
the straight man while he reads.

306
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,170
Wherever there's laughter,
there's a straight man.

307
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,150
Now you guys understand how important
it is to have a straight man, don't you?

However...

310

this straight man went slightly too far.

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,460
We'll be called in by the
top people again!

454
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,210
I look ugly, so I don't like it, either.

455
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,690
Tsk, it can't be helped then.

456
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,510
I thought it was a great idea, though.

457
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,320
All right, we just have to do
it the regular way, right?

458
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,840
I don't know what "regular" even means.

459
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,140
Then, let's get started again! Here we go.

460
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,120
The GinTama Anime starts its third year!

461
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,610
Huh? Is it over?

462
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:27,740
[Preview]

463
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,390
It's a familiar uniform... and a familiar
stance... But his face is...

464
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,890
What are you doing in a place
like this, Hijikata-kun?

465
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,740
You're...

466
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,080
["Rules Are Made to be Broken"]

467
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,420
[His name is Kamotaro Ito. A feeling
of chaos in the Shinsengumi...]

will start in the next episode!]
