["On A Moonless Night, Insects Are Drawn To The Light"]

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,770
After living a long time in darkness, I perceived a light too faint for the eyes to see.

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,040
I don't recall when I learned that the light radiated from human beings.

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,540
It shines brightest, like a brilliant flower of light, just before they die.

10
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,200
But there are a few who shine just as bright while they're alive.

11
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,080
These lights are extremely unstable...aggressive, and tinged with sad colors.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,490
Knowingly or unknowingly, people are attracted to this light, like moths to a flame.

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,120
But once I saw that light, I could never live in darkness again.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,130
I, too, am a moth. A moth who fears losing his beacon.

15
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,420
A moth, who struggles desperately to avoid being swallowed up by that fiery beacon of light.

16
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,400
Moths guided by that beacon's flame. There are moths everywhere...

17
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,630
But amongst all the bugs, there is an odd one among us.

18
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,730
This one is not a moth.

19
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,780
It's extremely difficult to see, but it emits a very faint light.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,080
It gleams like a sword-a cold steel blade drawn from its sheath.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,760
It's glint is sharp... Silver.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,730
But why is it...

23
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,000
I just can't...

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
stand its color!

25
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,850
Here I thought it was just some random punks barging in to interrupt our work...

26
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,830
Who'd imagine you were one of them?

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,250
Did you come to rob the place?

28
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,890
What can you do in your condition?

29
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,990
Have you grown so crazy that you don't even know what you're doing?

30
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,500
You don't look so hot yourself.

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,730
You're pale. Got a stomachache or something? Is it diarrhea?

32
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,700
You're the one with diarrhea.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,950
Hey, what's the matter? You're bleeding.

34
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,870
Hey, what's the matter? You're bleeding.

35
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,240
Zura, look. Gintoki's shown up.

36
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,440
Looks like he's about to take on Benizakura.

37
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,420
He's as foolish as ever.

38
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,150
It's like taking on a battleship with a rolling pin.

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,350
He no longer moves like a human.

40
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,950
His body is crying out because it can't keep up with the Benizakura's commands.

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,980
That man is going to die.

42
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,360
You knew...

43
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,820
what would happen if he used the Benizakura.

44
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,520
You were his comrade. Don't you feel anything?

45
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,990
He chose to do that on his own.

46
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,610
If he dies because of it, he gets his wish.

47
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,140
Gets his wish?

48
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,400
That's right! That man truly wished to become a sword!

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,750
A sword that protects Takasugi, his beacon light!

50
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,980
He'd rather fly into the fire than return to darkness.

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,840
He wanted the power to grow.

52
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,130
His eyes have been blinded by light-he can't see anything else.

53
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,310
How sad and foolish...

54
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,170
But inside him is a beauty that transcends good and evil...

55
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,120
Like a single sword stroke, there is beauty!

56
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,400
Swords kill. Master smiths forge swords. What then...

57
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,230
are samurai?

58
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:39,160
And an object that exists for a single purpose is strong, flexible and beautiful.

59
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,420
Just like this.

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,660
They're simpletons. But I don't hate them.

61
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,800
I, too, can see only a single path before my eyes.

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,670
I don't care if my comrades or anyone falls by the wayside.

63
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,070
What's so beautiful about bloodshed?

64
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,410
Are you saying that's the goal of your art?

65
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,550
Enough of this. I don't want to see blood spilt by a sword my brother made.

66
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,580
Then why did you bring that man here?!

67
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,720
It's as if you brought him here to be killed!

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,870
And with that dull blade of yours.

69
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,160
You think he can defeat the Benizaka?

70
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,800
I-Impossible!

71
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,140
He's matched against Benizakura...

72
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,810
No! He's even stronger?!

73
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,870
It can't be...

74
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,000
Benizakura's been draining Nizo's strength and accumulating data to discover its opponent's weaknesses.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,820
Benizakura's should be several levels higher.

76
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,420
...It can't be.

77
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,500
That man...

78
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,900
He's improving faster than the Benizakura?!

79
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,620
No, that's...!

80
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,160
In the midst of an extreme fight to the death...

81
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,770
have the memories of past battles lying dormant deep inside his body been awakened?

82
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,380
It's the White Knight!

83
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,160
It won't go out.

84
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,120
No matter how many times I try to extinguish it.

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,500
That annoying light won't go out...

86
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,700
You appear to have studied sword fighting at a dojo before,

87
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,080
but it seems this is your first fight with a real sword.

88
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,350
You're shaking.

89
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,800
[Note: Spoof of that Jackie Chan movie]

90
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,510
This is called the Drunken Sword.

91
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,800
A rare form where the drunker I get, the stronger I...

92
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,520
Don't force yourself.

93
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,480
For your information, my sword style is called Shimura-Ken.

94
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,170
It's what that comedian often uses in his skits.

95
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,330
You, too?!

96
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:10,550
I'm more of the thinker type, so I usually leave these matters to that wild boar woman.

97
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,370
Who're you calling a wild boar?!

98
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,290
Want me to shoot a slug into those lame chicken legs?

99
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,890
A real fight is all about guts, Senpai! It's kill or be killed!

100
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,510
Gotcha!

101
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,090
You can't move in mid-air. Die!

102
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
Got her!

103
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,230
You're a hundred years too young to be trying to kill me, little girl!

104
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,890
Gin-san!

105
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,310
Gin-chan.

106
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,560
Wh...What?!

107
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,630
What the hell is this?

108
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,370
Nizo-san?

109
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,430
I told you, I'm not good at this sort of thing.

110
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,890
Senpai!

111
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,140
Nizo! Have you lost your mind?!

112
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,640
He's conscious... He's being controlled by the Benizakura.

113
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,770
Tsk, my nasty premonition hit the bullseye!

114
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,260
Stop, Nizo!

115
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,320
He's been completely overwhelmed by the Benizakura!

116
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,650
Nizo has lost all sense of self. His entire body has transformed into a sword!

117
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,880
Not even the White Knight can stop him now!

118
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,890
That is the Benizakura's final form. The ultimate sword!

119
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,060
Such power comes only to those

120
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,510
who discarded all meaningless distractions from their lives and devote themselves to a single goal.

121
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,630
There's no way a person like you, always distracted by life's trivial things, can ever stop him!

122
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,820
Gin-san!

123
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,680
Gin-chan!

124
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,900
Won't... That annoying light...

125
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,420
won't go out...

126
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,840
Tetsuko!

127
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,220
I won't let him die! I won't let you kill him!

128
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,220
I won't let that sword destroy any more lives!

129
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,990
You!

130
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,350
Let that mop head go!

131
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,230
What the?!

132
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,900
Let him go!

133
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,930
Why... Why?

134
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,120
Why can't you understand?

135
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,720
I've given everything I have to create the Benizakura.

136
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,120
Discarded every shred of conscience and restraint.

137
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,200
It's everything to me. If I lose it, then I'll have nothing left.

138
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,420
We suffered a real loss.

139
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,100
No one else will ever be able to create swords like he did.

140
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,850
I heard he has a son. How good is he?

141
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,340
He's no good.

142
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,460
Had his father not been Jintetsu, the once-in-a-generation master swordsmith,

143
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,400
he'd have no problem making a living with his craft.

144
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,170
From that day on...

145
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,590
Tetsuko...your swordsmith skills are rough, but you possess something Tetsuya does not.

146
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,830
I hope he understands that someday.

147
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,510
In order to surpass my Father, I completely devoted my life to swordsmithing.

148
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,470
I put my craft before everything else.

149
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,010
I don't need anyone...

150
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,390
I don't need anything but the sword.

151
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,970
It's everything to me. There's nothing else in my life...

152
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,830
Tetsuko!

153
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,490
Brother!

154
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,800
Gin-chan!

155
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,800
Gin-san!

156
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,450
Brother! Pull yourself together! Brother!

157
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,500
Brother...

158
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,680
Now it makes sense...

159
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,110
I thought I had forsaken everything in my life but the sword.

160
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,960
I tried to live my life...not as a human being...but as a swordsmith...

161
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,820
living only to create swords.

162
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,130
But when it came to the very end,

163
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,710
you were the one thing...I couldn't give up...

164
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,830
With that kind of halfway commitment,

165
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,050
there was no way I could forge the ultimate sword.

166
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,140
Nothing is meaningless!

167
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,610
Everything matters.

168
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,580
Devoting your life solely to making swords? Is that what a craftsman does?

169
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,320
Those are noble words. But you just don't want to be bothered.

170
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,020
Don't call yourself a craftsman when you don't even have...

171
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,530
the courage to shoulder the trials of life.

172
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,390
Watch. See how powerful the things you call meaningless can be.

173
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:24,350
Take a good look at this blade your sister forged and see how well it cuts.

174
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,330
Gin-san! That's impossible!

175
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,700
You can't take the Benizakura head on.

176
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,580
Gin-chan!

177
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,130
After all, swords are made for killing people.

178
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,330
You can't change that, no matter how much heart and soul you put into it.

179
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,780
But that's no reason for us to stop wielding our hammer. We'd go hungry.

180
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,620
No, it's not just that. We are creating more than just weapons.

181
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,970
That's why we have to keep on hammering at it over and over.

182
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,310
We aren't just forging the iron, but our very own souls.

183
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,770
You hammer your soul into shape just as you hammer the iron.

184
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,000
Become a gentle person with integrity. Live your life beautifully.

185
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,650
If you become a good person,

186
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,030
those who would use your swords with decency will be drawn to you.

187
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,730
What sort of sword do you want to forge?

188
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,180
A sword that protects.

189
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,780
Huh? I can't hear you.

190
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,470
A sword that protects people.

191
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,800
It's too...bright...

192
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,470
A sword that...protects people... That's so like you, Tetsuko.

193
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,880
It would seem I haven't hammered long enough...

194
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,640
Tetsuko... Become a good...

195
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,330
swordsmi...

196
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,160
I can't hear you... Brother...

197
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,420
You have to tell me the way you always do...in your loud voice...

198
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,580
I can't hear you.

199
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,940
Takasugi, I never liked you. Back then, or now.

200
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,260
But you were my comrade.

201
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,990
Back then, and now.

202
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,740
When did it all begin? When did our paths diverge?

203
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,000
Hmph. What're you talking about?

204
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,740
It's true that the two of us started in the same place.

205
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,820
But even back then,

206
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,380
we were heading in different directions.

207
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,600
Everyone is doing as they please.

208
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,460
We've all lived our lives...

209
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,470
looking towards different directions.

210
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,920
Nothing in me has changed since then.

211
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,620
What I look towards now hasn't changed a bit.

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,270
I...

213
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,860
Elizabeth-san, we've done all we can do! We can't hold out any longer!

214
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,500
[For real?]

215
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,340
Katsura-san is still...

216
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,870
What are those battleships?

217
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,240
Are they our allies coming to help?

218
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,240
No...that flag is...

219
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,250
Th-That can't be! What're they doing here?!

220
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,050
It's the Harusame! The Harusame space pirates!

221
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,570
Zura, when you took up your sword for the sake of the country and your comrades,

222
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,760
I could've cared less.

223
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,880
Think about it.

224
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,580
Who was it that taught us how to use that sword you're holding?

225
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,080
Who was it that taught us the path of the samurai, how to survive and other things?

226
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,270
Without a doubt, the man who made us the men we are was...

227
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,370
Shoyo Sensei.

228
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,910
But this new world...

229
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,910
took him away from us.

230
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,640
If that's the case, then our only choice is to fight this world.

231
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,240
To squash the world that took away our master.

232
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,020
Tell me, Zura, what do you think about as you live in this world?

233
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,300
How can we live comfortably and relish life in the world that took our master away from us?

234
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,270
It makes me angry to no end.

235
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,980
Takasugi...

236
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,850
You don't know how many times I've thought about wiping out this world clean slate.

237
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,540
But when I see Gintoki bearing it...

238
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,120
When I see...

239
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,320
him learning to live in a world he should be despising more than anyone, what can I do?

240
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,490
I can no longer destroy this country.

241
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,100
I now have...

242
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,220
too many precious things here I care about.

243
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,560
When I look at you, all I see is someone who can't sheathe his sword.

244
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,840
You've become just a wild beast that enjoys destruction.

245
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,610
If you don't like this country, then destroy it.

246
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,870
But I won't just stand and watch you destroy the people I care for.

247
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,940
There must be another way.

248
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,270
Other ways to change this country without costly sacrifices.

249
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,210
I'm sure that's what Shoyo Sensei would have wanted.

250
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,820
It's Katsura.

251
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,230
It's really Katsura.

252
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,830
Stay back. He's mine.

253
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,360
Amanto?!

254
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:46,500
Zura, I heard about you. That you and Gintoki beat up the Harusame.

255
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,530
I was trying to link up with them to gain their backing.

256
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,500
But thanks to you, I think it'll go well.

257
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,910
When I present them with your head.

258
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,590
Takasugi!

259
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:05,580
I told you... I will destroy this rotten world.

260
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,020
Why are the Harusame here?!

261
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
[Who knows?!]

262
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,600
That damn Takasugi joined forces with the Amanto to destroy the Bakufu!

263
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,600
Bansai-dono...

264
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,210
We were told we could take the heads of Katsura and that other samurai.

265
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,650
Bansai-dono?

266
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,810
Are you listening, Bansai-dono?

267
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,030
I'm listening. This is Edo's top singer, Terakado...

268
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,640
Not that! What I just said!

269
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,750
Who's this guy? Why'd they send him to negotiate?!

270
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,080
No need to worry.

271
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,660
They're probably just small fries that Katsura brought with him.

272
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,770
They'll be taken care of very quickly.

273
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,150
Move... You're in the way!

274
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,140
Odd Jobs Gin-chan coming through!

275
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
Ow ow.

276
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,880
You guys sure are full of spirit.

277
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,370
Ack... What's that?!

278
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,700
No mistake! It's that samurai...

279
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,360
Out of my wayI I'm in a bad mood!

280
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,490
Katsura-san!

281
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,680
Yo, Zura. What's with the new hair?

282
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,030
Somebody break your heart or something?

283
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,770
Shut up. It's a new look. What about you? Get hit by a bomb?

284
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,830
Shut up. It's a new look.

285
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,260
You call that a look?

286
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,170
Katsura-san! Your orders.

287
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,090
Retreat.

288
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,510
What?!

289
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,770
The Benizakura's been destroyed.

290
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,010
There's another ship behind us. Hurry.

291
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,610
You're not getting away!

292
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,620
Hunt down and kill every last one of them!

293
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,290
We'll secure your escape route.

294
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,010
Go.

295
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,580
But...!

296
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,360
Gin-chan!

297
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,780
Let us down, Lizzie!

298
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,420
Gin-chan!

299
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,040
Go! Take their heads!

300
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,460
D-Don't back down!

301
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,050
Push forward! Forward! Don't give them any openings!

302
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,340
So they're Gintoki Sakata and Kotaro Katsura...

303
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,820
They're strong... I'd like to face them someday.

304
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,080
Gintoki!

305
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,930
Huh?

306
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,530
The world doesn't go the way you hope, does it?

307
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,530
It's not easy changing a friend, much less a country!

308
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,310
Zura, you mean you had a friend? Stop fantasizing!

309
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,040
You want me to kill you?!

310
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,390
Gintoki!

311
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,280
Huh?

312
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Don't change, okay.

313
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,650
It would take a lot of mettle to kill you. I wouldn't take the job.

314
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,760
Zura, the day you change, I'll be the first one there to take you out.

315
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,710
Takasugi! This is how it is!

316
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,110
The next time we meet, it won't be as friends or comrades!

317
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,050
We'll cut you down...with every ounce of our strength!

318
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,640
So you better watch out.

319
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,970
Don't bump into us on the street!

320
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,740
Farewell!

321
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,680
Don't let them get away!

322
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,770
Fire! Fire!

323
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,310
That's being well-prepared. Are you Lupin or something?

324
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:26,930
[Note: Refers to the anime character Lupin III.]

325
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,930
I'm not Lupin, I'm Zura. Oops, I mean Katsura.

326
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,030
There's a reason why I've been able to give the Shinsengumi the slip all this time.

327
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,000
But I never imagined he was holding on to this, too.

328
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,460
We all started at the same place. And yet...

329
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,670
We're now worlds apart.

330
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,080
Gintoki... Do you remember this?

331
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,020
Yeah...

332
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,350
I tossed it after I spilled ramen on it.

333
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,080
["Even Mummy Hunters Sometimes Turn into Mummys"]

334
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,830
What? You want me to kill the boss of Odd Jobs?!

335
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,080
Hijikata-san!

336
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,390
[Gintoki is suspected of being an Anti-Foreigner Faction member. Working under Hijikata's order, Yamazaki closes in.]

337
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,990
[Sorachi-san, thanks for the other day. Let's go and have a drink of that with that.]
