00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,070
Hey, hold it!

164
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,090
Come on! This is Lassie's second cousin!

165
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,260
He should be worth a month's rent!

166
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,260
I don't want it even if it's the cousin of the Dog of Flanders!

167
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,270
OK, here's the plan.

168
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,960
While Kagura is taking a nap, we'll go look for another owner.

169
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,040
Plan? Are you sure? Kagura will be very upset.

170
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,020
It's all right.

171
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,420
By experiencing harsh reality, a young girl climbs the stairway to maturity.

172
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,260
And an idol otaku graduates from fandom.

173
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,520
Do you mean me?! Are you talking about me?!

174
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,260
No way! I'll never graduate!

175
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,700
Let's go!

176
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,980
Hey, move it! You giant poop vendor!

177
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,850
It should be around here.

178
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,750
Hijikata...

179
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,900
What're you doing?

180
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,730
Watch out.

181
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,960
Wh-What?! It's him!

182
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,540
Mmm... Huh? Sadaharu?

183
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,810
Sadaharu?

184
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,130
He's finally settled down.

185
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,550
What're we gonna do?

186
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,550
I doubt there's anyone who wants to adopt Sadaharu.

187
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,900
Don't worry. I have an idea.

188
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,910
Wahh! Another debut!

189
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,170
My house is your idea?!

190
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,270
You plan to dump off Sadaharu at my place?!

191
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,070
Well, your sister's having trouble with a stalker, right?

192
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,080
You took care of that the other day!

193
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,280
We help each other out when we can.

194
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,580
He'll be the perfect guard dog.

195
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,240
Listen to me, damn it!

196
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,160
Don't bite!

197
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,050
Oh?

198
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,920
What are you two doing?

199
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,610
Sheesh! Where'd Sadaharu and Gin go?

200
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,240
So, you think you could take this dog in?

201
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,670
We already have a useless adolescent boy.

202
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,550
To take in one more...

203
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,700
Isn't "useless" a bit harsh?

204
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,350
Besides, Sis, this is a dog!

205
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,830
Seriously, please! Sadaharu says he prefers it here.

206
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,560
What do you mean by that?!

207
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,880
While my back was turned!

208
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,410
No, you've got it all wrong.

209
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,270
This is for Sadaharu's sake.

210
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,490
You're terrible, Gin!

211
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,670
Hey, he seems to like you quite a lot.

212
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,140
Sadaharu!

213
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,310
Come here!

214
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,930
Boy, they get on like a house on fire. Makes you wanna smile, huh, Shinpachi?

215
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,320
Yes. I guess girls and big goofy dogs go together, Gin.

216
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,590
I wonder why it just won't take to us?

217
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,370
It knows that we're trying to get rid of him.

218
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,870
It's the instinct of the wild.

219
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,740
Why is it so attached to her, Shinpachi?

220
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,450
It isn't, Gin.

221
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,060
It's attacking her, but Kagura doesn't think anything of it, Gin.

222
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,480
Quit playing around!

223
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,280
I see, so that's how it is, huh, Shinpachi.

224
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,770
Yep.

225
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,690
There!

226
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,600
You seem to be having fun.

227
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,360
Yup!

228
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
I love animals.

229
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,030
All girls love cute things. Don't need a reason for that.

230
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,440
That's cute?

231
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,670
Of course, it's cute!

232
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,320
This is the first time an animal has gotten so attached to me!

233
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,750
Kagura, you should realize it already.

234
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,770
I...

235
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,680
...used to have pet long ago.

236
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,590
Sadaharu No.1!

237
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,020
Sadaharu No.1 was super cute and I loved him so much.

238
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,890
I kept Sadaharu No.1 outside, but one night, I really, really wanted to sleep with him,

239
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,810
so I snuggled with him under the covers without telling my parents.

240
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,370
I had a nightmare and thrashed around all night.

241
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,410
It was a terrible nightmare and when I woke up...

242
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,050
Sadaharu was lying there stiff.

243
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,670
Should I be laughing or crying?

244
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,940
After that, I swore I'd never get close to animals.

245
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,490
I'm not good at controlling my strength, and I only end up hurting them.

246
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,390
But maybe this Sadaharu and I will make a good pair.

247
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,810
He's a gift from the heavens. I'm sure of it, uh-huh.

248
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,530
I forgot I'm out of pickled seaweed. I'm gonna go and buy some.

249
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,260
Take care of Sadaharu for me!

250
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,970
Hey, wait!

251
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,080
Hey, Sadaharu!

252
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,460
G-G-Gin!

253
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,640
Gin!

254
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,630
H-Help!

255
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,180
I'm saved!

256
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,520
He looks cute sleeping like that.

257
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,050
He's a demon in a dog's clothing.

258
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,590
In a manic world with ferocious dogs, we must watch our hearts!

259
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,270
But after watching Kagura love it so much, it's sorta...

260
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,320
Oh, there you are.

261
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,800
Huh? You guys?

262
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,280
What's up with you? Don't you even work during the day?

263
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,570
Looking for a companion to have fun with?

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,070
Like I'd invite you to join our fun! A fight's different, though!

265
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,830
That fight you picked last time? I gave it right back to you.

266
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,810
Fine!

267
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,060
Then this time, I'll give it right back to you with a fruit basket as a bonus!

268
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,230
By the way... Is that your dog?

269
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,220
It's not really my dog. Why you asking?

270
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,030
Don't go off talking without me!

271
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,960
There's a certain someone connected to the upper ranks of the government

272
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,730
who's interested in animals like that.

273
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,070
We'd like you to hand that dog over to the Shinsengumi.

274
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,730
Forget it. I wouldn't give it to guys like you.

275
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,580
Don't ever forget that I don't bow down to the Shinsengumi.

276
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,100
You're forgetting that I'm standing right here!

277
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,290
Damn! What'll we do, Sogo?

278
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,840
I think you'll just have to end your sentences with bow-wow.

279
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,630
As if!

280
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,830
Gin, did you refuse for Kagura's sake?

281
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,810
Naw...

282
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,100
I just don't like doing what I'm told.

283
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,270
Oh...There's no animal that catches my eye.

284
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,980
Every one of them seems to be lacking in something.

285
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,530
You are right.

286
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,720
Isn't there anything we can do?

287
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,490
Look out!

288
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,990
Jii!

289
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,910
What have you done?!

290
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,970
Calm down, my prince!

291
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,060
I will go and find a time machine.

292
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,110
You calm down, Jii.

293
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,670
Wh-What is this?!

294
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,900
What's wrong, my prince?

295
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,070
Jii! Look at this!

296
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,560
Did you find a time machine?!

297
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,220
No! You old geezer!

298
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,020
This is...a Dog God! What a rare species.

299
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,520
Do you have a rope?

300
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,120
Should we be doing this, my prince?

301
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,240
We're behaving like common criminals.

302
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,970
This is conservation! I can't allow such a precious specimen to stay in the wild!

303
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,210
All right, let's go!

304
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:52,970
Yes, sire.

305
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,240
I've added to my collection again!

306
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,010
Deer poop...

307
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,060
Sadaharu!

308
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,260
The last time I was here, I had a horrible time

309
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,090
with that silver-haired man and that weird girl.

310
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,110
But this'll finally ease the pain of losing Pesu.

311
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,930
Right, Jii?

312
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,900
Absolutely.

313
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,930
A-A zombie!

314
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,710
Hey, stop the car, you jerk.

315
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,020
Y-You again!

316
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,710
I gave it a lot of thought,

317
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,420
but cut me some slack on this one here.

318
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,720
Seems she's really taken a liking to that thing.

319
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,550
What are you blabbering about?! Move!

320
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,240
I can't see in front of me, dammit!

321
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,710
Wha--?!

322
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,870
What's the matter?

323
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,130
A weird kid is approaching at tremendous speed!

324
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,450
Give back Sadaharu!

325
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,180
Who is Sadaharu?!

326
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,450
St-Stay back!

327
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,740
I forgot Sadaharu was on the car.

328
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,270
Sadaharu!

329
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,600
I've gone and...done it...all over again.

330
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,390
'Scuse me, miss.

331
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,360
What are you so sad about?

332
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,860
Gin! Sadaharu!

333
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,530
Sadaharu!

334
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,470
Sadaharu! I'm so glad! I'm so, so glad!

335
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,740
Gin, you were so against keeping him.

336
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,580
Hell if I know.

337
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,210
If you're gonna keep it, you take care of it.

338
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,590
And I'll be deducting the cost of his food from your salary!

339
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,160
Thank you, Gin.

340
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,620
Though I've never actually gotten paid.

341
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,270
Let's not come to Earth anymore.

342
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,850
I agree.

343
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,430
Remember to say bow-wow at the end of your sentences, Kondo.

344
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,110

Find a poster girl from a dango shop?

346

And you're telling me it's from fifty years ago?!

347
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,820
Listen, pops.

348
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,850
Even if we do find her, she'll be someone who used to be a poster girl.
