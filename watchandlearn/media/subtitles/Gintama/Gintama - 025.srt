00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,950
Well, Gin Tama the anime is about to start its third season.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,080
For a while there, I thought they were gonna cancel us.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,670
We made it by the skin of our teeth.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,120
No one expected us to last, so they didn't write any stories for the third season yet.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,020
Whatever, they can just create those special "highlight" episodes using old clips and rearranging them.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,060
They can insert two or three new clips and fool everyone.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,910
Hey!

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,900
Well then, why don't we go down memory lane with the past episodes?

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,040
So what sort of things have happened, huh?

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,430
Like Shinpachi getting stuck in that ditch and Shinpachi puking in his sleep,

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,780
and Shinpachi puking in his sleep...

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,080
Hey! That's a big lie! Besides, why mention it twice?!

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,290
Whatever! Shinpachi, recap everything that's happened up to now.

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,780
No thanks. Men don't relive the past.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,530
Hey, you're talking back!

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,660
I guess six months does make a difference to humans.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,030
Oh yes, they change.

19
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,120
In six months, this little weakling has turned into a macho lover boy.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,360
That's not true! Absolutely not true!

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,580
Act now and you can get a can of protein powder free!

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,810
No thanks! I still have some at home.

23
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,000
You actually ordered it?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,480
Yeah, unsuspectingly.

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,170
A jug works better than those silly muscle-building machines.

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,830
It doesn't work. You're being fooled!

27
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,620
She means jugs you fill with water and use to do lifts.

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,230
Are you some Jackie Chan? And besides, he's already fifty!

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,530
Oh man, when'd I stop going to see his movies?

30
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,870
I guess Jackie Chan is the turning point when a boy turns into a man.

31
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,190
That's a disputable dividing line.

32
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,340
Jackie will make those who belittle him cry!

33
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,470
I will not!

34
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,650
Try jumping off a watchtower or a chandelier!

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,820
I will not! Like I can! Why are you so hooked on Jackie today?!

36
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,370
Do you live in Jackie Village or something?!

37
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,700
Okay, has it been five minutes, yet?

38
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,540
Nope, only one minute and fifty seconds. There's still lots more time.

39
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,720
Don't you think, maybe...if we keep doing this, the higher-ups will get angry?

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,680
Higher-ups? Like who?

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,250
Well, I mean... Someone watching this or being shown this...or being made to listen to this.

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,430
People like that.

43
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,950
Man, what a pain.

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,820
Oh well, let's start then.

45
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,060
[The Gin Tama anime third season special! Famous, exciting and moving scenes by Odd Jobs members.]

46
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,060
[By the way, the host for "Ladies 4" was changed to the son of Tokumitsu-san, you know.]

47
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,610
Hey, are we still on this cut?!

48
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,150
Let's start then.

49
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,070
The Gin Tama anime third season special!

50
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,620
The "This happened, that happened, so many things happened" highlight special!

51
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,710
Let's get started!

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,630
Hey, this is supposed to be a highlight special.

53
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,640
We're supposed to look back. Someone reminisce!

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,090
Nope. The pot needs to be watched. I'll watch it, so you two can reminisce.

55
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,240
I'll watch the pot, Shinpachi, so start.

56
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,430
You were made for this kind of thing! Have some confidence in yourself.

57
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,400
I don't like compliments like that.

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,470
Kagura-chan, say something.

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,480
No way! While I'm looking away, you guys will eat all the meat.

60
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,680
Sheesh, give us a break, will you?

61
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,370
You really think we'd do anything that despicable?

62
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,270
Really, this is such a happy occasion. Don't say such hurtful things!

63
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,460
Yeah. Yeah.

64
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,360
Sure, we hardly ever get to eat sukiyaki.

65
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,120
But this is a special occasion and we're here to celebrate.

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,970
And you had to say such an awful thing. I'm depressed.

67
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,980
You were wrong just now, Kagura-chan. So apologize.

68
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,510
M'kay, dammit.

69
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,890
My bad.  I said a stupid thing.

70
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,580
Now!

71
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,100
["A Shared Soup Pot is a Microcosm of Life"]

72
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,870
Oh man, the precious meat is broken up into bits.

73
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,080
You guys pulled it apart. So much drama over silly sukiyaki.

74
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,210
Damn it! You guys tricked me!

75
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,170
It's your fault that my heart is turning blacker and colder!

76
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,950
That's how we grow up to become adults.

77
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,880
Aren't you lucky? You took one step towards becoming a grown up.

78
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,690
Didn't I teach you that meal times are like a battlefield? Have you forgotten?

79
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,290
I'll never believe anything Gin-chan says ever again!

80
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,380
You're all enemies! I won't trust anyone.

81
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,400
That's a good thing to keep in mind. Hate me more. Blame me! And curse me!

82
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,940
Use the power of that hatred to make it through this rotten world.

83
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,360
It's your head that's rotten!

84
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,320
Then tell me what's inside that hair bun head of yours?

85
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,390
This is bad. So it's come down to this.

86
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,930
Having a sukiyaki dinner here at Odd Jobs

87
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,650
What's in here are the pure thoughts of a young girl.

88
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,820
is like throwing Tomoko Matsushima into a den of lions.

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,210
Pure? Well then, my Gin Tama soul is filled with a man's ambitions.

90
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,260
At this rate, all the beef will be torn into shreds before it even hits our tongues.

91
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,020
More like radioactive waste.

92
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,140
Rather than thinking about how to eat more meat than anyone else,

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,160
What's that supposed to mean? There isn't a pun anywhere in that line.

94
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,250
I should be thinking about protecting it from those greedy two.

95
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,830
I'm sick and tired of your old jokes.

96
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,110
But they're hot-headed right now. If I clumsily stop them, it may backfire.

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,960
I don't give a damn!

98
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,110
The cute little girl with the poison tongue. That's so yesterday.

99
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,080
The old, ignorant man. That's old news.

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,250
No... They're stupid, but their pride is first class. If I provoke that...

101
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,380
Yuck! What's this smell of old age!!

102
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,700
It's a huge risk, but this is the only way to protect the beef!

103
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,550
A kid like you wouldn't understand the mature body odor of a grown-up.

104
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,050
That's enough for me.

105
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,680
I don't want to eat if we're gonna fight over it. This is stupid.

106
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,810
Actually, I had yakiniku with my sister yesterday.

107
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,430
I had too much to eat... More like, I can have it anytime I want.

108
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,770
So you two can go at it.

109
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,270
Come!

110
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,280
Come on!

111
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Bring it on!

112
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,780
Oh well...

113
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,930
It's not like I really wanted to eat meat anyway.

114
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,270
We came into some money, so I thought we'd splurge and have a nabe hot pot.

115
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,210
If it's gonna be like this, I give up. Let's stop.

116
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,890
You all okay with that?

117
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,180
Yeah, fine with me!

118
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,620
I'm not particularly eager to eat beef. I'm a vegetarian, after all!

119
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,880
Let's stop already, forget the sukiyaki!

120
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,810
You can have it, dammit!

121
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,820
Yes! But I think my act was more effective than I anticipated.

122
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,660
It feels like this might end right here.

123
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,140
Damn, I'm the one that started saying such a thing.

124
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,480
So I can't backtrack and suggest we heat up the nabe again.

125
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,520
Besides, it's embarrassing.

126
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,770
This is bad.

127
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,280
I wanted to gauge the situation, so I followed along with Shinpachi,

128
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,160
but I didn't expect Kagura to agree.

129
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,270
It'll be next to impossible to start up the nabe again.

130
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,220
However, if I don't do anything, there won't be a nabe dinner.

131
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,550
And we haven't even started.

132
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,180
No way! I must avoid that at all costs.

133
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,800
Someone, make a move.

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,660
I want to eat meat. I'm craving it so badly. I want to stuff myself with it!

135
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,560
Come on, Shinpachi. Say something. Please! I'll give you 300 yen!

136
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,250
Come on, someone! Say something! I want to eat meat.

137
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,360
Actually, I haven't eaten any meat for nearly six months!

138
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,130
We're all the same! We're all one at heart!

139
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,230
Huh? What? Hey, Kagura, what's up? Are you hungry?

140
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,800
No, I'm not. That was a fart.

141
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,100
No, that wasn't a fart. That was your stomach growling.

142
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,940
I'm sure of it. So what? Are you that hungry?

143
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,860
I'm not hungry. I'm full.

144
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,920
Well, if you're that hungry, shall we have the nabe, after all?

145
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,020
It doesn't matter to me, but what do you wanna do?

146
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,720
Kagura-chan, don't hold back if you're hungry. I'm okay either way.

147
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,960
Well, it's right in front of us. But it doesn't matter to me.

148
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,570
Yes. It is wasteful, I guess. I'm okay either way, though.

149
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,470
I'm hungry, but it's okay. I have my pickled seaweed.

150
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,180
You idiot!

151
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,490
You're a growing child!

152
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,920
What do you think will happen if you suck on stuff like that and don't eat properly?!

153
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,410
Don't you feel grateful towards the farmers and the cow?!

154
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,420
C'mon. You can have some of mine.

155
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Really?

156
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,290
Sure. I said I bought it for you guys.

157
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,670
Hurry and eat, kid. Or I'll kill you!

158
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,040
Oh well, shall we eat too, then?

159
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,480
Not that I'm especially hungry.

160
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,880
What a bother.

161
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,170
But if I don't join you, I'll spoil the mood. Shinpachi, you eat too.

162
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,640
Oh okay. I'm not craving meat much either.

163
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,650
But I've been taught that it's wasteful to leave such things uneaten.

164
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:16,700
Phew...got past that hurdle. But it's harder than before to reach for some meat.

165
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,410
After refusing the sukiyaki, there's an air of hesitation now.

166
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,460
Isn't there something to break this tension?

167
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,140
Isn't there something?

168
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,400
Isn't there...something?!

169
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,610
That was a close call.

170
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,760
[Finally lost them.]

171
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
Never mind that. What're you guys doing here?!

172
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,370
[Excuse us.]

173
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,870
There was an unforeseen circumstance.

174
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,500
Oh yeah?

175
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,770
You big liar!

176
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,680
Sorry, but we need to hide out some egg here.

177
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,170
We'll try our beef not to trouble you and take advantage of your green onions.

178
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,380
We're sorry konjak. We're grateful - sukiyaki.

179
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,380
What's he saying?!

180
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,750
[Don't mind us. Please continue eating.]

181
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,320
At it again, eh, Zura?

182
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
It's not Zura. It's Katsura.

183
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,720
Yeah right. It's so obvious he's lying!

184
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
But his entrance has helped change the mood in here. But we can't let him join in.

185
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,330
Oh, you figured it out?

186
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll bet he's got it all planned, up to that last line.

187
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh please. Let's all enjoy this together.

188
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,810
Wh-What?! What is this pretty boy thinking?!

189
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,070
Trying to act so nice and sweet!

190
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,550
Sweeter than mixing strawberry milk and sweet bean jam!

191
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,290
Hey, that sounds good. I'll try it next time.

192
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,250
But anyway...!

193
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,750
[Oh, really? Well then, maybe just a little.]

194
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,750
Thank you.

195
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,540
The aura of hesitation that our war of words created has dissipated thanks to their entrance.

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,610
So now...

197
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,650
The challenge is who will go on the offensive in this quiet calm

198
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,470
and grab the first piece of beef!

199
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,390
The one prepared to own up to the descriptions, "nasty-spirited" and "food greedy."

200
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,510
Whoever takes the first grab regardless of the others before him, will have the right to control the nabe!

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,240
And he is the...

202
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,250
[Nabe Shogun]

203
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,250
Nabe Shogun!

204
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,020
Here goes the first strategy!

205
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,960
The one who takes command wins!

206
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,050
At this point, the one closest to being the Nabe Shogun is Kagura-chan.

207
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,070
Although she hasn't actually touched the nabe pot,

208
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,580
once she finishes eating what's in her bowl,

209
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,300
she has the power right now to reach naturally for the next serving.

210
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,900
But there's no need to worry about her.

211
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,070
From her face, it's obvious that she's relishing the taste of the shirataki.

212
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,370
Among girls her age, there are many fools who think

213
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,680
that eating stuff like shirataki is cooler than eating high-caloric meat.

214
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,130
And these other two. They're not too dangerous.

215
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,570
That's because both are here as guests.

216
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,660
In their position, the chance that they'll make a grab for the nabe first is zero.

217
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,860
After several urgings, they'll meekly take some white cabbage or shirataki.

218
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,010
Nope, can't underestimate Zura.

219
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,190
It's not Zura, it's Katsura.

220
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,950
There's a high possibility that he'll ignore this high-charged atmosphere

221
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,950
and go right into the nabe with his chopsticks.

222
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,770
I guess we can ignore that weird-looking beast.

223
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,470
No way can he use chopsticks with those hands.

224
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,740
Whoa! He's so dexterous!

225
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,710
The biggest problem is with Shinpachi.

226
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,530
He quickly figured out a young girl's tastes and preference,

227
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,360
and offered up a huge serving of shirataki. No doubt, that guy is shrewd.

228
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,590
Darn it! Why didn't I offer a bowl to Gin-san after Kagura-chan?!

229
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,090
I take on the role of the generous friend, and then take a serving last for myself.

230
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,360
And in the process, if I had changed the layout of the food in the nabe...

231
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,910
or given myself the opportunity to reach into the nabe more often...

232
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,180
the title of Nabe Shogun would have been mine!

233
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,770
Wait! Kagura-chan is almost done eating.

234
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,630
How about if I offer to fill her bowl again?

235
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,620
No! I won't have a second chance.

236
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,540
That's because she's sure to want to do it herself this time.

237
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,280
She won't take kindly to someone's offer.

238
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Well then...it's all or nothing!

239
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,650
But, don't you agree?

240
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,450
Friendship, persistence, victory...

241
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,710
Kids these days know how short-lived friendship can be, as well as the futility of victory.

242
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
So all you need is to be a genius.

243
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,710
Got it!

244
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,790
Hey, isn't the heat too low?

245
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,750
Wha--?!

246
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,220
The Nabe Shogun...

247
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,030
is me!

248
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,790
Chopsticks?!

249
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,290
No way! Not in that instant...?!

250
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,960
Go! Chopstick Scud Missile!

251
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,070
[Whoa]

252
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,070
All these days of obscurity were for this moment!

253
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,710
Damn, my side is wide open. Curse you, Zura!

254
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,670
It's not Zura, it's Katsura.

255
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,180
[Meat]

256
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,160
Oh sorry, I think I may have caught a cold.

257
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,260
[She sneezed.]

258
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,260
Huh?! What?!

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,100
She didn't use her hands or her chopsticks, but with one sneeze...

260
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,670
She decided the outcome in one move?!

261
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,470
This strategy...

262
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,870
[Whoever thought it could happen.]

263
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,830
Well frankly, I don't feel like eating a nabe like that.

264
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,080
She's the only one who'll eat the nabe now.

265
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,250
Even if she won through her innocence and purity...

266
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,760
No...this woman...!!

267
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,760
Heh-heh, the title of Nabe Shogun is mine.

268
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,560
She's not pure at all!

269
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,310
This kid has shirataki coming out of her nose!

270
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,230
Kagura, what a frightening child!

271
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,230
[Shivering]

272
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,190
Did you just realize it, boys?

273
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,790
It all started when I made my stomach growl.

274
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,760
All the while, I was concentrating on eating my shirataki. It was all an act.

275
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:12,110
It was a ruse to put all of you greenhorns off guard and take the seat of the Nabe Shogun.

276
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:19,490
Well, you can suck it up and watch as this little girl eats...all your beloved beef!

277
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,350
[N-No way!]

278
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:27,700
[Total defeat]

279
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,150
What?!

280
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,540
She's swallowing it in one gulp!

281
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,460
People of the Yato Clan must have monstrous bellies!

282
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,410
'Evening!

283
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,880
Say, what's this? Don't tell me you've all started?

284
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,170
How rude! I told you to wait until I closed shop.

285
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,470
As if they know what patience means.

286
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,550
Too bad, old biddies. The beef you came to eat is all...

287
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,160
Hey, what's this meat?

288
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,290
Don't tell me you're having pork in sukiyaki?

289
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,360
Come on! Isn't this a party? How pitiful.

290
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,160
It's perfect for these guys.

291
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,870
Pork?!

292
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,010
Th-That's ridiculous?! Pork? Impossible!

293
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,770
I know it tasted like beef.

294
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,260
The flavor of beef...like the beef bowl,

295
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,130
beef and egg bowl and BBQ beef bowl I always eat.

296
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,460
She's right! It was the same scent that I always get a whiff of...

297
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,500
The aroma that wafts through the air the moment that shop door opens.

298
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,700
Well, I got the chance to taste it, but I know it was beef!

299
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,420
Move. This is my seat.

300
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,710
Cripes.

301
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,070
No way...!

302
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,070
No way...

303
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,960
Yes, way.

304
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,310
The "beef" that you've always been eating was all...

305
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,080
Cheap pork!!

306
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,700
Beef is such an expensive delicacy...

307
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,360
did you really think a poor shop like ours could afford it, kid?!

308
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,790
Even I'd like to get a taste of such a thing.

309
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,740
Th-That's...! So everything I believed...was a lie!

310
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,100
So my entire life has been fiction?

311
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,040
And nothing...neither the people nor the associations were real?!

312
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,670
At that moment, I felt an uncertainty, and my legs crumbled under me.

313
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,320
I won't trust anyone... I can't!

314
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,340
That was pork...and the pork was that!

315
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,450
I hope you all break the bone in your little toe!

316
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,290
One down.

317
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,260
Zura is not easy to take down.

318
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,270
It's not Zura, it's Katsura.

319
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,350
And as if I'd die over something like this!
I haven't accomplished anything yet!

320
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,300
[That was a nice line.]

321
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,630
We have to eat good things once in a while.

322
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,140
I splurged and got the expensive stuff today.

323
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,800
Let's eat delicious food, drink delicious sake, and celebrate!

324
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,650
Oh! Mt. Fuji! Geisha! Sukiyaki!

325
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,460
All right, it's almost ready.

326
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,600
This is it...

327
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,990
An old hag with one foot in the grave,

328
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,810
and a middle-aged broad with one foot in the mud.

329
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,290
Call him alive, but poor. Call him alive, but a mystery.

330
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,670
[Mystery]

331
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,170
Easy foes!

332
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,970
He's the problem.

333
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,350
Gin-san, let's settle this.

334
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,940
Otose-san, may I serve you?

335
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,600
I made the first move!

336
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,100
That guy! He's using the same strategy!

337
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,700
This time, I'll become...the Nabe Shogun!

338
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,190
Don't worry. Let's just all serve ourselves.

339
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,460
Shucks! I didn't see that coming!

340
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,710
Now everyone will indiscriminately reach into the nabe pot!

341
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,910
It backfired...

342
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,160
He failed in his attempt to be generous.

343
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,460
And he didn't bank on the possibility that it could counter his strategy!

344
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,120
Blame your youth on that!

345
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,440
[That's a mistake not easy to admit.]

346
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,310
I failed, that's for sure. But I won't concede defeat yet!

347
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,090
That's true... No need to think deeply anymore.

348
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,950
I agree. Men don't turn their backs on a fight.

349
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,190
[Sukiyaki]

350
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,690
Considering the amount of time left, we have to gamble right now!

351
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,430
The winner is the one who first reaches the nabe!

352
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,640
The Nabe Shogun...

353
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,270
is me!

354
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,830
is me!

355
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,460
is me!

356
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,570
Wh-Wha--?!

357
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,970
What's that?!

358
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,180
[What is it?]

359
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,090
R-Ridiculous!

360
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,180
How could this...?!

361
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,280
Can't reach the beef...

362
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,790
Can't get my chopsticks even close...

363
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,060
to the nabe...!

364
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,130
[Squash]

365
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,200
However, there's no way...

366
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,770
we will lose!

367
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,680
They're not Nabe Shogun...

368
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,080
They're...Emperors!

369
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,680
[Nabeleon]

370
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,240
Th-They're in a different class from us!

371
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,650
The pot is so far... I can't reach it!

372
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,520
Damn, why'd they come anyway? Just to torment us?!

373
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,160
What were we fighting for until now?

374
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,800
We were like frogs in the well, fighting and hurting each other.

375
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,980
Was all that suffering meaningless?!

376
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,470
[Defeat]

377
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,100
No...!

378
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
No...!

379
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,480
What?!

380
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,610
What?!

381
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,140
That's why...!

382
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,140
We can't let our fighting be in vain! That's why, this battle...

383
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,470
...can't be lost!

384
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,760
No way!

385
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,040
Go, Kagura! Become...

386
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,450
Nabeleon!

387
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,710
Huh?!

388
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,290
[Oh, the pain!]

389
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,410
It sorta smells like milk and doesn't taste that good. I think I prefer pork.

390
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,840
Why you?! Are you teasing us?!

391
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,930
Spit it out! Spit it all out!

392
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,910
Humans are so worthless.

[Preview]

394
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,380
Taka-chin? You're Taka-chin, my classmate at temple school!

395
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,390
But why'd you join a bike gang?

396
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,320
If...If I had rescued you back then...

[The next episode will be a blood bath. See you there!]

400
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,660
But, why are we using this cut again?

401
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,930
For time adjustment!

402
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,860
In some area, they are announcing presents.

403
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,820
For real?!

404
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,600
And now, here's our last message of the day.

"Gin Tama" supports "DEATH NOTE"!
