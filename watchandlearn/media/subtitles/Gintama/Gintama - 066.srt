You can eat dango alone, but you can't eat sweets alone.

Dango is already out of fashion.

Is that the taste of old tradition?

It sounds like you're a really archaic analog person.

125

it's obvious you'll eventually go out of business.

The shop that clears out all its dango first will win...

159
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,420
What?!

160
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,520
There's already a long line in front of Andromeda, even before the start of the competition!

161
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,760
That means it's the most popular sweets shop in Edo.

162
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,610
And how about Konpeito?

163
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,860
There're no costumers yet.

164
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,180
Dad...

165
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,660
You're not very nice, Sweets-sama. This looks like a fixed race.

166
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,590
I just offered him a competition and he accepted.

167
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,780
It's true. We don't have anything shady going on here, right?

168
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,150
When this competition is over, that property will be mine.

169
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,170
And our shop's reputation will be boosted by word of mouth from customers

170
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,020
who've come here to taste our new Japanese sweets.

171
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,750
This is to our advantage.

172
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,170
It looks like the winner will be decided before the competition even begins!

173
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,760
Yes, for example, it's like the chain death match between Tomoko Matsushima and the lion!

174
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:23,820
[Note: Tomoko Matsushima is an actress who was attacked by a lion in Kenya while visiting for a documentary.]

175
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,820
Ah, what's that?!

176
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,990
Oh! Three people... Only three people...

177
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,560
...are walking towards Konpeito.

178
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,540
Only three people.

179
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,390
What traditional taste.

180
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,480
Mister...

181
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,530
Is all this really free?

182
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,040
Yes. And this is probably the last chance to eat my dango.

183
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,910
Please have help yourselves.

184
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,840
Let the TV Champion Dango King Competition, the final round,

185
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,490
one-hour dango sell-out match! Begin!

186
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,920
Let the TV Champion Dango King Competition, the final round

187
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,450
one-hour dango sell-out match! Begin!

188
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,540
The Andromeda booth has been flooded with customers!

189
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,130
Plates are being emptied, one after another!

190
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,610
[Note: Famous phrase by Musuka from "Castle in the Sky". Host's eyes on the mask also look like Musuka's.]

191
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,780
These people are like ants!

192
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,610
And this man is the commentator and judge, Musashi-san.

193
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,880
He's known as the most famous gourmet in Kabukicho.

194
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,850
You'd better eat while you can.

195
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,340
Thanks for coming to our show.

196
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,550
By the way, today's match seems like a clash between the old and the new way.

197
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,130
How do you see it?

198
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,280
You'd better eat while you can.

199
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,810
Hmm... I see.

200
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,240
It looks like Andromeda has already cleared 100 plates.

201
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,110
Hurry, refill more dango plates.

202
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,110
On the other hand, Konpeito...!

203
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,340
They're so fast!

204
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,750
Although there's only three of them, they're competing against Andromeda.

205
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,890
You guys, eat as much as you can so you won't need to eat for three days!

206
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,030
Mister...

207
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,380
It's the hunger!

208
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,050
They're not here for tasty sweets!

209
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,770
They just came to fill their stomachs!

210
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,800
You'd better eat while you can.

211
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,760
The emptied plates are piling up at a furious pace.

212
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
Is this a symbol of something greater, perhaps the Tower of Babel in Edo?!

213
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,890
How about Andromeda?

214
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,810
This is...!

215
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,280
It's at the mercy of its flood of customers, so they're having a hard time selling dango.

216
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,520
It's like that saying: "Happy events tend to be accompanied by problems."

217
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,270
It's out of control!

218
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,250
There are more customers than we expected.

219
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,090
Now it's getting hard to predict a winner! It's really hard to believe,

220
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,100
but only three people are running a death match against those crowds! Konpeito!

221
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,330
Thanks... You're supporting my shop by doing this...

222
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,840
Well... It doesn't look like we'll get any dango soon.

223
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,640
Dad, I'm hungry.

224
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,210
I want dango.

225
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,380
Well, is it all right if we have that shop's dango?

226
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,360
No way. I want the kind from Andromeda!

227
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,800
Stop being selfish!

228
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,350
We should consider ourselves lucky to even have dango. Be patient.

229
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,800
All right.

230
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,540
Let's go!

231
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,030
Yeah.

232
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
Oh! It's a big family.

233
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,380
A big family has approached Konpeito! Will they spur on Konpeito?

234
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,710
They're 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, plus their father.

235
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,450
Who said you could join the...

236
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,660
Sakata family dining table?

237
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,090
Whoa!

238
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,370
Hey, what are you doing, Mister?

239
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,610
Oh! What's going on?!

240
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,620
He knocked out the first customer to come to the booth!

241
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,860
This is my dining table. I won't let anyone near it.

242
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,630
What?!

243
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,280
A Dinner Table Declaration!

244
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,480
It's Our Dinner Table Declaration.

245
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,910
It doesn't look like he's thinking about the competition.

246
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,280
You'd better eat while you can.

247
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,240
I see... That's a very deep thing to say.

248
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,750
Take this for now.

249
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,240
How devilish! How self-centered! But wait.

250
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,260
Ah! What is that?!

251
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,330
Originally, there were only four dango on a stick, but now they're five!

252
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,720
Th-This is...

253
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,960
It's...one stick of dango.

254
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:47,520
[Note: Spoof of the moving story, "One Bowl of Hot Soba".]

255
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,620
Dad. That's good.

256
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,450
Now we'll still be alive tomorrow.

257
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,800
It's so moving! How impressive!

258
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,850
You'd better eat while you can.

259
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,110
Grow up well.

260
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,110
[Note: Phrase from a hamburger TV spot.]

261
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,180
Mister! This is not the time to say something like that!

262
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,910
This is a competition! Stop messing around...just hurry and eat more dango!

263
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,800
Gin-chan, this goes with rice, too!

264
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,450
What are you doing?!

265
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,300
Why are you eating dango with rice? It'll make you full sooner!

266
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,630
No, the main dish is clearly dango.

267
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,740
The rice is a side dish, you know.

268
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,100
I don't care. I really don't, from the bottom of my heart!

269
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,430
Stop eating it with rice!

270
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,560
There!

271
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,320
I'm not satisfied if I have a meal without rice!

272
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,040
I don't give a damn about Western eating!

273
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,600
Whatever, I'm telling you this competition isn't for your stomach!

274
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,970
Objection.

275
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,650
Isn't it against the rules to bring other foods to a dango competition?

276
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,490
Now Andromeda has made a public protest against a customer at Konpeito.

277
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,730
Musashi-san, as the judge, what do you think about eating dango with white rice?

278
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,950
You'd better eat while you can.

279
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,390
Does that mean it isn't against the rules?

280
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,130
Ya!

281
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,180
Their objection was dismissed!

282
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,140
Whether you eat dango with white rice as a set,

283
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,400
boost your appetite with sugar water, compress it to fit more in your stomach,

284
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,280
have it with mayonnaise, Tabasco or any other seasonings...it's all permitted.

285
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,080
More rice.

286
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,010
Gin-chan, I'm innovating.

287
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,890
If you put dango on top of rice, it's dango-don.

288
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,880
If you pour dango on top of rice, it's dango-rice.

289
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,290
Kagura-chan, I told you not to eat two carbohydrates at the same time.

290
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,800
What are you doing? Takeout?

291
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,250
If I put them in the freezer,

292
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,540
and then warm them up in the microwave later, I can eat them whenever I'm hungry!

293
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,880
Eat them now! It means nothing if you eat them later.

294
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,730
And what a shabby idea!

295
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,780
Objection! Takeout is against the ethics of competition.

296
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,060
Again, Andromeda is raising an objection.

297
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,930
Musashi-san, what do you think? Is takeout against the rules?

298
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,120
You'd better eat while you can.

299
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,540
Does that mean it's against the rules?

300
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
Ya.

301
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,340
Their objection has been sustained.

302
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,140
Takeout is against the rules. Tupperware is prohibited.

303
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,660
Tsk!

304
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,400
Don't "tsk" me!

305
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,800
Now we've passed 30 minutes! There are 30 minutes remaining.

306
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,300
Both teams are struggling to figure out how many plates they should prepare.

307
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,770
Who could have predicted such a close match?

308
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,440
Whichever side brings things under control first will have the advantage.

309
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,800
Sweets-sama!

310
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,750
Don't worry. I have a backup plan.

311
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,090
Hey! Move, move.

312
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,150
Ah, that is...

313
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,540
They're sumo wrestlers! Sumo wrestlers!

314
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,720
All of a sudden, a group of sumo wrestlers appeared

315
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,130
and pushed everyone else away, taking over the table.

316
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,940
They're eating at an amazing speed.

317
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,480
The dango look like malt balls. They're monsters. Real monsters!

318
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,860
Andromeda, 500 plates! Konpeito, 450 plates!

319
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,870
In very little time, the difference has been cut to 50 plates.

320
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,700
What do you think, Musashi-san?

321
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,610
Well... You'd better eat while you can.

322
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,740
So true.

323
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,380
Mister!

324
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,160
Don't worry.

325
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,150
We just finished our snack..

326
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,890
You're full already? This is bad. Really bad.

327
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,080
No...

328
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,730
Now, it's time to get to work.

329
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,130
Come on, appetizer time is over.

330
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,230
Shinpachi!

331
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,270
Yes!

332
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,480
Whoaaa! What's this?!

333
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,210
One person is taking the dango off the skewers to make it easier to eat.

334
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,120
And one person is throwing them into the girl's mouth with perfect control, without breaking a single one.

335
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,450
Combination! The key to something like that is having the perfect combination.

336
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,560
Hey! That's not eating! That's feeding!

337
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,500
An objection has been raised!

338
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,540
You'd better eat while you can.

339
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,160
It means there's no problem.

340
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,210
So fast! It's unbelievably fast!

341
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,110
The sumo wrestlers aren't to be outdone. It's even. It's even!

342
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,110
Both teams are holding their own and not budging one inch.

343
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,550
They're engaged in a fierce battle.

344
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,550
But the fiercest thing is the stomach of that China girl.

345
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,620
Is it bottomless?

346
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,790
She's staying even against five sumo wrestlers. Her stomach may even be bigger...

347
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,730
She's eating rice! She's eating rice between the dango!

348
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,860
Are you crazy? I said no more rice.

349
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,280
I don't give a damn about Western food!

350
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,390
My eyes! My eyes!

351
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,780
Kagura!

352
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,450
Oh no! She's got dango sauce in her eyes. It must hurt.

353
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,320
It doesn't look like she'll be able to get up for a while!

354
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,660
This could be a great chance for Andromeda!

355
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,220
They really made us worry. But this is a nice surprise for the competition.

356
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,920
Now we just have to hope they widen the gap...then...

357
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,290
Oh! But these guys seem to be nearing their limit.

358
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,240
We'll most likely grab a win.

359
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,390
Right.

360
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,530
I wonder if that'll happen.

361
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,530
What?

362
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
Shinpachi.

363
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,070
Take Kagura away now.

364
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,440
[Mind Your Sugar Levels]

365
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,780
Leave the rest to the Sugar King.

366
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,940
Gin-san, that doesn't sound very realistic with your stomach like that.

367
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,790
And your doctor told you to stop eating sweets, right?

368
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,150
If you eat more...

369
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,890
It's not good for young people nowadays to give up so easily.

370
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,920
Right, old man?

371
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,040
Ah, that's true.

372
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,670
Oh, he just keeps going. He keeps on going!

373
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,080
After eating that much dango, his stomach must be at its limit.

374
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,630
So why is he still eating? He loves sweets that much?

375
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,270
Sorry, but we're...

376
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,600
...analog people. We are stubborn and don't know when to give up.

377
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,240
Both teams are beyond their limit.

378
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,020
They're shoving dango down their throats by sheer force of will!

379
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,890
One minute left! The number of plates is even.

380
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,130
You'd better eat while you can.

381
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,450
Oh! Now both teams have stopped eating.

382
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,370
What made them stop at the end?

383
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,510
What happened?! Why have you stopped eating?!

384
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,210
If you eat one more dango, we'll win.

385
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,430
[Note: Gochandesu is a word Sumo wrestlers use a lot.]

386
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,530
I feel like throwing up just looking at dango. Gochandesu.

387
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,430
What?!

388
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,320
They're getting tired of it.

389
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,320
It's normal for a person whose eaten hundreds of the same kind of dango to get sick of it.

390
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,870
Getting tired of it? Are you kidding?!

391
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,880
I've tasted all kinds of sweets and used the experience to create even more kinds of sweets.

392
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,940
And you say they're sick of my dango?!

393
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,330
Sweets-sama, please calm down.

394
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,740
This can't be happening.

395
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,220
It can't be happening. Not with my dango!

396
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,070
My dango is so much better than your shabby small-town dango!

397
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,580
And your people stopped eating, too!

398
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,730
You've created a thousand kinds of tastes for the world.

399
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,160
But all I know is dango.

400
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,350
So I have to create a thousand worlds with dango.

401
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,020
Mister...

402
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,930
Have you come to my shop a thousand times? Have you ever gotten tired of it?

403
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,520
Don't say such a stupid thing. I'm not tired of it.

404
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,340
I'm not tired of it at all, but my stomach is so full, there's no more space left.

405
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,090
Then put it in your ball sack!

406
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,670
Time's up!

407
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,150
Gin-san!

Some things you learn by trying many things,

409
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,360
and some things you learn by stubbornly doing only one thing over and over.

410
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,510
Right?

411
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,280
Mister...

412
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,520
Yeah... It's a tough time for analog people.

413
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,780
Hello, everybody!

414
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,100
Thanks for entering the "My Amanto Idea" contest.

415
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,370
The winning idea is Noriko Mach.

416
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,910
Congratulations to Saito-san from Tokyo.
