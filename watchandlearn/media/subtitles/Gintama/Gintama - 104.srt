Yamato series anime.]

3
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,720
Gentlemen of the Yamato,
our Chief, Isao Kondo

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,400
has been safely rescued.

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,930
Victory is within our grasp!

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,260
[Note: Spoof of GUNDAM series anime.]

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,550
We shall get revenge on

8
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,260
that lawless bunch for besmirching
our Chief's name. Let me say this.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,230
They are all scum!

10
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,350
In the name of the moon...

11
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,840
[Note: Spoof of Sailor Moon.]

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,840
we will punish them!!

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,480
Hey, who's that? Who's making
that silly speech?

14
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,300
Who am I? I'm Shinsengumi
Vice-Chief...

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,210
Toshiro Hijikata nari!!

16
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,210
[Note: Suffix "Nari" was used by Samurai and by
Korosuke in the Kiteretsu Daihyakka anime.]

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,620
Hijikata-san...

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,790
Mr. Kondo, we shall protect your life.

19
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,090
In return, you have an obligation to fulfill.

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,010
To not die. Do whatever it takes to live.

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,660
No matter how humiliating it may be...

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,370
No matter how many squad members
die before your eyes, you must live!

23
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,050
As long as you're here,

24
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,350
the Shinsengumi is not finished.

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,460
We joined the Shinsengumi because we
wanted to be with you...

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,030
You're an idiot.

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,950
Don't think about such difficult things!

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,610
You should live the way you want to live.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,230
We just have to protect
you from everyone.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,290
Kondo-san...

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,580
You are the soul of the Shinsengumi.

32
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,580
We are the sword that protects you.

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,400
Toshi...

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,850
You broke once before.
What can you protect?

35
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,550
Hijikata-kun, it seems we have
to settle things between us.

36
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,060
I have a sword right here.
One that cuts very well.

37
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,850
Odd Jobs, I heard your rotten sermon!

38
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,890
What is it?

39
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,310
Don't talk as if you're so high and mighty.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,210
Draw it already!

41
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,480
Shut up!

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,170
I have one more thing to say to you.

43
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,840
Thank you!!

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,850
Hey, hey, it looks like the demonic sword
devoured him again... Toshi?

45
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,130
Is that Toshi?

46
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm...

47
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,530
[Toshiro Hijikata has fought off the demonic
sword's curse and recovered all by himself.]

48
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,030
[The moment to settle things with his
rival, Kamotaro Ito, has finally come.]

49
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:22,070
["Important Things Are Hard To See"]

50
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,550
If you want to kill our boss,
you have to defeat me first.

51
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,590
I won't let anyone past me. I won't
let anyone disgrace our souls.

52
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,220
I am the final fort that
protects Isao Kondo.

53
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,320
I am the final sword that protects
the Shinsengumi.

54
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,220
I am Shinsengumi Vice-Chief...

55
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,470
Toshiro Hijikata!!

56
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,810
He fought off the demonic
sword's curse by himself.

57
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,640
Sorry, Gorilla.

58
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,670
Unfortunately, we can't take your request
no matter how much money you offer us.

59
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,750
He was our client first.

60
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,660
Didn't your job end already?

61
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm going to be charging overtime pay!

62
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,550
Come on, Ito!

63
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,190
It changed... The rhythm of that
man's soul has changed.

64
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,660
It went from a childish anime song
to a sturdy rock-and-roll tune.

65
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,200
I guess the same goes
for you, too, Ito-dono.

66
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,210
You've gone from very dignified classical
music to fierce heavy metal.

67
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,680
That's a nice song... Play your beautiful
concerto to your heart's content.

68
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,680
Hijikata!!

69
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,350
Ito!!

70
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,700
The steering wheel...!

71
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,840
Hey, behind us!!

72
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,260
Kondo-san, move over
to this side already.

73
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,220
I overworked myself a bit... I'm
getting overtime pay for this, right?

74
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,220
Sogo?!

75
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,030
I'll make sure you negotiate with
the person in charge of our pay.

76
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,560
That's good. Also, make
sure to take care of him.

77
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,090
I'm a little tired...

78
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,700
Hijikata-san, if you come out even
a little behind, I'll kill you.

79
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,710
The next time you show
weakness, I'll take...

80
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,630
your position as Vice-Chief.

81
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,720
But are you saying that I should
just leave Toshi and run away?

82
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Don't waste your time!!

83
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,520
Don't fight here!!

84
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,800
Why are you using me like
a bridge as if it's normal?!

85
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,790
Gin-san!

86
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,930
Hijikata-kun, you were the only
one who understood me.

87
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,390
Unfortunately, you knew and feared my
potential and we became enemies.

88
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:29,370
If you were Chief, I might have
never planned this rebellion.

89
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,590
This is just hypothetical, though.

90
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,020
But there's one thing you've
got wrong about me.

91
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,780
Just as you know my potential,
I also know your potential.

92
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,680
Toshiro Hijikata, bring it on!!

93
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,150
This is the final showdown!!

94
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,120
You have an interesting sound.

95
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,760
Your sound is haphazard, willful,
and vague. It's akin to jazz.

96
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:34,000
But it's undignified. If anything,
it's a drunk's humming.

97
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,260
You bastard... You're the guy
who was with Takasugi.

98
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,040
Hey, take your headphones off
when you talk to someone.

99
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,840
Gintoki Sakata... No, White Knight...

100
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,440
Why are you with the Shinsengumi?

101
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,760
You can hear me, can't you?

102
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,270
That man seems to be
under your influence.

103
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,260
Are you planning to spy on the Bakufu
once you take control of the Shinsengumi?

104
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:14,270
We're not generous enough to be allied
with those who easily betray others.

105
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,940
We also know that people will not gather
under a person who has been unfaithful.

106
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,390
So what of that man?

107
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,280
He is a pitiful man.

108
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,620
By the time he realizes his
capacity, it'll be too late.

109
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,040
It'll be after everything
breaks into pieces.

110
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,360
Go to sleep, Ito...

111
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,340
Along with the Shinsengumi...

112
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,010
Geniuses are always alone. I have
no one who understands me.

113
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,010
I shouldn't remain in a place like this.

114
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,050
No one understands that. No
one realizes my true worth.

115
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,170
In that case,

116
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,050
I just have to demonstrate my potential
to take control of the country.

117
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,620
I will take control of the Shinsengumi.

118
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,080
I will use that as a foundation
to take control of the country.

119
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,740
I, Kamotaro Ito, will take control of the
country as proof that I have lived.

120
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,600
I will etch that into people's hearts.

121
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,680
You don't mind acquiring
a bad reputation?

122
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,700
In order to achieve what you propose,

123
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,600
you have to wipe out Kondo,
whom you are indebted to.

124
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,430
Indebted? Kondo's the one who
should be indebted to me.

125
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,780
I'm working for an incompetent
man like him.

126
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,610
He should be thankful. He has no
reason to be dissatisfied with me.

127
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,870
Ito, you're the kind of person

128
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,620
who thinks that everyone aside from
yourself is stupid, aren't you?

129
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:19,300
But you're unsatisfied that those stupid
people don't understand you.

130
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,630
You want them to understand you.
You want them to acknowledge you.

131
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,630
You want to prove your worth?
It's not that difficult.

132
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,640
You choose to be all by yourself.

133
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,830
You don't want someone who
understands and accepts you.

134
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,380
What you really want is...

135
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,120
Where am I?

136
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,420
Hijikata?

137
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,070
I see... I won! I finally
won against Hijikata...

138
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,710
Shinsuke saw through Ito.

139
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,070
He is a show-off who has more
pride than anyone else

140
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,620
and doesn't know his own worth.

141
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,520
It was easy to provoke and use him.

142
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,870
As expected, the Shinsengumi members
fought against each other

143
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,130
and depleted their fighting potential.

144
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,860
You were planning to use him to crush
the Shinsengumi to begin with.

145
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,110
You acted as if you were helping
with Ito's rebellion.

146
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,380
While you were really planning
to annihilate the Shinsengumi

147
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,510
when it was exhausted after they
fought amongst themselves.

148
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,980
It's a death that suits that
man, don't you think?

149
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,570
The traitor is wiped out by the traitor.

150
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,560
S-Stop!

151
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,280
Stop!

152
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,470
I'm not meant to die in a place like this.

153
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,440
Stop. I can do much better...

154
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,560
Much, much better...

155
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,670
Mother!

156
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,150
Take a look! I got a perfect
score on a test at school.

157
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,320
Kamotaro, be quiet. It's bad for
your older brother's health.

158
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,460
I-I'm very sorry.

159
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,930
I've got to try much, much harder.

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,400
If I try harder, I'm sure she'll notice me.

161
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,110
Yes. That's wonderful, Kamotaro!

162
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,290
You are the first child prodigy
to come from our school.

163
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,160
Everyone, don't lose to Kamotaro.

164
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,670
Don't get cocky.

165
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,920
You're just a rich kid who
only knows how to study!

166
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,930
I've got to try much, much harder.

167
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,680
If I try harder, I'm sure that
everyone will accept me.

168
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,340
One point! Wonderful. You're
really something, Kamo!

169
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,230
Such an aptitude for swords at your age.

170
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,080
You worked hard, didn't you?

171
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,820
Kamo, go to Edo.

172
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,330
I'll recommend you to the dojo of the
distinguished Hokuto Itto Style.

173
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,830
Your brilliance will go to waste
out here in the country!

174
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,290
It's possible you might even surpass the
great swordsman Musashi Miyamoto!

175
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,160
Why?

176
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,530
[Letter of Recommendation]

177
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:48,530
Honestly. My heir, Takahisa is so sickly.

178
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,040
I wonder what's going to
happen to the Ito family.

179
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Kamotaro grew up so healthily.

180
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,750
No matter how brilliant our second
son is, it's just a waste of talent.

181
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,380
Takahisa wasn't born to have everything
taken away from him by Kamotaro.

182
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,550
I'm sure Kamotaro took everything away
from Takahisa while he was in my womb.

183
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,560
I wish he was never born.

184
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,910
Hey! What if Kamotaro hears you?!
What's the matter with you?!

185
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,660
I feel so sorry for Takahisa.

186
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,920
When I see Kamotaro carelessly
running about...

187
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,900
You must be tired from taking
care of Takahisa.

188
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,370
Go to bed already.

189
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,700
Why? Why doesn't anyone look at me?

190
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,840
I've tried so hard. I'm not at fault.

191
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,250
Look at me. Praise me.

192
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,510
Don't leave me alone.

193
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,830
Stay by me. By my side.

194
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,330
Hold this hand...

195
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,210
K-Kondo?!

196
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,890
What are you doing?

197
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,890
Do you know what you're
doing right now?!

198
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,730
I'm the traitor who tried to kill you.

199
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,960
The boss is at fault if there's a revolt.

200
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,420
Soldiers will lose their lives if they
stay with an incompetent general.

201
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,270
They're not at fault for killing him.

202
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,440
Sorry. I'm not a good enough
general to be your superior.

203
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,150
I was never suited to be the boss.

204
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,460
You're far more suited to be the boss.

205
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,730
I can't stand by while squad
members are dying.

206
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,500
I can't ever use suicide squads.

207
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:54,070
Sensei, I'm not a soldier.

208
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,990
But I wanted you to be by my side as
a friend that I would pour drinks with.

209
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,830
There were still so many things I wanted
you to teach me, Sensei...

210
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,710
It's not my fault I'm alone! I'm not at fault!

211
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,300
They're incompetent!
They're completely incompetent!

212
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:22,320
We live in different worlds.
I was a chosen individual.

213
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,320
I couldn't accept my loneliness and
I blamed my loneliness on others.

214
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,330
I was afraid that people would
reject me, so I rejected them.

215
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,630
I was afraid I would get hurt, so
I acted as if I liked being alone.

216
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,420
I built a wall around my heart.

217
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,970
But my lingering desire for attention
grew stronger by the day.

218
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,570
I wanted to be accepted by others.

219
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,810
Even when I was accepted,
I wasn't satisfied.

220
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,640
I could do better. I'm not like them.

221
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,280
I'll show them who I am.

222
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,040
You don't want someone who
understands and accepts you.

223
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,500
I had forgotten what I really wanted.

224
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:12,800
It wasn't power, fame, military exploits, talent,
or someone who understood me.

225
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,730
I just wanted someone to be by my side.

226
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,310
I just wanted someone to see me.

227
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,980
I just didn't want to be alone anymore.

228
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,990
I just wanted...

229
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,790
Sensei!

230
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,360
Friends who would accept
me for who I was.

231
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,670
Hey, look over there!

232
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,000
What are you doing?!

233
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,240
Hurry up and run away!

234
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,790
Someone who would
look directly at me...

235
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,770
Someday, I'll kill you.

236
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,760
And take me head on.

237
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,990
I just...

238
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,500
Wanted friends.

239
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,000
The thing I wanted...

240
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,560
Was something...

241
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,790
I already had.

242
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,510
Hijikata-kun, I have something
I want to say to you.

243
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,510
What a coincidence. Me, too.

244
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,380
I hate you.

245
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,350
Someday, I'll kill you. So...

246
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,090
Don't die here.

247
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,200
The bond I wanted so much...

248
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,940
Was right here all along.

249
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,160
I can't see your swings or your rhythm!

250
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,230
Out of the way, damn it!!

251
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,400
Don't you understand that...

252
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm telling you to get out of my way?!

253
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,020
I don't have the time

254
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,210
to deal with...

255
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,340
idiots like you!

256
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,160
Strings?!

257
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,380
You shouldn't push yourself.
Your arms and legs will rip off.

258
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,890
Even if you go to help
them now, it's too late.

259
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,860
Do you think your friends are still alive?

260
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,660
Even if they survived that explosion...

261
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,360
We've taken many measures.

262
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,270
The Shinsengumi will disappear.

263
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,640
I told you that your arms
and legs will rip off.

264
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,770
Who'd want to go and save their sorry asses?

265
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,280
I can't stop. My body won't listen to me.

266
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,330
It's being pulled forward.

267
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,350
Strings are pulling me from
the front and the back.

268
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,790
It annoys me to no end...

269
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,300
These strings are as strong
as steel, but still...

270
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,990
You can have an arm and a leg or two...

271
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,400
Even if these strings can cut flesh...

272
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,410
I'd like to see them

273
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,870
try to sever

274
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,200
an obnoxious bond!

275
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,820
Get down!

276
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,800
Sensei!

277

I've never once fought for the
sake of this cheap country.
