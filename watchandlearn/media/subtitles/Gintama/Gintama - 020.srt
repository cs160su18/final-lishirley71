00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,070
[The Shinsengumi are sharing ghost stories to cool off at night. Inayama-san's story is "Woman in a Red Kimono."]

3
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,080
[A cursed voice is heard at midnight. What did Hijikata see?!]

4
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,800
It was a very hot night with many mosquitoes, like tonight...

5
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,570
I was setting off fireworks with my friends and noticed it had gotten dark.

6
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,490
So, I thought my mom would get upset and kick me if I didn't get home right away.

7
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,880
I decided to go home.

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,290
We cleaned up the exploded fireworks and glanced at the Temple School.

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,390
Then, although it was midnight,

10
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,680
a woman in a red kimono was looking right at me from the window of the Temple School.

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,260
I was shocked, but I wanted to find out more.

12
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,210
So I gingerly asked her what she was doing up this late.

13
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,790
And she...

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,880
...smiled at me and said...

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,370
We've run out of mayonnaise!!

16
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,590
Vice-chief!! What the heck-?! You ruined the ending!!

17
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,810
I don't care about that! The mayonnaise ran out! I told you to buy more.

18
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,110
Yakisoba's no good without it!!

19
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,530
You've had enough, already!

20
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,530
That doesn't look like Yakisoba anymore! It's "Yaki-mayonnaise" now!

21
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh, Chief!

22
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,070
Chief!!

23
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,850
My goodness! Chief!

24
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,820
The mayonnaise made him faint!

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,610
It's terrible!

26
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,560
That's so stupid! They're all obsessed with ghost stories.

27
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,040
There's no way that ghosts exist.

28
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,150
Man, there're so many mosquitoes these days.

29
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,390
Die...

30
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,960
Die...Die...Hijikata...

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,690
Please, die...

32
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,150
It can't be...

33
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,930
What are you doing here at this time of night?

34
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,530
Jo...Jogging.

35
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,460
You liar!

36
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,990
If you ran around in that kind of outfit, your head would catch fire!

37
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,810
Were you holding a ritual? You were holding a ritual for killing me, weren't you?!

38
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,950
You're really self-consciousness.

39
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,440
If you think like that, you'll suffer a nervous breakdown.

40
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,560
What?!

41
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,550
What's the matter with you, Hijikata-san?

42
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,430
Sogo, did you just see something over there?

43
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,770
Nothing really...

44
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,350
I thought I just saw...

45
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,300
["Watch Out for Conveyor Belts!"]

46
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,920
That's terrible...

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,190
Hey, how many people so far?

48
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,000
Eighteen troops.

49
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,440
So over half the squad has been struck down.

50
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,570
I've got to admit... This is getting kind of eerie.

51
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,120
No kidding. We, the Shinsengumi, were brought to our knees by a ghost,

52
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,590
Everyone flat on their backs. It's mortifying! I can't even tell anyone about it.

53
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,950
The shame!

54
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,070
Toshi...

55
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,590
I wasn't beaten by a ghost.
I was beaten by mayonnaise!

56
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,140
That's even worse.

57
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,840
Everybody is making delirious sounds about the woman in the red kimono.

58
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,600
Is that the same ghost Inayama-san was talking about the other night?

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,150
Idiot! There's no such thing as ghosts.

60
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,250
Don't underestimate ghosts, or you'll be in real trouble, Toshi.

61
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,200
This building is cursed. It must be possessed by a horrible spirit.

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,570
What are you talking about?!

63
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,730
No, never.

64
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,350
Chief, here they are.

65
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,210
Oh, thanks, Yamazaki!

66
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,950
I found these exorcists downtown.

67
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,960
Hello.

68
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,690
Who are these guys? Is the circus in town?

69
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,790
No, they're here for a exorcising.

70
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,650
Hey, hey! Are you kidding?

71
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,650
These guys look so shady.

72
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,480
Oh? Your back...

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,130
What...? There's something on my back?

74
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,670
He's done for with that on him.

75
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,000
What are they doing? Can I stab these jokers? Huh, can I?

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,870
Sensei, can you help us? I'm too scared to go to the bathroom by myself.

77
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,700
We'll take care of it, gorilla.

78
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,030
Huh? Did you just say "gorilla"? You just said gorilla, right?

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,120
We looked around the house.

80
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,980
And I feel a fairly powerful spirit presence, gorilla.

81
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,650
Ah, you definitely said "gorilla," didn't you?

82
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,710
For starters, why don't we do an exorcism?

83
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,340
This is going to cost you a pretty penny, gorilla.

84
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,860
Hey, hey, they're getting in the habit of saying "gorilla."

85
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,030
By the way, what kind of spirit is here, gorilla?

86
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,400
It's contagious!

87
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,700
Um... A factory foreman.

88
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,370
Well, it's the spirit of a factory foreman who died after getting stuck in a conveyer belt.

89
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,050
But everyone said they saw a woman's spirit.

90
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,890
Oh right!

91
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,000
It's the spirit of a woman who looked like the factory foreman who killed herself

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,220
by getting stuck in a conveyer belt.

93
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,930
That explanation's too long! And what does a factory foreman have to do with it?!

94
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,500
Anyway, are you Yamazaki?

95
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,460
We must borrow your body. To draw in the spirit, and then exorcise it, okay?

96
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,830
Eh... W-Wait a minute.

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,610
Wait... "Exorcise"... How are you gonna do that?

98
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,570
We'll just hit you really hard.

99
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,030
Hey, anybody can do that!

100
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,280
Yes! It went into him. A spirit went into him, here!

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,690
Looked to me like you delivered a body blow instead of putting a spirit in.

102
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,910
No, I went into him.

103
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,990
Well, this factory will be destroyed today, and it's all my fault...

104
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,460
Hey! It's the factory foreman!

105
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,440
Oh? What was the story again?

106
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,800
Idiot! It's about a woman who died after getting stuck in a conveyer belt.

107
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,870
There's no way a woman would get stuck in a conveyer belt.

108
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,710
A conveyer belt... Oh? What type?

109
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,190
Never mind! Just act like a normal woman!

110
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,240
No way!

111
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,840
Playing a normal woman may look easy, but it's the most difficult acting there is!

112
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,620
Nobody expects that level of realism!

113
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,840
Shut up, mummy man! Your outfit is what's unrealistic!

114
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,360
Say that again?! I thought I look mysterious like this.

115
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,060
Oh, no! Cut it out, you guys!

116
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,490
We're on duty! Hey, are you listening to me?

117
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,730
Both of you!

118
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,950
Ah.

119
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,540
We didn't mean any harm. We didn't have a job.

120
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,530
We just thought exorcising ghosts might be a good job

121
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,470
to make money because it's summer and it's blazing hot in town.

122
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,370
Right, Gin-san?

123
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,110
Right. I've been able to see spirits for a long time,

124
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,080
so I wanted to use my special talent to help people.

125
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,850
Oh, I see an angry old granny behind you.

126
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,140
Really? She must be the granny who owned the candy store.

127
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,470
I made fake winning tickets to get ice cream lots of times.

128
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,960
I cheated her, so she must still be mad at me. What should I do?

129
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,610
Don't worry. She said if you release all of us and give us water, she'll forgive you.

130
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,120
All right. Then drink this up through your nose.

131
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,150
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
What's this nostalgic feeling?!

132
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,520
Like when I was a kid and almost drowned in the swimming pool!

133
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,560
Gin-chan, I feel like my head is going to explode... Help me!

134
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,440
Hey! An innocent girl says her head is going to explode!

135
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,170
Are you guys sure you want the show to finish like this?!

136
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,630
Next week, We'll start "Shinsengumi: Wind of Blood Chronicles"! Don't miss it!

137
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,680
They're going to kill us.

138
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Somebody, help me!

139
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:35,090
Hey, Toshi, cut them down. Otherwise, Sogo will discover the joys of sadism.

140
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:41,190
What are you talking about? He's a prince from a sadistic planet. It's too late.

141
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,760
I don't feel so good.

142
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,220
Normally we'd beat you and cut you in strips...

143
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,310
But we're so busy we have no time for that these days. So just leave.

144
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,490
Ah, they're scared of ghosts.

145
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,180
Poor babies. Want mommy to stand and guard while you go potty?

146
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,440
Are you ridiculing a samurai?!

147
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,390
Please come with me to the bathroom.

148
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,280
I can't believe that you're asking!

149
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,430
Well, I was holding off on a trip to the bathroom because I'm scared.

150
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,470
Okay, let's go.

151
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,160
All right.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,410
Hey, are you that scared?

153
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,530
You wanna seriously live your life like that? Hey!

154
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:31,170
You, please keep quiet about this. I'm begging you.

155
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,370
It looks like you guys really are in trouble. Are you all right?

156
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,150
It's so shameful...

157
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,930
I never thought my army would be so petrified of ghosts like this.

158
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,960
If it's something we can see, we can fight it with our swords,

159
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,980
but I have no idea what to do against something we can't see.

160
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,200
Huh? What? You believe in ghosts?

161
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,880
Ow! Ow! Help, Mommy! It's the man who injured his head, over here!

162
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,290
I'll kill you someday.

163
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,560
Don't tell me you saw the woman in the red kimono.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,050
I can't tell for sure.

165
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,360
But I saw something strange.

166
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,120
I don't think it was human.

167
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,540
Ow! Ow! Help! Daddy!

168
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,510
Bring me a Band-Aid! The size that can wrap around a whole person!

169
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,600
Did you guys rehearse this or something?!

170
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,610
A woman in a red kimono...

171
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,730
It reminds me of a ghost story...

172
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:36,380
At the Temple School I used to go to...that story got passed around a lot.

173
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,630
Let's see... One evening, a student was playing at school.

174
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,360
Wait for me! I'm begging you... just wait for me.

175
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,960
Don't make a mess!

176
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,420
Nobody was supposed to be in the school building at that time, but...

177
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,360
So many mosquitoes around...

178
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,820
...a woman wearing a kimono appeared.

179
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,610
And he asked her what she was doing...

180
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,650
Gorilla, what's wrong? Got caught in your zipper?

181
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,590
Kagura, what happened?!

182
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,080
He got caught in his zipper.

183
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,560
Get out of my way!

184
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,400
How did he end up like that?

185
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,160
Uh... W-W-Woman in the red kimono...

186
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,770
Uh... Sh-She's coming!

187
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,170
Kondo-san! Pull yourself together!

188
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,390
Talking in his sleep...and at his age, too.

189
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,070
Well, you know... He's probably dreaming of a woman he made cry a long time ago.

190
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,210
A woman might have made Kondo cry, but he's never made a woman cry.

191
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,040
Then the woman that made you cry has come back to complain some more.

192
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,410
I'd never been with a bad woman like that before.

193
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,520
I see. Then what?

194
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,380
Heck if I know.

195
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,620
But I can tell you that there's something strange going on in this building.

196
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,090
I think that's a ghost.

197
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,260
Ah? I don't believe in unscientific things like ghosts.

198
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,590
Though I believe in the Lost Continent of Mu.

199
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,420
That's nonsense. It's too much trouble. Let's go home.

200
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,320
Gin-san...

201
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,430
What're you doing?

202
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,280
Hey!

203
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,050
I thought you guys were frightened so I was trying to help you.

204
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,300
Gin-chan, your hands are all sweaty and gross.

205
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,380
Ah? What are you talking about?!

206
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,980
Ah! The woman in the red kimono!

207
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,150
What are you doing, Gin-san?

208
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,360
Well, the entrance to Mu...

209
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,160
Say, tough guy... Are you afraid of...a ghost...?

210
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,560
What?

211
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,000
Hijikata-san, this guy... Oh?

212
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,610
Hijikata-san, what are you doing?

213
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,450
Well, the entrance to Mayonnaise Kingdom...

214
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,990
Wait, wait, wait! Don't get me wrong!

215
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,660
He may be afraid, but not me.

216
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,460
You're the one who's afraid!

217
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,060
I just got an urge to return to the womb, is all!

218
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:49,030
All right, all right. You just go to Mu or Mayonnaise Kingdom or wherever.

219
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,590
What does your contemptuous look mean?

220
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,030
What's that?

221
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,740
Hmph. If you're trying to scare us again, forget it.

222
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,360
The same trick doesn't work twice.

223
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,080
Hey, come on-you're taking this joke too far.

224
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,490
Man, they really put a lot of effort into that put-down.

225
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,270
Prankster kids...

226
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,320
You can't deceive us.

227
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,970
G-Good evening.

228
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,710
I-I-I saw her! She was real! She was real!

229
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,210
Gin-chan!

230
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,790
Forget about them. They're doomed.

231
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,820
Th...they made it.

232
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,850
...Wait a minute.

233
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,250
They're carrying her! They're carrying the woman!

234
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,160
Get awaaaay!

235
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,310
Hey! Why are you running from us?!

236
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,090
Oh? Hold on. Do you feel something heavy on your back?

237
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,070
I don't know! I have no idea!

238
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,740
I'm sure someone is on us; I feel something heavy.

239
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,470
Shut up. Why don't you check then?

240
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,530
Can't you just take a look at it?!

241
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,040
Hold on. Let's do this.

242
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,270
Let's both turn around and look at the same time.

243
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,470
Just make sure you do it! Don't cheat me!

244
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,440
You definitely look back!

245
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,340
Here we go!

246
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,050
G-Good evening.

247
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,790
They died! They really died!

248
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,290
Yes! I'll finally be promoted to Vice-chief.

249
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,530
Whatever!

250
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,770
Hey, does anybody have a light? Oh, there's a mosquito coil.

251
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,910
What's that? What the hell is that?

252
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,140
Shinpachi, did Gin-chan die? Did he?

253
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,370
Well, I once tried to summon an evil spirit so Hijikata-san would die.

254
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,650
Maybe it's left over from back then...

255
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,650
How black is your soul, anyway?!

256
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,820
Are you the root of this evil? You bastard-I'll avenge Gin!

257
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,690
Hey, hey! Stop it! This place is too small for that!

258
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,990
Every time you see each other, why are you...

259
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,170
I-It's here! Sorry.

260
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry!

261
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,100
You guys apologize, too!

262
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,220
If you apologize from your heart by bowing your head, it will reach everyone, stupid!

263
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,100
Seriously! We'll even lick the soles of your shoes, so please forgive us.

264
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,190
I don't taste very good... I don't taste very good... I don't taste...

265
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,100
Oh! She's gone.

266
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,560
Wh-Why?

267
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,440
Stop with the annoying sound effects!

268
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,630
...You survived.

269
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,200
You must have the luck of the devil!

270
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,490
Wh-Where did the thing go?

271
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,110
Dunno. After the others probably.

272
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,110
It ran away...

273
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,360
You know what?

274
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,310
While I was being chased by it, I was giving it my "Badass" look.

275
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,690
I guess it worked.

276
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,310
Whatever. While I was being chased by it, I kept pinching that thing.

277
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,210
You're so small-minded...

278
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,250
Well, I had a nice swim and am all refreshed. It's time for a counterattack.

279
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,350
Don't try to act tough.
Your voice is quivering.

280
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,190
I'll take care of that thing. You go lay down, princess

281
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,810
I think you're the one who's frightened.

282
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,830
I know you hid in the pond because you already wet your pants, huh?!

283
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,980
What?! I'll exorcise you before I get that ghost!

284
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,680
I owe you a lot, so I'll pay you back with interest!

285
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,220
Huh? Did I lend you something? Don't worry, you can keep it!

286
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,390
I already bought a new NES game.

287
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,290
Shut up, already!!

288
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,010
Just as I expected.

289
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,890
This man...

290
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,500
and this man, as well as this one...

291
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,300
All these men, who were hit by ghosts, have huge mosquito bites...

292
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,090
That is...

293
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,340
not a ghost.

294
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,810
H-H-Hey! What the heck was that?!

295
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,430
It's f-f-flying!

296
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:56,010
H-H-Hey, are you scared?

297
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,930
N-N-No way! Who do you think I am?

298
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,310
I'm not scared!

299
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,800
All right. You be the bait.

300
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,950
Then I'll...do that...

301
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,970
Hey! What does "that" mean? Escape? Are you going to skip out?

302
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,800
N-No way. Um...I'm going to shoot it with a bazooka.

303
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,030
Where's the bazooka?

304
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,630
Everyone has a bazooka in their heart.

305
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,400
You just can't escape.

306
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,090
Hey, what are you doing?!

307
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,040
Running from an enemy goes against Bushido principles.

308
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,770
You had better study the code from scratch.

309
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,790
What the hell are you doing?!

310
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,760
You'll need another hundred years to tell me about the way of the samurai.

311
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,880
Oh?

312
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,860
Well, I'm sorry for what I did.

313
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,500
I'm an Amanto. I'm like an earth mosquito.

314
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,220
I got pregnant with my boss at work.

315
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,970
And I needed energy for the delivery.

316
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,640
He has a family, so I decided to raise my baby myself.

317
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,170
I was looking for blood and found the perfect place full of hot-blooded men, so...

318
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,540
I'm really sorry.

319
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,890
But I wanted to be strong. I wanted to be strong enough to raise my baby!

320
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,080
Sorry, but can you stop making that horrible face?

321
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,190
...Anyway, it doesn't matter whether it's a ghost or a mosquito.

322
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,530
It's another pain in the butt to everyone.

323
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,640
You're a pain in the butt!

324
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm not going to give you any reward. Just leave.

325
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,890
But don't forget that it was my final blow that solved everything.

326
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,970
What are you talking about?

327
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,540
I made a blow before you, and that solved everything.

328
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,550
I handled it without your help.

329
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,910
Yeah, you sure talk big-but you were shaking in your boots.

330
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:23,860
Who would believe the terrifying Vice-chief is scared of ghosts?

331
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,720
You know, I was not scared. I was just startled.

332
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,980
It's a huge difference.

333
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,870
I bet you were really scared.

334
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,820
You know, I was pretending that I was following the scripts.

335
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,370
Actually, I prefer doing it like this. Let's do it every week...

336
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,380
Gin-chan, it's time to go...

337
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,670
What are you two doing?

338
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,170
Well, I dropped my contact...

339
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:36,050
[Preview]

340
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,630
It's hot! Hot!

341
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,140
Why do I have to get sweaty working to buy a fan?!

342
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,240
I'm here to get something to cool down, but I'm getting hotter!

343
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,700
The next episode is: "If You Go to Sleep with the Fan On You'll Get a Stomachache, So Be Careful."

344
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,630
[Also, the Odd Jobs go fishing. "If You're a Man, Try the Swordfish!"]

345
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:50,070
[But what they caught was a Kappa, the master of the lake? Ebina-san? What the... He actually has a name?!]

346
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,710
Finally, I've got enough mayonnaise!
