51
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,539
The plane crash victims' bodies were cut into pieces

52
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,585
and grafted onto a single boy.

53
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:42,519
And that boy was Kamui?

54
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:49,561
He has said himself that he has the 
flesh and personalities of 184 people,

55
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,507
including seven people's brains.

56
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:56,529
I'm amazed a multi-body brain transplant was even possible.

57
00:00:56,554 --> 00:01:01,508
To be honest, the chance of success was all but zero.

58
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:04,500
If I were asked to do it again, I would probably fail.

59
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:05,546
However...

60
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,567
That boy has lived on

61
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:12,505
as someone whose Psycho-Pass cannot be measured at all.

62
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,514
After all,

63
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:17,577
in the scanners' eyes, he's nothing but a jumble of corpses.

64
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:20,581
So that's who Kamui Kirito is.

65
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:22,502

66
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:43,070
I will go insane

67
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,504
if the world keeps ruining my life

68
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:45,554
I've stopped breathing

69
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:48,513
from the nervousness every day

70
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:50,505
Enigmatic feeling

71
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:58,597
I have to be the aggressor

72
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:01,564
The world has stopped making sense

73
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,552
It's dissolving

74
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:05,565
God has come to us

75
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:08,507
with sword in hand

76
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:12,590
The world has split in two

77
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,570
Half is mad,

78
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,570
and so am I

79
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,537
Where's the difference?

80
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:19,595
Where's the difference?

81
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:23,521
Only God can walk the borderline

82
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,588
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

83
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:30,542
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

84
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:33,555
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

85
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:36,584
I have no focus in my soul

86
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:40,547
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

87
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:43,552
I can't even look into the mirror

88
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,511
At the conclusion of the surgery,

89
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:59,516
he was still a normal human that scanners were able to recognize.

90
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,503
conception of 
the oracle

91
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,503
conception of 
the oracle

92
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,503
conception of 
the oracle

93
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,503
conception of 
the oracle

94
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,503
conception of 
the oracle

95
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,503
conception of 
the oracle

96
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,503
conception of 
the oracle

97
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,503
conception of 
the oracle

98
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,503
conception of 
the oracle

99
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,503
conception of 
the oracle

100
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,503
conception of 
the oracle

101
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,503
conception of 
the oracle

102
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:15,534
He told me that he realized his uniqueness

103
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:18,580
after he was able to return to a normal daily life.

104
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:21,576
The more his body accepted the grafted parts,

105
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:25,573
the less often he was recognized by scanners.

106
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,523
As time passed,

107
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:32,523
I soon became a ghost who was cut off from society.

108
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,578
To begin with, I did try to be recognized.

109
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:40,558
At times, I would purposefully commit crimes in broad daylight, hoping to be judged.

110
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:46,562
I also consulted people I thought I could trust, 
including doctors and counselors.

111
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:50,508
But when they saw my uniqueness with their own eyes,

112
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:51,559
they walked away.

113
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,584
I can imagine.

114
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:56,567
Acknowledging someone who isn't recognized by Sibyl

115
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:59,559
is tantamount to doubting the very foundation of this society.

116
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,560
I'm not only invisible to Sibyl.

117
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,560
No one dependent on this system will acknowledge my existence.

118
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,506
Why did I have to fade away like a ghost, forsaken by society?

119
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:13,545
While searching for the answer to that question, I discovered...

120
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:16,507
the Season of Hell.

121
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,549
I knew you'd be no stranger to that incident.

122
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,545
I've only heard of it. That's all.

123
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:29,512
At one time, the Ministry of Economy proposed a support system for citizens to replace Sibyl, leading to controversy.

124
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:33,574
It would control the traffic and banks, supervising all of them.

125
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,538
It was called “Panopticon."

126
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:42,542
The original Panopticon was a system that allowed one to monitor everything from one place.

127
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,564
It was an architectural form designed as a detention facility by Jeremy Bentham.

128
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:50,506
By monitoring and recording people's actions and economic activities,

129
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:54,519
it would prevent crimes before they happened, 
guiding citizens toward the best way of living.

130
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,511
It was quite a simple proposal, 
but you could also call it the ideal solution.

131
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,553
Ideal, huh?

132
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:04,533
If you need to monitor everything your citizens do, 
they might as well be in prison.

133
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,569
And how is that any different from our current society?

134
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:09,566
Let's get back on track.

135
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:13,558
They began test deployments of Panopticon for traffic monitoring.

136
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:18,551
But did you know it soon suffered a series of crippling malfunctions?

137
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,597
Yeah. And that's when they shelved the wider adoption of the system.

138
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:23,589
Indeed.

139
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,593
And so, Sybil's rule has continued until today.

140
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:31,527
But what if someone had intended for that to happen?

141
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,569
What if everything had been set up in order to ensure that result?

142
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:38,557
I recall hearing conspiracy theories like those at the time, too.

143
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,570
Conspiracy theories? Don't make me laugh.

144
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:44,582
Interference with the Ministry of Economy, 
manipulation and draining of valuable human resources,

145
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,533
the scramble for a budget,

146
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,541
backroom dealings amongst politicians...

147
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,579
Those things really did happen.

148
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,529
In fact, as a result...

149
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,596
The number of plane crashes and traffic accidents around that time

150
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:59,563
were dozens of times higher than average.

151
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:04,572
A large number of people were victimized during that time.

152
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,560
It came to be known as the Season of Hell.

153
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:10,573
So you found your answer there.

154
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:14,556
I learned all I needed and discovered what I had to do.

155
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,541
Then I became a present-day medicine man.

156
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,599
It was about five years ago that I was reunited with him.

157
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:25,599
My excessive stress at the time had left me dependent on medication.

158
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,500
The cause was simple.

159
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,595
My mind couldn't endure the 
heavy responsibility of a doctor.

160
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:35,529
A trite story that I'm sure you've heard many times before.

161
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:40,538
Kamui healed me.

162
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:45,501
He had obtained the medical data that we were forbidden to see

163
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,544
and gained the ability to clear 
people's Psycho-Passes

164
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:51,552
by teaching them how to meditate 
and providing them with appropriate medication.

165
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:55,556
So he can clear the Psycho-Pass of any criminal, eh?

166
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:58,548
That alone would allow him to exact revenge for his past.

167
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,523
He won't stop at simple revenge.

168
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:04,511
Kamui will overturn everything for us.

169
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:08,553
Thanks to him, we can dream of something bigger.

170
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,558
He'll overturn everything?

171
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:12,554
Is that Kamui's goal?

172
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,500
I understand now.

173
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,596
It's not just me you want to judge,

174
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:22,592
but the entire Sibyl System, is it, Kirito?

175
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:26,588
A human put together from the flesh of countless corpses?

176
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:28,564
That's disgusting.

Uchikoga Shunji

202
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:38,523
Who's this?

203
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:44,544
There he is.

204
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:45,570
One of Kamui's Holos.

205
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:49,503
So Kamui came here?

206
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:52,562
Where's Inspector Shimotsuki?

207
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:56,529
She said she'd continue checking medical institutions for clues.

208
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:57,592
Okay.

209
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:01,575
In that case, why don't we all give our status reports?

210
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:03,567
I'll go first, then.

211
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:08,522
I searched for people with the same names as the accident victims

212
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,518
and found fifty-four matches 
within the inner-city area alone.

213
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,531
Those fifty-four people...

214
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:19,515
No, it's probably safe to say that all 184 victims excluding Kamui

215
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:22,515
are the Holos that he wears.

216
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:23,515
Yes.

217
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:25,557
The therapist who offered his services at the Bureau,

218
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:28,511
the pharmacist at the mental care facility,

219
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,532
and the hostage from the first incident...

220
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:33,508
were all Kamui.

221
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:39,508
B-But this might also mean that h-he only uses the Holos of those victims.

222
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:41,567
Yes, I agree.

223
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:46,580
Kamui is obsessed with the accident and the 184 people from which he received transplants as a result.

224
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:50,576
In that sense, we can say that we 
finally know the perpetrator's face.

225
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:52,572
How was your investigation, Ginoza?

226
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,572
Based on the organs left at Kamui's hideout,

227
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:58,589
we've determined the people who may have been replaced.

228
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:01,544
They were influential figures from every sector of society.

229
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:07,586
Dr. Masuzaki was the one who replaced these people with impostors.

230
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:09,561
He confessed to it himself.

231
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:12,528
He murdered them under the guise of treating them.

232
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:16,574
And yet he kept his Psycho-Pass clear even while performing such atrocities.

233
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:19,558
That is what makes Kamui unique.

234
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,579
With prepared medication and psychological counseling,

235
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:25,580
he can even clear even the Psycho-Passes of high-level latent criminals

236
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,567
to the extent that it could be called brainwashing.

237
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,534
Medical care is his most powerful weapon, huh?

238
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:31,543
How troublesome.

239
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:35,593
At the same time, he's limited his attacks to medical institutions.

240
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:39,535
Remember the claim of responsibility made by Kitazawa, the bomber?

241
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:43,527
H-He said he targeted a pharmaceutical company.

242
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:47,561
And the barricade incident happened at a mental care facility.

243
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:51,536
The strange thing is that he used the port as his hideout.

244
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:53,545
There must have been some advantage to doing so.

245
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,566
But what would that advantage be?

246
00:09:55,566 --> 00:10:00,537
Kunizuka, have there been any unsolved 
missing persons cases over the past few months?

247
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,596
I don't think there's anything on the record.

248
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:06,538
Isn't that strange? From what we know, people must have gone missing.

249
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:07,542
I agree.

250
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,538
If the people killed for their organs were replaced by impostors,

251
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:13,534
the original identities of those impostors would also have had to disappear.

252
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:14,584
That is true.

253
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:18,531
So we're dealing with people whose 
disappearances aren't recognized by society.

254
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:19,527
Wait.

255
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:24,531
I recall seeing foreign newspapers 
and currencies left behind at the site.

256
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:26,581
I see. Illegal aliens.

257
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:30,573
So the impersonators are illegal aliens?

258
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,565
It's definitely a possibility.

259
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,578
What could he hope to achieve 
with such elaborate measures?

260
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,558
What do you want?

261
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,584
Can you afford to be loitering around here?

262
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:55,559
I didn't come to see you because I had too much free time on my hands.

263
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,577
Rather, I've been interested in you for some time.

264
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:03,577
Saiga Jouji, a lecturer who colored his students black.

265
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:06,540
I'm not exactly pleased about that.

266
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,586
Influencing the Psycho-Passes of others is no mean feat.

267
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,544
There has to be more to it than a simple trick.

268
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:18,528
Indeed. If anyone could learn to do it, 
this society wouldn't hold.

269
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:21,545
If it's not a trick, it must be a talent.

270
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:24,512
You have a talent for clouding a person's Psycho-Pass,

271
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:27,533
which is the exact opposite of Kamui's talent for clearing it.

272
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,579
Am I supposed to be proud of that or something?

273
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:32,538
And as a result,

274
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:38,543
you're dependent on Inspector Tsunemori, whose Psycho-Pass doesn't change no matter how much you get involved.

275
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:40,535
Oh?

276
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:45,564
Excuse me.

277
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:51,577
Understood.

278
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,553
Dependent, huh?

279
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:55,544
So what does that make you?

280
00:11:57,536 --> 00:11:58,545
You're sharp.

281
00:11:58,582 --> 00:11:59,599
Too sharp.

282
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:09,504
The data Kamui accessed is heavily focused on drug-related categories.

283
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:12,596
Such as the manufacturing technologies for the new drug LACOUSE,

284
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,517
Lacouse

285
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,517
Lacouse

286
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,517
Lacouse

287
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,517
Lacouse

288
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,517
Lacouse

289
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,517
Lacouse

290
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,517
Lacouse

291
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:16,501
which was related to the Kitazawa bombing incident.

292
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:20,559
There's also an access record for several drugs used at the mental care facility

293
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,581
where the barricade incident took place.

294
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:26,561
And the common link is...

295
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:27,523
Patent Owner: The Tougane Foundation

296
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:31,519
Could Kamui be trying to take revenge against the Tougane Foundation?

297
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:37,511
Their patented technologies were used in the surgery carried out after the plane crash.

298
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,508
Brain extraction from living subjects?

299
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:43,570
The grafting of multiple extracted brains into a single recipient?

300
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,550
Why did they own technologies like these?

301
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,575
What's in the related categories?

302
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:51,533
Fully automated brain extraction by Drones,

303
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:54,525
and a proposal for other unmanned surgical procedures...

304
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:55,563
What on earth are these?

305
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:58,551
The applicant for this latest patent...

306
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,551
Tougane Misako

307
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:00,547
Chairperson, 
The Tougane Foundation

308
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:00,547
Applicant 
Information

309
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,547
was one Tougane Misako.

310
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,535
Tougane Sakuya's mother.

311
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,577
Chairperson, 
The Tougane Foundation

312
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,577
Applicant 
Information

313
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,577
Birth Date:       February 19, 2034 (died in 2099)

314
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:09,577
Address:          268 Ichiban-cho, Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo

315
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:09,577
She died five years ago.

316
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:11,552
What about his father?

317
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,523
This information is classified

318
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:16,515
Classified?

319
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:19,561
Could this mean he was born through patented technologies?

320
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:23,512
Proof of the congenital nature of the 'AA' idiosyncrasy related to Psycho-Pass

321
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:23,516
One record found

322
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:23,524
“Proof of the congenital nature of the ‘AA' idiosyncrasy..."

323
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,512
This information is classified

324
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:25,578
No...

325
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,596
My Psycho-Pass is gonna get clouded.

326
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,546
What should I do?

327
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:35,500
Oh, yeah.

328
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:36,584
That's right!

329
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,597
It fell through.

330
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:42,526
Yeah.

331
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:46,522
I was going to check the impostors one by one, but...

332
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:50,502
We were always one step behind.

333
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,585
An alarm?

334
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:54,561
What's going on?

335
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:58,598
Something triggered the weight sensor I had installed in my apartment floor.

336
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:04,511
So you were using yourself as a decoy.

337
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,529
You're unbelievable.

338
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,541
Sorry. I'll listen to your complaints later.

339
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:15,546
I-I came to check the fire prevention and water supply systems.

340
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,528
You were occupied with work,

341
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:21,542
and you had signed a permit to let us 
access the property in your absence...

342
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,576
I'm surprised you left that thing up.

343
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:31,573
Well, there didn't seem to be any harm in doing so.

344
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:37,519
You thought the best way to get into Kamui's 
frame of mind was to preserve the view he saw.

345
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,565
Right on the money, was I?

346
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:41,594
I'd expect no less from you.

347
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,524
I'm impressed.

348
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:46,532
You're a born detective.

349
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:49,508
Thank you very much.

350
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:51,535
By that, I mean you lack charm.

351
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,513
A notification from the Bureau?

352
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:00,509
Grandma?

353
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,538
The alarm at your home has been triggered.

354
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,555
Therefore, the security level for 
Tsunemori Aoi in protective custody

355
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:10,501
has been raised to B.

356
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,547
Oh, this is... Uh...

357
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,535
Your grandmother, huh?

358
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,541
It all started with a plane crash fifteen years ago.

359
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:28,521
It was a tragic accident that claimed the lives of 
201 passengers and crew, including 184 children.

360
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:30,599
One party profited greatly from this accident:

361
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,562
the Tougane Foundation.

362
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,567
And the sole survivor of the accident...

363
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:36,500
the sole survivor of the accident was Kamui Kirito.

364
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,533
was Kamui Kirito.

365
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:37,500
the sole survivor of the accident was Kamui Kirito.

366
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:38,500
the sole survivor of the accident was Kamui Kirito.

367
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:41,584
Tougane Misako, the one who was running the foundation at the time,

368
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:45,513
was obsessed with research into an idiosyncrasy called “AA."

369
00:15:45,513 --> 00:15:47,501
As part of that research,

370
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:51,518
she conducted an experiment to demonstrate a patented technology owned by the Foundation

371
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,556
in which multiple extracted brains 
were grafted together.

372
00:15:54,591 --> 00:16:00,548
She used Kamui, along with the cadavers of the accident victims, to push her research forward,

373
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:04,578
and as a result, the Foundation's 
patented technology advanced further.

374
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,524
Kamui Kirito perpetrated his crimes to exact
 revenge against the Tougane Foundation.

375
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,553
Kamui Kirito perpetrated his crimes to exact revenge against the Tougane Foundation.

376
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:14,554
Thus, keeping an eye on the Foundation should lead us closer to arresting Kamui.

377
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,500
However, Division 1 is currently burdened with a significant liability.

378
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,538
Namely,

379
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:24,509
Tsunemori Akane and Tougane Sakuya.

380
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:30,576
Tougane Sakuya was the result of an experiment conducted by Tougane Misaki to artificially create a human with “AA."

381
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:36,581
It can be speculated that this is what led to him 
exhibiting the highest Crime Coefficient ever recorded.

382
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,548
Therefore,

383
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:42,544
Kamui, the ringleader of this crime, and Tougane 
Sakuya are connected by the key word 'AA.'

384
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:40,581
we can surmise that Kamui, the ringleader of this crime,

385
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:44,515
and Tougane Sakuya are connected by the key word “AA."

386
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:47,569
Kamui Kirito and Tougane Sakuya are equally dangerous.

387
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:52,578
Tougane Sakuya is a deviant who takes pleasure in raising the Crime Coefficients of others.

388
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:59,533
One need look no further than the five Inspectors he worked with in the past, who all became latent criminals.

389
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:01,579
It is anticipated that Tougane Sakuya's influence

390
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:06,534
will also cause Inspector Tsunemori's 
Crime Coefficient to rise in the near future.

391
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:09,530
However, Inspector Tsunemori 
does not appear concerned by this

392
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,534
and shows no intention of 
accepting the advice of others.

393
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,585
Inspector Tsunemori does not appear concerned by
The situation is critical.

394
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,585
The situation is critical.

395
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:15,576
Many Inspectors and Enforcers

396
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:20,577
have already lost their lives as a direct result of Inspector Tsunemori's poor decision-making.

397
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:21,569
As it stands,

398
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:25,507
not only will we be unable to arrest Kamui 
or suppress Tougane Sakuya,

399
00:17:24,552 --> 00:17:27,599
unable to arrest Kamui or suppress Tougane Sakuya,
the Bureau itself could be at risk.

400
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:27,599
but the Bureau itself could be at risk.

401
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:34,583
Hence, I strongly advise the dismissal of Inspector Tsunemori or the suspension of her rights as an Inspector.

402
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,545
November 27th, 2114.

403
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:41,592
November 27th, 2114 
Shimotsuki Mika, 
Criminal Investigation Department 
Division 1, Public Safety Bureau

404
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:41,592
Shimotsuki Mika, Criminal Investigation Department Division 1, Public Safety Bureau.

405
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:45,596
I'm sure Chief Kasei will understand.

406
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:54,580
No progress, huh?

407
00:17:55,589 --> 00:18:00,518
We checked all the impostors' houses and secondary places of residence,

408
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:02,552
but we found no trace of them at all.

409
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:06,586
Considering the timing, it's hard to believe they all just flew the coop.

410
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:09,519
I agree.

411
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,586
They've begun moving toward their goal.

412
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,528
We need to do whatever it takes to stop them.

413
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:18,561
You sound as if you know their objective already.

414
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:23,575
If we are to trust Masuzaki, Kamui's goal is revolution.

415
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:28,505
In order to overturn society, he will pass judgment on the existence that embodies it.

416
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:30,551
There is only one such existence.

417
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:34,537
The Sibyl System.

418
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,518
This is an interesting report.

419
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:43,569
You must have amazing investigative abilities to have reached this conclusion in so short a time.

420
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,515
Thank you very much.

421
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:47,561
Now, concerning this “AA" you mentioned.

422
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,561
That is what we call “open-door data."

423
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:53,507
Open-door data?

424
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:59,528
A honeypot designed to catch those unfit for society who intend to expose top-secret information.

425
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:01,579
And you fell for it, hook, line, and sinker.

426
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:07,521
“AA" stands for “a priori acquit."

427
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,542
It refers to those who have a criminally asymptomatic constitution by nature—

428
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,563
Sibyl's most closely guarded secret.

429
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,563
Hm? Huh?

430
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:21,510
Now, how should I deal with the girl who deviated from the 
investigation only to poke her nose where it shouldn't have been?

431
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:30,590
And yet your Psycho-Pass has barely changed.

432
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:32,548
Why?!

433
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:34,595
We can still make use of her.

434
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,595
Could you leave this one to me,

435
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:38,595
Mother?

436
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:40,591
“Mother"?

437
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:42,504
Tougane Misako

438
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:42,504
Chairperson, 
The Tougane Foundation

439
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:42,504
Applicant 
Information

440
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:45,512
It can't be.

441
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:46,512
I mean...

442
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:47,587
You may do as you please.

443
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,584
I can deal with her whenever I want.

444
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,571
After all, the real problem is...

445
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,501
If you're thinking of Tsunemori and Kamui, 
there is no need to worry.

446
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,518
I'll bring them both down.

447
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:03,556
It's my role to make you and Sibyl 
beautiful and pure, Mother.

448
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:04,552
What?

449
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:06,514
What are you talking about?

450
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:08,531
Stop it!

451
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:09,548
I don't wanna hear anything!

452
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:10,565
I don't wanna see anything!

453
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:17,549
I... I don't know anything!

454
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,532
I won't tell anyone!

455
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:22,537
I'll forget about everything!

456
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,516
A wise decision.

457
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,512
You really are an ideal citizen—

458
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,508
so ideal that you're boring.

459
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:31,559
Based on her reaction,

460
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,542
she might be a good model case for when we eventually reveal the system to the public.

461
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,555
In that case, why don't we give it a try?

462
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:39,543
Well, then...

463
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:49,555
Inspector Shimotsuki, we'll reveal to you 
the secret behind this world.

464
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:52,540
All is calm, all is bright

465
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,515
A whispering angel falls to Earth

466
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,523
No...

467
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:59,532
No!

468
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:06,587
Now it eats your body whole

469
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:11,583
It's my fault

470
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:25,539
You open your eyes

471
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:27,572
and in their grey-blue depth

472
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:30,514
I see your coldness

473
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,560
Call my name and give me a kiss

474
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,523
Embrace me

475
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:42,503
with your empty body

476
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,503
There is still life of sorts

477
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,503
There is still life of sorts

478
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,503
