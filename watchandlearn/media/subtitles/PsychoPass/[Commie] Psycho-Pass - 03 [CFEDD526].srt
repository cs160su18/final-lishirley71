00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,480
My head is full of things

3
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,640
that I can never tell anybody of

4
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,200
In this perfect world

5
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,130
I roam, a lost being

6
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,050
The impossible is holding sway over me

7
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,010
All I know of the world is what I can see

8
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,080
Is that enough to find its faults?

9
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,210
Artificial, artificial

10
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,380
Hey, how can they stay so sane?

11
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,420
This is their artificial world

12
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,220
In this beautiful world

13
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,570
there is something

14
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,040
that obscures all light for me

15
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,430
My heart tries to make sense of it

16
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,810
and finds no answer

17
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,930
Secret kills for you

18
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,650
Secret kills for you

19
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,200
Secret image for you

20
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,590
Don't show me a dark future

21
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,910
with this gaudy land

22
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,550
Show me a way to fade

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,370
The victim is Shioyama Daisuke, twenty-seven years old.

24
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,700
He worked at the Hachiouji Drone Factory.

25
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,050
His body was found at precisely 4 AM.

26
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,020
They said he was dismembered by a Drone he was testing.

27
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,190
Do you think... it was an accident?

28
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,460
I heard that this is already the third casualty in the past year at this factory.

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,980
It's clearly unusual.

30
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,320
The body was found in the Drones' behavior inspection section,

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,990
the only manned area in the otherwise automated production line.

32
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,160
There are about fifty debuggers working there around the clock.

33
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,960
Is that a live-in job?

34
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,380
There are over 1000 Drones

35
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,860
that need to be evaluated and verified each month.

36
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,170
They have no choice but to work around the clock.

37
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,340
If you can install a program that induces a malfunction in a Drone before it's tested,

38
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,270
there's a good chance you can make it look like an accident.

39
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,020
Which means...

40
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,860
This could be a murder case.

41
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,480
But if there are only fifty suspects,

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,310
can't we just check everyone's Crime Coefficient?

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,980
Well, it's not that simple.

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,080
#03: Rearing Conventions

45
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,490
Inspector Ginoza...

46
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,300
What is it?

47
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,630
I feel like I'll be able to get along well with the Enforcers.

48
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,900
Do you mean you'll get along with them as a colleague?

49
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,040
Or as their handler?

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,920
They say that fools learn from their experiences,

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
while the wise learn from history.

52
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,780
I hope you're not a fool.

53
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
Welcome, detectives.

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,910
I'd like to see where it happened.

55
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,330
Of course. This way, please.

56
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,790
We do a safety check and a test run here after the Drones are built.

57
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,650
We depend on machines for all the other processes,

58
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,740
but the final check still needs to be done by humans, as it's always been.

59
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,160
As you can see, it's dangerous work.

60
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,770
It's hard on the debuggers, isn't it?

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
Yes, it is.

62
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,010
In fact, there aren't many ways to deal with stress here, unlike in the outside world.

63
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,500
You can't connect to the net, so there's not much in the way of diversions.

64
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,950
Is this place offline?

65
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,400
We're not wired for it,

66
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,890
and this building itself is an anechoic chamber,

67
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,920
so there's no way to access outside communications networks here.

68
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,470
This is the most efficient security system against hacking.

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,740
How horrifying.

70
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,810
A totally isolated area, huh?

71
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,680
The body was already taken away by a Drone during the initial response.

72
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,480
However, I'm told it was all recorded on this disk.

73
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,100
It's like his body was dissected by the Drone while he was still alive.

74
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,210
Nasty.

75
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:04,420
Blood Type

76
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,510
Did the victim, Mr. Shioyama, have anyone with a grudge against him?

77
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:04,420
Shioyama Daisuke

78
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:04,420
Height:                            Weight:

79
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:04,420
Hue:

80
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,850
No, he didn't.

81
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,650
He was a model employee.

82
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,360
His Psycho-Pass showed no indication of any problems.

83
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
It must have been an accident.

84
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,440
But this is the third incident of this kind. Don't you think that's a few too many?

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,890
As I told you earlier, this is a dangerous work environment.

86
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,940
If you have any criticisms regarding our management, we're all ears,

87
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,820
but please air those concerns through the appropriate channels.

88
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,100
What about the Drone that went out of control?

89
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,390
I'm having it sent to headquarters.

90
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,770
We'll have to wait for Karanomori to complete her analysis,

91
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,570
but I was told that its memory, including the backup, is gone.

92
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,290
We probably shouldn't expect much.

93
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,310
For now, head back to the car and forward this to headquarters.

94
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,070
I have a few more things to talk about with Chief Goda.

95
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay.

96
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,940
These are the Psycho-Passes for all staff within this facility.

97
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,340
These records contain the results of our detailed periodic checks

98
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,840
along with the Hue Assessments by the scanners installed in the building.

99
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,030
Thank you.

100
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,190
As you can see for yourself,

101
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,290
there are no staff members who continuously exceeded the regulation value.

102
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,410
Even if you suspect murder, there's no suspect to be found.

103
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,130
We won't know that until we analyze this data using the Sibyl System.

104
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,540
That will take some time.

105
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,800
But there's an easier way to check.

106
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,810
Oh? Like what?

107
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,770
We can use our Dominators.

108
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,650
Please have all the staff come outside the anechoic chamber

109
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,610
and let us check them using our devices.

110
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,940
But that'll disrupt our operations.

111
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,570
People's lives are at stake here.

112
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,750
If you can provide evidence that Shioyama's death was a murder,

113
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,130
we will certainly cooperate with you.

114
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,120
But as things stand, we have no choice but to consider this an accident.

115
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,900
If you want to investigate our staff even to the point of disrupting production,

116
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,890
please file a request with the Ministry of Economy first.

117
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,690
I bet Nobuchika's trying to put some pressure on that chief right now.

118
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,350
What a pain.

119
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,200
What do you mean?

120
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,090
You saw the documents too, right?

121
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,590
This is a government facility under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy.

122
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,650
And government offices always look out for their own bottom lines.

123
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:48,980
So they don't want anyone interfering enough to cause a drop in productivity.

124
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,550
Even though someone lost their life?

125
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,660
That's exactly why they want it to be declared an accident as soon as possible.

126
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,670
But their scanner hasn't actually detected anyone dangerous, right?

127
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,690
Well, who knows?

128
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:12,070
The best these scanners can do is measure a person's stress patterns by performing a Hue Assessment.

129
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,210
If you want to actually compute a person's mental state based on the cymatic scan data

130
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,880
in order to check their job aptitude and Crime Coefficient,

131
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,080
you need to wait in line for an analysis by the Sibyl System.

132
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:32,440
However, our Dominators are able to cut in line,
so to speak, and request an analysis immediately.

133
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
That's why they can see right through someone's mind

134
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,580
with no time lag as soon as you point the gun at them.

135
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,640
But...

136
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,890
Hold it in your hand.

137
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,590
User authentication: Inspector Tsunemori Akane.

138
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,760
Dominator usage approval confirmed.

139
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,570
Communication error.

140
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,450
System link cannot be established.

141
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,170
Since this facility blocks all electromagnetic radiation,

142
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,000
we won't be able to connect to the Sibyl System while inside.

143
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,530
And without that, your Dominator's basically just scrap iron.

144
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,710
Nothing but a glorified paperweight.

145
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,930
I wonder what the chances are.

146
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,230
You mean the chance that his death was an accident?

147
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,440
Ha! It was hard not to laugh.

148
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,470
No kidding.

149
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,600
If your intuition didn't tell you that the moment you saw him, you're no detective.

150
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,590
I'm sure all the Enforcers had a gut feeling.

151
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
That was a murder. No doubt about it.

152
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,820
I wonder what the motive was.

153
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,140
Based on the victim's condition, I'm guessing...

154
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,870
it was a grudge.

155
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,330
Man, this place must really suck to work at.

156
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,070
I can't imagine being stuck in an offline environment in this day and age.

157
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,840
But the Psycho-Pass Hues for the workers here are rather stable.

158
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,570
No matter where you are, people find ways to entertain themselv—

159
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,930
How's it going?

160
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,600
Did you find anything suspicious?

161
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,690
No. The data you gave us showed nothing unusual—

162
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,730
Hey, yellow-green.

163
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,930
Gonna have lunch in your fancy private room again today?

164
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,370
What are they doing? That's terrible!

165
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,700
Oh, that. You can just leave them be.

166
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,410
Huh?

167
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,710
These things happen often.

168
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,300
Since this is an environment with few diversions,

169
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,660
we need someone to keep the others entertained, you know?

170
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,100
But isn't he...

171
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,580
If his Psycho-Pass gets cloudy enough to be an issue,

172
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,670
we'll assign him somewhere else right away.

173
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,510
As I told you,

174
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,450
we take great care in managing the
psychological state of our employees.

175
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,770
This man has his own role to play, same as anyone else.

176
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,680
Sibyl might've recommended this workplace to him

177
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,840
because he was best suited for this purpose.

178
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,530
And I guess someone like you,
who can laugh and turn a blind eye,

179
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,610
is best suited to run this place.

180
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,410
What a blessing the Sibyl System is, huh?

181
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,920
Are you okay?

182
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,840
Th-Thank you.

183
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,850
If what that chief guy said is true,

184
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,820
there's always one person whose Hue Check gets worse over time.

185
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,390
And this person is later transferred somewhere else without exception.

186
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,450
However, no one has been reassigned for the past year.

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,330
The deaths start happening a year ago, right?

188
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:56,040
And for that past year, the same person has been the target of bullying.

189
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,420
The data clearly indicates it.

190
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,280
Other people's Psycho-Passes show clear colors,

191
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,220
but there's one person whose Psycho-Pass is clouded.

192
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,840
Ah! Kanehara Yuji. This Hue Assessment shows yellow-green.

193
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,600
Age

194
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,600
Division:         2nd System Investigation Dept.

195
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,600
Sex

196
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,600
Birthdate

197
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,600
Height                                       Weight

198
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,600
Blood Type

199
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,570
I see. That explains his nickname.

200
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,010
Seems like the Hue Assessment results are open to everyone here.

201
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,620
This is crazy.

202
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,320
But this guy's latest measurement shows an improved Hue.

203
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,980
In fact, his Hue was the cloudiest...

204
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,040
on the day before Shioyama died.

205
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,590
Can't be... That doesn't make sense.

206
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,200
Why would a person's Psycho-Pass improve after killing someone?

207
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,880
The other employees

208
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,990
have all been taking out their stress on Kanehara himself.

209
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,890
It's not that strange when you think about it.

210
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,200
Back in the days when we didn't have cymatic scans,

211
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,300
these sorts of incidents weren't that uncommon.

212
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,690
Get real!

213
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,300
Is this more of that "detective's intuition" you're always talking about?

214
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,440
You're just deluding yourself!

215
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,190
It proves that latent criminals like you are the dregs of society!

216
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,710
We can't act on some speculation based on circumstantial evidence.

217
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,830
Our job...

218
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,000
is to maintain an orderly society based on the Crime Coefficients judged by Sibyl.

219
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,470
The kind of order where three people die in one year?

220
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,500
Gino, leave it to me.

221
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,540
I'll find out whether Kanehara is the killer.

222
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,010
I'll have conclusive evidence before you kn—

223
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,020
Enough already!

224
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,430
Inspector Ginoza, may I speak to you?

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,530
I agree with them.

226
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,390
I'd rather try Kougami's plan than risk letting a crime go unsolved.

227
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,950
Are you serious?

228
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,380
You're the one who's acting strange here!

229
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,290
Did something happen between you and Masaoka?

230
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,280
I... I can do a better job working with the Enforcers!

231
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,310
I see. So you've decided to be a fool after all.

232
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,400
You may be new, but you're still an Inspector.

233
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,620
If you think you can keep those hunting dogs under control, you're welcome to try.

234
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,950
Inspector Ginoza...

235
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,410
Since you insist on being a fool, you should try learning through experience like one.

236
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,650
That's the fastest route to understanding things.

237
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,310
Did something happen between Ginoza and Masaoka?

238
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,120
Wait, Akane, don't tell me you seriously asked Gino that to his face?!

239
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,200
You really shouldn't have brought that up.

240
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,840
What?

241
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,990
So we have a total of 200 meters' worth of communication cables, huh?

242
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,640
The furthest they'll reach is the elevator hall on the second floor.

243
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,230
Can you bring Kanehara out there?

244
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,240
I'll do my best.

245
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,730
Um...

246
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,230
You're just gonna talk to him, right?

247
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,180
Yeah.

248
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,650
So this is where you were, you yellow-green bastard!

249
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,070
Does your food taste better with blood on your hands?

250
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,690
Well? Does it?!

251
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,540
Shioyama, Asami, and Koriyama...

252
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,710
You killed them all, didn't you?!

253
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,980
Wh-Why are you saying that?

254
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,980
As long as you confine yourself in here, we can't prove your guilt.

255
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,260
But I hate your stinkin' guts all the same!

256
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,840
There's nothing we Enforcers like more than putting other latent criminals in their place.

257
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,770
So we're gonna keep you holed up in this factory like the rat you are.

258
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,240
We'll spread word all over the net

259
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,130
that Kanehara Yuji is a killer whose Psycho-Pass is clouded.

260
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,830
D-Don't!

261
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,380
Oops. This place is out of service range. Oh well.

262
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,090
I'm just gonna head over to the entrance for a bit.

263
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,160
You can just sit there, trembling on your hands and knees,

264
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,380
and wait as we tear your miserable life to pieces all around you!

265
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,240
Wh-What're you doing?!

266
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,950
Kougami!

267
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,120
Now we'll know for sure if Kanehara is someone who's capable of murder.

268
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,660
He doesn't have time to prepare anything in advance.

269
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,880
If he wants to kill me right away, he'll do it the same way he did before.

270
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
When he does, we can prove his crime.

271
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,340
Th-That's crazy!

If he's innocent, we'll be able to get out safely.

279
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,210
And we'll all live happily ever after.

280
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,520
Inspector... which would you bet on?

281
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,360
I can't...

282
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,490
You brought this on yourselves.

283
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,450
There's our answer, Inspector.

284
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,710
Once you're gone, my Hue can be cleansed!

285
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,580
Run!

286
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,700
I won't let you get away.

287
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,770
I'll never let you get away.

288
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,180
I'll kill you, right here and now!

289
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,980
Dammit!

290
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,500
Why... Why would you do something so reckless?!

291
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,880
This is about finding the truth behind a matter of life and death!

292
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,450
Of course we'd need to put our lives in the line!

293
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,730
Go faster! We're not gonna make it!

294
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,190
You don't have to tell me that!

295
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,460
This is the place.

296
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,440
We've already caught the criminal red-handed! We need to call for backup and...

297
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,380

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,030
Target will be completely eliminated.

307
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,680
Please exercise caution.

308
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,150
Hey, Ko!

309
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,520
As always, the Dominators kick ass when they get serious.

310
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,710
He said that he wanted to be a detective, not just a hunting dog.

311
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,850
But the look in his eyes...

312
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,810
was unmistakably...

313
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,650
that of a carnivore which had cornered its prey.

314
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:46,500
It seems all fairy tales are dead

315
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,480
It seems all fairy tales are dead

316
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,830
In a hospital ward of brick stones

317
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,920
my voice is too coarse to sing

318
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,040
Outside in the foggy haze

319
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,640
a red moon glows

320
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,040
Look at me

321
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,560
Do not avert your gaze

322
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,880
Behind black bars

323
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,560
I was born

324
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,000
I wish there were a punishment for evil

325
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,870
Always I need you

326
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,540
Now, grant us justice

327
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,060
before chaos takes us all

328
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,330
Pay the price of fate and let us go together,

329
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:50,080
nameless beasts

330
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,810
This is a world where the mental state and personal tendencies of humans can be quantified.
While all sorts of inclinations are recorded and policed, these measured numbers used to judge people's souls are commonly called "Psycho-Pass".
