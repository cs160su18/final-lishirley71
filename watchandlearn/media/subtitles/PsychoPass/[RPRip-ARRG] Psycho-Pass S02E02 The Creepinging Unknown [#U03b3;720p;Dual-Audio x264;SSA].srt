1
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:13,570
The body found at the crime scene belonged to Enforcer Yamatoya from Division 2.

2
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,542
The enforcement was carried out with a Dominator,

3
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:19,583
and the shooter was Division 2's own Inspector Shisui.

4
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:25,559
After carrying out the enforcement, she absconded with Yamatoya's Dominator and hasn't been seen since.

5
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,559
So an Inspector went missing...

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,506
Frankly, I don't know what to make of this.

7
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:33,550
We don't have much else to go on for now.

8
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:46,599
WC?

9
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:47,503

10
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:08,071
I will go insane

11
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,505
if the world keeps ruining my life

12
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:10,555
I've stopped breathing

13
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:13,514
from the nervousness every day

14
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:15,505
Enigmatic feeling

15
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:23,598
I have to be the aggressor

16
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:26,565
The world has stopped making sense

17
00:01:26,507 --> 00:01:28,553
It's dissolving

18
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:30,565
God has come to us

19
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:33,507
with sword in hand

20
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,591
The world has split in two

21
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:39,570
Half is mad,

22
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,571
and so am I

23
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,537
Where's the difference?

24
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,596
Where's the difference?

25
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:48,521
Only God can walk the borderline

26
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,588
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

27
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:55,543
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

28
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:58,564
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

29
00:01:58,564 --> 00:02:01,581
I have no focus in my soul

30
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:05,548
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

31
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:08,552
I can't even look into the mirror

32
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,508
the creeping unknown

33
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,508
the creeping unknown

34
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,503
the creeping unknown

35
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,503
the creeping unknown

36
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,504
the creeping unknown

37
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,504
the creeping unknown

38
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,504
the creeping unknown

39
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,504
the creeping unknown

40
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,508
Akira Yamatoya

41
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,508
Akira Yamatoya

42
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:28,542
I've written up a report detailing our approach to capturing the bomber the other day,

43
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,544
including my observations as to what I believe we mishandled.

44
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,595
Please submit it to the Chief.

45
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:39,597
The emphasis of this report is not appropriate.

46
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:45,519
Your focus on an Inspector who
deviated from her duty is misplaced.

47
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,526
I had some choice words for you as well, Ginoza.

48
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:55,557
To think that you, an Enforcer, would point a
Dominator at a fellow Enforcer from Division 2.

49
00:02:56,548 --> 00:03:01,535
Going by the book doesn't always yield the best results.

50
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:02,587
You should keep that in mind.

51
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:05,525
I don't need to take any advice from an Enforcer.

52
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:13,575
You may want to ease up a little, Inspector Shimotsuki.

53
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,563
Ginoza was an Inspector too.

54
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:20,514
His opinions are based on experience and can certainly come in handy.

55
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,541
Yayoi...

56
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:29,511
The fact that he's no longer an Inspector 
only makes taking his advice less judicious.

57
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:36,599
Yeah, I think it's a good report.

58
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:38,595
Are you sure about this?

59
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,542
I gave you permission to utilize it,

60
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,595
so you won't be sanctioned, Ginoza.

61
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:47,595
I'll go question Kitazawa.

62
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,544
Who's conducting the Holo analysis of the crime scene?

63
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:51,592
I am.

64
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:55,524
All right. I want Hinakawa to take over.

65
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:57,551
You want Hinakawa to do it?

66
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,572
You can handle it, right, Hinakawa?

67
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,519
Yes...

68
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:10,519
Inspector Shimotsuki, I want you and the others to decode the message left at the crime scene.

69
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:12,565
I'll leave matters here to you, okay?

70
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:23,541
Inspector Tsunemori.

71
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,566
Kitazawa Akira.

72
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:38,576
Your Crime Coefficient suffered an acute spike
immediately following the fourth of a series of bombings.

73
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:41,584
Normally, that wouldn't be possible.

74
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:47,508
How did you keep your Psycho-Pass clear up to that point?

75
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:48,532
Answer the question.

76
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,527
What's so funny?

77
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:54,557
My Hue is clear.

78
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:56,517
It can't get clouded.

79
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:58,524
I've always been clear.

80
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:03,575
It's all thanks to him. He always helps me out.

81
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:06,516
He's the best.

82
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,550
“He”?

83
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:12,583
Why did you go so far as to use a Holo to fabricate a hostage situation just to lure out the Bureau?

84
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:14,557
Huh?

85
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:17,511
Holo? What're you talking about?

86
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:20,542
I'm talking about the hologram you used to make us think you took a hostage.

87
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,538
No!

88
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,509
That was him!

89
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,562
He made me clear!

90
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:28,577
I'll take on the world with him!

91
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:33,586
We're getting nowhere.

92
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,555
We questioned him too, but it was just more of the same.

93
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,559
He kept raving on and on about that imaginary accomplice of his.

94
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,571
He must be mentally ill.

95
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:44,570
Raving...

96
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,515
Since the cymatic scan didn't detect anything,

97
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,587
no one else could've been there.

98
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:54,583
Any news on Inspector Shisui?

99
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:58,562
It's strange.

100
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:03,540
Although it comes and goes, we've been able to track her whereabouts via GPS.

101
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,501
Her Dominator is still online and remains properly authenticated.

102
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:14,520
In other words, Inspector Shisui's actions are approved by Sibyl.

103
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,540
Chief Kasei thinks so too.

104
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:25,541
Shisui is conducting an investigation that Sibyl acknowledges. She isn't breaking any laws.

105
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:33,551
If we are to trust the Dominator's response, 
that's the only possibility.

106
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:36,575
You're saying that Yamatoya's
enforcement was also appropriate?

107
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:40,534
He might've tried to run.

108
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,582
That's more than enough reason for enforcement.

109
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:47,555
Then why did Inspector Shisui disappear?

110
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:51,514
Circumstances might have forced her to operate in secret.

111
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:56,510
That could explain why she left a message.

112
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,528
WC...

113
00:06:58,528 --> 00:06:59,584
Right.

114
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:04,515
Do you really think that's the case, Inspector Aoyanagi?

115
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:07,553
Well, do you have any other ideas?

116
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,537
What if...

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,553
What if there was someone else there? Someone outside the Bureau?

118
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:21,588
What if this third party shot Yamatoya and wrote that message?

119
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:24,567
Don't tell me you actually believe what Kitazawa said?

120
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,568
I'm saying it's possible.

121
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:34,557
There's no such thing as a person who can't be seen by the Sibyl System.

122
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,573
Searching for ghosts...

123
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:40,552
isn't in my job description.

124
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,540
The first thing that comes to mind is “water closet”, isn't it?

125
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,595
Huh? Most people would think “World Cup”.

126
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:56,587
It could be “wild-caught”, too.

127
00:07:56,587 --> 00:08:00,564
Captive-bred wild animals, huh?

128
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,504
But that wouldn't make sense.

129
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:03,596
Says the guy whose first instinct was “restroom”.

130
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:06,551
What's the point of writing “restroom” on a wall?

131
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:09,501
If you gotta go, no one's stopping you!

132
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,535
Hey, I didn't write it.

133
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:43,577
You need to do more than watch if you want to ease your stress...

134
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:45,566
Inspector.

135
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:54,564
Thank you for giving me permission to
tag along when you questioned Kitazawa.

136
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:58,560
Keeping me out would've been playing by the book.

137
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:01,502
Are you referring to the Tougane Foundation?

138
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:04,555
Yes. As I'm sure you're aware,

139
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:07,540
one of Kitazawa's targets, OW Pharmaceuticals,

140
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,540
is run by the Touganes—

141
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,541
my relatives.

142
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:17,515
You don't seem the type that allows emotions to cloud your decisions,

143
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:22,550
so I decided that the benefits of taking you with me outweighed the risks.

144
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:26,571
You were a therapist, weren't you, Tougane?

145
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:31,530
So you came to that conclusion by considering my background.

146
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,523
Your ability to read people is impressive.

147
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,563
This is... amazing!

148
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:43,535
You left the Holo verification to Hinakawa

149
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:47,561
in order to capitalize on his background as a Holo designer.

150
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:52,557
That's only natural.

151
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,553
A boss should know her subordinates.

152
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,519
What is it?

153
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,538
The ghost exists.

154
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,568
I think you're right.

155
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,576
There's no proof.

156
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:28,537
I also know that it's not that easy to deceive cymatic scans and Drones.

157
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,520
Even so, Kitazawa doesn't appear to be delusional.

158
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,524
It's hard to think that someone like him would commit a crime on his own in the first place.

159
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,579
I agree. There must be someone behind him, pulling the strings.

160
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:43,508
Otherwise, it doesn't make much sense.

161
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:47,500
I-Inspector...

162
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,596
What's the matter, Hinakawa?

163
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,534
That Holo is amazing!

164
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:56,555
Yeah, the design is incredibly elaborate.

165
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:59,586
It uses a massive amount of data to define its appearance.

166
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:04,514
If you're just trying to deceive the eye, 
there's no reason to use this many layers.

167
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:07,588
Is it actually possible to create such a sophisticated Holo?

168
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:09,536
If you have a model, yes.

169
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,517
Karanomori.

170
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:12,532
On it.

171
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:17,523
I can't find her in the Ministry of Welfare's database.

172
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:21,540
Right. It's hard to use an existing person.

173
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,550
They could bump into each other.

174
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:26,587
But if it's someone who's not with us anymore...

175
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,504
So she's a victim?

176
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:32,500
Okay. Let me try searching a different database.

177
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:36,560
There's one person with matching characteristics.

178
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,517
It's a girl who died in a plane crash fifteen years ago.

179
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,510
Not too shabby, Shou.

180
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:44,542
Hold on.

181
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:47,531
The deceased was eight years old at the time.

182
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:50,517
Yeah, that Holo doesn't really
look like an eight-year-old, huh?

183
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:55,502
Basically, this Holo was designed by 
extrapolating the physical features of the deceased

184
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:59,537
into an approximated model of her
present-day appearance, now fifteen years later.

185
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:04,520
It just doesn't add up. This is way too elaborate, 
no matter how you look at it.

186
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,520
Maybe they're the type that wants to go the extra mile?

187
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,548
It happens more often than you might think.

188
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:15,551
Inspector Tsunemori, where are you right now?

189
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:18,591
I'm in the Analysis Lab. Did something happen?

190
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:20,576
Kitazawa's Crime Coefficient...

191
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,581
has dropped so low that he's 
no longer a target for enforcement.

192
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:35,535
How could this...

193
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:40,501
Yeah. To see a Crime Coefficient 
that had risen to a level for enforcement

194
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:41,574
actually go down this low...

195
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:44,590
It must be unprecedented.

196
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,521
It's thanks to him.

197
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:53,554
He came to see me. He made me clear.

198
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:55,533
Let's check the visitors' record.

199
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:59,501
Way ahead of you. What he's saying is a lie.

200
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,557
According to the security footage,

201
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:06,535
his only visitor was a therapist 
from the Bureau's medical agency.

202
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,581
There was no one else.

203
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:14,523
I'd like to speak to that therapist.

204
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,515
It's been a while.

205
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:21,541
Under normal circumstances,
I couldn't bring myself to face you.

206
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:25,520
Don't blame yourself. It wasn't your fault.

207
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,587
Was there anything unusual about
your therapy session with Kitazawa?

208
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:35,546
I simply provided my usual services.

209
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:38,559
The security cameras will confirm that, I'm sure.

210
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,593
They do, yes.

211
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:47,510
You look very tired. Maybe you're overworked.

212
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:50,542
You lack both sleep and relaxation.

213
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,585
You need some time to refresh yourself.

214
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:57,594
Maybe, but that's easier said than done.

215
00:13:58,534 --> 00:14:02,506
Also, this advice is outside my field,

216
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:04,592
but smoking is harmful to your health.

217
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:07,548
Keep it in moderation.

218
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,522
This is unprecedented.

219
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,535
I never thought I'd see someone who committed such serious crimes relocated to a general medical facility.

220
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:30,581
We have no choice now that his Psycho-Pass has cleared up.

221
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:32,539
Those are the rules.

222
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:39,523
Inspector, why did you outsource his transfer to
Division 2 when we were the ones who brought him in?

223
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:42,553
Sorry. I wanted to go home early today.

224
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:43,565
Huh?!

225
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:48,582
A therapist told me that my Psycho-Pass 
might get clouded, so I got a little spooked.

226
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:51,566
I'll finish the report by tomorrow.

227
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:54,521
I'll see you then.

228
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:55,582
Wait!

229
00:14:55,582 --> 00:15:00,584
Once Kitazawa is in that facility,
he'll be out of our jurisdiction.

230
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:03,592
This transfer is the last opportunity to question him.

231
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:06,543
Right, and that's exactly why...

232
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:09,597
Tsunemori is probably considering Aoyanagi's feelings.

233
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:11,599
Try to understand.

234
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:24,559
I wonder if this is enough to get the smell to stick to me.

235
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:30,508
Secondhand smoke is harmful to your health!

236
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,554
Give it a rest. I know that.

237
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:38,575
Why don't we clean the room for a change? It'll cheer you up!

238
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:40,506
Sure, whatever.

239
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,524
Oh? There's a scratch on the wall.

240
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,547
Would you like me to contact a repairman?

241
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:48,593
A scratch?

242
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,577
There's no way...

243
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:04,532
Inspector! Kitazawa escaped!

244
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:11,548
It happened in the Tama ward's KT Building.

245
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:15,528
When Division 2 asked him where he made the bombs,

246
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:19,504
he showed them to a rental office in the building.

247
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:26,564
He then wounded Inspector Aoyanagi 
with a knife he'd hidden in the room beforehand

248
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:29,504
and escaped with the bombs he had prepared.

249
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:30,590
He is currently at large.

250
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,510
Inspector Aoyanagi...

251
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:38,552
How could someone with a clear Psycho-Pass be capable of this?

252
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:47,511
We've imposed a traffic restriction in the area 
and advised residents to evacuate.

253
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,595
Considering how little time has passed since the incident, Kitazawa is likely still close by.

254
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,554
There's a narrow alley behind the building that leads to an entrance to the sewers.

255
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:02,537
True, but it's locked.

256
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,500
He can't utilize it.

257
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:07,513
What if it was unlocked beforehand?

258
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:08,597
That's not possible.

259
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:11,593
There's a scanner at the entrance.

260
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:15,589
Anyone who might've gotten close to it would've been detected.

261
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:26,502
I see Kitazawa at the sewer entrance. Looks like it was unlocked.

262
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:28,500
Impossible! How?!

263
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,540
At any rate, we should follow him.

264
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,528
We're too far from his location.

265
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,515
We'll take care of it.

266
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:36,533
Is that you, Tsunemori?

267
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:39,554
You predicted Kitazawa's escape route?

268
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:45,506
It seemed unlikely to me that he could formulate an escape plan during his transfer all on his own.

269
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:48,576
Moreover, being in custody, 
he couldn't have prepared a weapon himself.

270
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:56,539
There's no doubt that someone out there
acted as an accessory to Kitazawa's escape.

271
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:00,598
Someone who has the means to evade cymatic scans.

272
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:07,548
And whoever they are, they're challenging the Public Safety Bureau.

273
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:16,568
I... I...

274
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,547
Don't move.

275
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,537
Stay away from me! I planted another bomb.

276
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:50,503
If you come any closer, I'll set it off!

277
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:55,557
Just give up.

278
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,535
You think I'm lying, don't you?

279
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:01,504
Damn you... Always mocking me...

280
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:02,525
Don't do it!

281
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,518
Did he...

282
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,560
I've still got one more bomb.

283
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:27,506
He went to a lot of trouble to help me escape.

284
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,562
So I have to go.

285
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:33,553
Even you said I wasn't wrong, didn't you?!

286
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:36,500
That may have been the case...

287
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,580
before you pressed that button.

288
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,520
Crime Coefficient is 357.

289
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,570
Lethal Eliminator.

290
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,561
Inspector, please grant me permission to fire.

291
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,530
Forgive me, Kamui. After all the trouble you went through to make me clear...

292
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:56,513
Kamui?

293
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:58,569
Who is Kamui?

294
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,565
Please, tell me.

295
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:05,573
What color am I now?

296
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,552
What color?

297
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:13,523
All I see in you is the color of raw sewage.

298
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,550
That's it. I get it now.

299
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:36,503
The meaning behind that message...

300
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,563
How foolish the Public Safety Bureau is.

301
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,530
He could've been made clear again.

302
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,530
He still could've been saved.

303
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:53,568
Tsunemori Akane...

304
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:56,581
I had hoped that you would understand.

305
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:58,581

306
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:20,002
