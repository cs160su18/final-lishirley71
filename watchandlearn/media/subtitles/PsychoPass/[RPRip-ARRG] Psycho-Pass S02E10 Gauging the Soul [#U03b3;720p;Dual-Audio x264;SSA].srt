1
00:00:03,582 --> 00:00:06,595
A train is arriving. Please stand clear.

2
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:12,503
Train A1971 suddenly started accelerating.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,574
It's out of control.

4
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:15,508
A runaway train?

5
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,511
At this rate, we've only got a few minutes before it crashes into the train ahead of it.

6
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,559
Evacuate all trains in service immediately.

7
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:24,563
I want all those passengers out of there now!

8
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:36,553
All trains have been brought to the emergency station.

9
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,523
Okay. Switch the tracks back.

10
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:42,569
It's rejecting the signal!

11
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:48,535
A1971 is headed to the emergency station!

12
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:54,553
Let's get started.

13
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:09,513
We will be stopping momentarily for a quick car inspection.

14
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:10,580
We apologize for the inconvenience.

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,519
Please stand by and remain on the train.

16
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:25,520
Decomposer.

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,557
Target will be completely eliminated.

18
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:38,516
The wastewater facility in the subway's emergency station has been destroyed.

19
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,510
They used one runaway train to gather the rest of them together

20
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,508
and isolated them using wastewater 
from the neighboring area.

21
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,559
Fortunately, the shelter is keeping them from being submerged, but...

22
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,555
...because they can't drain the water, the passengers are trapped.

23
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,551
Kamui and his group have 
trapped themselves as well.

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,572
Why would they do that?

25
00:01:57,593 --> 00:02:00,589
We've taken too much backbone out of the MLIT.

26
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,585
To think that they still haven't been able to drain the wastewater...

27
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:07,532
I see.

28
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:14,528
So we kept proof of the scandal in case they try to take our place again, did we?

29
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:19,545
As a result, it looks like more than 500 
passengers have become Kamui's hostages.

30
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,545
His goal? This?

31
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:28,579
Surely not. If he merely wanted to reproduce the Season of Hell, we would've been able to take care of him by now.

32
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:40,518
Division 3 can't handle them all on their own.

33
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,583
Where do you think you're going?

34
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:59,553
This is an emergency.

35
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:02,575
We need to analyze the situation 
and come up with a plan right away.

36
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:06,510
From the moment a member 
of your family became a hostage,

37
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,592
you were rendered unfit to participate in this investigation.

38
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,530
That's my decision to make.

39
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,509
I'm the Inspector here.

40
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,580
But this is Chief Kasei's decision.

41
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:19,526
Step aside, please.

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,553
It's not my fault. It's not my fault. 
It's not my fault. It's not...

43
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:35,515
That's right.

44
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,549
Feel the pain of knowing you're responsible for the death of someone precious to you.

45
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:42,595
Paint yourself black, Tsunemori Akane.

46
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:59,567
I will go insane

47
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,501
if the world keeps ruining my life

48
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,551
I've stopped breathing

49
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:09,510
from the nervousness every day

50
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,502
Enigmatic feeling

51
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:19,594
I have to be the aggressor

52
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:22,561
The world has stopped making sense

53
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:24,549
It's dissolving

54
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:26,562
God has come to us

55
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:29,504
with sword in hand

56
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,587
The world has split in two

57
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:35,567
Half is mad,

58
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,567
and so am I

59
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,534
Where's the difference?

60
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:40,592
Where's the difference?

61
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:44,518
Only God can walk the borderline

62
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:47,585
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

63
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:51,539
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

64
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:54,552
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

65
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:57,581
I have no focus in my soul

66
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:01,544
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

67
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:04,549
I can't even look into the mirror

68
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:16,576
Crime Coefficient is 148.

69
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,555
A target for enforcement action.

70
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:22,501
gauging the soul

71
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:22,501
gauging the soul

72
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:23,501
gauging the soul

73
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:23,501
gauging the soul

74
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:24,501
gauging the soul

75
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:24,501
gauging the soul

76
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,578
Start with those who are likely to go over 300.

77
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:35,552
Knock them out with Paralyzers.

78
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,586
They're randomly shooting passengers?!

79
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:44,582
How terrible!

80
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:50,500
I'm counting on you since the Chief has ordered Akane on standby.

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,517
Right. I'm the only one they've got.

82
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:55,546
I'm in charge of Division 1 now.

83
00:05:55,571 --> 00:06:00,505
It's okay. I simply acted according to Sibyl's will.

84
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:01,592
There's no way my Psycho-Pass will get clouded.

85
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:05,534
D-Dominators don't work on Kamui.

86
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:07,547
H-How are we going to...

87
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:10,589
Still, we can't just sit back and let this happen, can we?

88
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,535
If only we knew more about his goal.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,557
Kamui is seeking revenge against the Tougane Foundation.

90
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:22,503
This incident must relate to that somehow as well.

91
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,549
It's true that both Kitazawa's crime and the barricade incident are connected to the Tougane Foundation.

92
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:30,558
But what grounds are you saying it's revenge?

93
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,595
Take a look.

94
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,592
It was the Tougane Foundation 
that pushed for Kamui's surgery.

95
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:39,563
They used him in a clinical trial 
for the benefit of the Foundation.

96
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:42,577
Surgery... A multi-body brain transplant...

97
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:49,506
With that in mind, I suspected that Kamui harbored a grudge against the Tougane Foundation.

98
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,502
It's going all over the place.

99
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,544
With this much data flying around...

100
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,569
I suspected that might be what they were up to.

101
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:05,503
A ruling will always be handed down for each crime using information captured by the Dominators.

102
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,579
If enough are being used at the same time, 
the amount of data becomes massive,

103
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,567
which should overload the normal processing routes.

104
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:19,513
When that happens, a bypass route 
appears on the network for them to use.

105
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:23,588
Security isn't as tight on our backup data channels.

106
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:27,509
So they wanted to trigger the bypass.

107
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:30,505
We've located the bypass. 
This may actually work!

108
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,514
Stay on top of it.

109
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:36,556
You gathered Dominators in order to locate the Sibyl System.

110
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,547
Isn't that right, Kirito?

111
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:44,599
I thought I ordered you to stand by.

112
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,561
I don't think we can afford to 
sit on our hands in this situation.

113
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:52,516
Fair enough. I'll assign you a different task, then.

114
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:54,520
Assassinating Kamui Kirito.

115
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,591
Correct.

116
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:57,542
I knew it.

117
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,512
What?

118
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:03,582
Given the nature of his crimes and 
his connection to the Season of Hell,

119
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:07,588
it's obvious that the Tougane Foundation isn't his target.

120
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:10,522
He wants to know...

121
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,539
what color Sibyl is.

122
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,586
You want eliminate Kamui right away

123
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:17,585
because he's about to come in contact with Sibyl.

124
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:21,577
You've always enjoyed sticking your nose where it doesn't belong, haven't you?

125
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:29,507
As it stands, he'll probably find his way 
to us within an hour, as you've guessed.

126
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:32,553
Of course, I don't intend to let that happen.

127
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:40,517
I ordered the first responders from Division 3 to place 
bombs above the area where the culprits are holed up.

128
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:42,538
What are you thinking?!

129
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,517
There are more than 500 hostages down there!

130
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:53,555
Humans are very unlikely to keep their Psycho-Passes clear while being hunted in such an ill-fated environment.

131
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:56,514
Most of them are probably latent criminals by now.

132
00:08:56,514 --> 00:08:58,573
That doesn't mean we can just let them die!

133
00:08:58,573 --> 00:08:59,598
This is a farce!

134
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:02,544
This isn't up for discussion.

135
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:05,507
And it happens to be your duty.

136
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,557
Take command of the detonation.

137
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:08,590
Finish it with your own hands.

138
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:10,576
Your motives are obvious.

139
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:12,541
You just want Kamui dead.

140
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,512
I'm doing this to protect society and Sibyl.

141
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:20,508
Unless we put an end to Kamui's attempts to 
destroy order, many more people are going to die.

142
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,558
Also...

143
00:09:21,558 --> 00:09:24,571
I received an unfortunate report just a moment ago.

144
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,597
Your grandmother Tsunemori Aoi's body was found in the warehouse district.

145
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,576
It appears that she was restrained and beaten to death.

146
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,589
A cruel crime, indeed.

147
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,506
I'll entrust the last trigger to you.

148
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:47,582
Protect the society that we call home.

149
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:51,528
I have faith in you, Inspector Tsunemori.

150
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:59,566
Kill Kamui, Tsunemori Akane.

151
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,529
Realize how powerless you are.

152
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,553
Give in to the desire to kill, 
and become your own person again.

153
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:11,513
Let it paint you black.

154
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,516
Are you going to kill him?

155
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:40,579
Blow it all up?!

156
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,575
And there's no need to watch facilities 
connected to the Tougane Foundation?

157
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:47,567
I was not made aware of those orders!

158
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,556
This is our top priority.

159
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:51,571
Have your Division stand by until further instructed.

160
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:54,518
Why the...

161
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:01,516
Time is of the essence here.

162
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:02,563
What's going on?

163
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,536
I don't know. Maybe I should do it.

164
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,526
This isn't like you.

165
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:13,508
You said it yourself, remember?

166
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:17,532
“The law doesn't protect people. People protect the law."

167
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:21,574
You believed in that enough to try to stop me, didn't you?

168
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,521
Yes, I did. But that was then.

169
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:28,527
Well, I guess I don't personally 
have a leg to stand on.

170
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,521
Sibyl can't judge Kamui,

171
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:33,588
but we have to stop him.

172
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:36,509
This is the only way.

173
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:37,589
You're wrong.

174
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:40,518
There's always another way.

175
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:42,543
The alternatives just haven't materialized yet.

176
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,599
All the pieces should already be in place.

177
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:47,565
You're just hesitating.

178
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:51,572
I can't afford to fail.

179
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,586
But...

180
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,532
Isn't it worth taking a chance?

181
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:57,582
Don't let them win.

182
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:06,533
Thank you.

183
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,571
What're you...

184
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,530
Kuwashima Kouichi.

185
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,588
I have a favor to ask.

186
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:28,535
Is this Kamui Kirito?

187
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,582
This is Tsunemori Akane from the 
Public Safety Bureau, CID, Division 1.

188
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,544
How's Kouichi doing?

189
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:41,524
He agreed to cooperate after I talked to him.

190
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:44,558
Sibyl is trying to bury you down there with the other passengers.

191
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:46,583
We'll find a way out before that happens.

192
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:53,500
In that case, all the Inspectors and Enforcers will stand in your way.

193
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,521
Is that supposed to scare me?

194
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,536
Kamui Kirito.

195
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:01,518
If you release your hostages, I'll grant your wish.

196
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,526
I've sent you a map of the underground.

197
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:06,512
Come to the location I've marked.

198
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:07,523
There, I'll...

199
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:10,535
What are you thinking?

200
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:12,585
The omnipotence paradox.

201
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:18,511
Kamui's goal is to judge the Sibyl System.

202
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:20,570
You should let it happen.

203
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,524
As a result, you'll be 
able to judge him as well.

204
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,580
You've been perfecting your judgments by 
taking in criminally asymptomatic people—

205
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,546
the ones you cannot judge.

206
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,552
However, a new exception has appeared.

207
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:39,589
Kamui exists as a collective entity, not as an individual.

208
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:47,539
Sibyl has no choice but to accept the concept that makes him valid in order to judge him.

209
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:51,519
You don't know what you're talking about.

210
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,544
That would require us to measure his Psycho-Pass as a collective entity.

211
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,515
But if that happens...

212
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:01,587
...Sibyl, as a collective entity itself, 
will also become judicable.

213
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,509
That was his goal.

214
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:08,566
By turning himself into a threat to society,

215
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:12,550
he creates a situation where you have no choice but to acknowledge a collective Psycho-Pass,

216
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,540
which then creates a paradox.

217
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,579
After all that, he judges you.

218
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,530
That's all the more reason why we can't allow him to get closer to Sibyl.

219
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,543
So you'll kill him without judging him?

220
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:28,535
By denying your own perfection?

221
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:33,509
You're too focused on the immediate objective to recognize the bigger picture.

222
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,569
How will society be affected once a 
collective Psycho-Pass is acknowledged?

223
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:44,586
Judging people as groups despite individual clarity will have its risks.

224
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:48,537
That much I understand.

225
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:53,500
But if you confront the problem you've been avoiding,

226
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,551
you will be able to evolve as well.

227
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,588
Contrary to what you seem to believe,

228
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:02,521
if you feign ignorance and choose the easy way out by killing Kamui,

229
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,568
then there's no future for the System.

230
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:10,519
I'm tired of listening to your pretentiousness.

231
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:15,564
If you're going to act on your own, 
I'll rescind your authority as an Inspector.

232
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:19,590
We'll have to think about removing you from society as well.

233
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:24,540
I'm saying your individual opinion doesn't matter, Tougane Misako!

234
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,562
Sibyl System...

235
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:37,554
You are allowed to exist in this society due to your ability to cast an equal and perfect judgment.

236
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:44,501
Now that there is an error in that perfection, one could say that the value of your existence has been called into question.

237
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:45,559
You don't know what you're talking about.

238
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:51,593
What will allow you to continue 
to serve a purpose in society?

239
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:55,510
Think over that carefully as a group.

240
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,548
Are you really sure about this?

241
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:05,555
Yes. Do it.

242
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,586
Roger!

243
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,569
This is for Aikawa, you bastards!

244
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:12,503
Die!

245
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,530
What's going on?

246
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,567
They aren't detonating.

247
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:27,564
Since the Bureau doesn't have its own explosives,

248
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:32,514
employing them requires you to use 
what's been seized from criminals.

249
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:37,510
There's only been one case that involved bombs in the past few months.

250
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,556
Kitazawa's bombs were fashioned such 
that we could override and control them.

251
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,532
Isn't that wonderful?

252
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:48,549
Kamui can see through everything.

253
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,553
That's exactly why he can make everyone clear.

254
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:55,539
All we need to do now is keep the Bureau here.

255
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,592
Kamui will make the world clear before long.

256
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:06,500
DRAINING WATER

257
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:06,500
DRAINING WATER

258
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:07,501
DRAINING WATER

259
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:07,501
DRAINING WATER

260
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,552
The water level has fallen!

261
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,589
They must've used a different wastewater facility.

262
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:33,595
The hostages have been released?

263
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:35,544
Roger that.

264
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:38,516
We'll make our way there to apprehend the culprits.

265
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,537
Inspector Shimotsuki!

266
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,579
No, this can't be...

267
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:42,550
Victim   : Tsunemori Aoi

268
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:42,550
Death from hemorrhagic shock resulting
 from external injuries caused by physical
 trauma

269
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,534
It's not my fault... It's not...

270
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:47,539
Inspector, what are you doing?!

271
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:49,559
Huh?

272
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,559
What's the matter?

273
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,584
Wh-Where's Enforcer Tougane?

274
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,569
Inspector.

275
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,544
Chief Kasei told me you'd be here.

276
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:11,540
Please let me come with you.

277
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,582
Why?

278
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:18,524
You must already know the connection between Kamui and Tougane Misako.

279
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:21,579
My mother created that monster.

280
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:24,584
The responsibility for correcting that falls to me, her son,

281
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:28,546
even if it means I have to bloody my own hands.

282
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,542
Are you going to kill Kamui?

283
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:35,533
Enforcer Kougami would have done it.

284
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:37,593
Let's go, Inspector.

285
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:44,523
Why don't you drop the act, Tougane?

286
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:49,540
The multi-body brain transplant your mother had performed on Kamui—

287
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,528
I know a certain system that 
makes use of the same concept.

288
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,589
Of course, she must've known about it too.

289
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,595
But no one in this society 
should be privy to that information...

290
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,537
TOUGANE MISAKO

291
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,537
TOUGANE MISAKO

292
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:04,516
except for the criminally asymptomatic.

293
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:09,563
If Tougane Misako was criminally asymptomatic, she must've been taken in by the system.

294
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:15,545
And, it's highly likely that she's been forced to oversee this whole matter.

295
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:22,521
In other words, the one who's acting as 
Chief Kasei right now is Tougane Misako.

296
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:26,590
I have no idea what you're talking about, Inspector.

297
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:30,512
I read up on your background.

298
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,578
Your real file's been hidden this whole time.

A lot of it was inconsistent with what we had on you,

318
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:42,533
so I looked into it again.

319
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,571
I see.

320
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:50,509
You drove all of your previous 
Inspectors to latent criminality.

321
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:52,521
To tell you the truth, 
I didn't want to believe it.

322
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:56,576
Or rather, I at least wanted to believe 
that you weren't doing it intentionally.

00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,568
Like Professor Saiga?

324
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:00,560
But you were different.

325
00:20:02,514 --> 00:20:04,582
Looking back on what you've said 
and how you've behaved,

326
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:08,589
your true intentions gradually become clearer.

327
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,528
You wanted to paint me black.

328
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:13,553
Isn't that right?

329
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:19,545
You aren't capable of clouding her.

330
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:26,587
Kamui Kirito.

331
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:33,543
This is perfect.

332
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:40,524
Your existence demeans my mother.

333
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,593
Crime Coefficient is 769.

334
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,547
Lethal Eliminator.

335
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:48,589
You don't deserve to exist!

336
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:52,540
All is calm, all is bright

337
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:51,556
Don't!

338
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:54,544
Begone, you pitch-black soul.

339
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,515
A whispering angel falls to Earth

340
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:06,587
Now it eats your body whole

341
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:11,583
It's my fault

342
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:25,539
You open your eyes

343
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:27,572
and in their grey-blue depth

344
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:30,514
I see your coldness

345
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,560
Call my name and give me a kiss

346
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,523
Embrace me

347
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:42,503
with your empty body

348
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,503
There is still life of sorts

349
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,503
There is still life of sorts

350
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,503
left within you

351
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,503
left within you

352
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,504
left within you

353
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,504
left within you

354
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:49,500
in blood red

355
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:50,500
in blood red

356
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:51,500
in blood red

357
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:52,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

358
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:53,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

359
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:54,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

360
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,500
You sing to me of it

361
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:56,500
You sing to me of it

362
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:57,500
What was I born for?

363
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,500
What was I born for?

364
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,501
What was I born for?

365
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:00,501
What was I born for?

366
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:01,501
What was I born for?

367
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:05,551
Love me

368
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,526
Don't let me go

369
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:08,501
Don't let me go

370
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:09,502
Don't let me go

371
