1
00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:02,590
You don't deserve to exist!

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,598
Don't!

3
00:00:04,534 --> 00:00:06,507
Begone, you pitch-black soul.

4
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:12,524
Crime Coefficient is 31. Not a target for enforcement action.

5
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:14,516
The trigger will be locked.

6
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:23,596
He's the reason your grandmother is dead!

7
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,509
Why are you protecting him?!

8
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:29,563
I don't think Kamui had anything to do with her murder.

9
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:33,544
Are you insane? He's the one 
who had her kidnapped!

10
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:37,581
I know he had the means to 
obtain information on my family,

11
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:41,581
but the same can be said about 
the people at the Bureau, too.

12
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:45,523
You'd put your own colleagues under the microscope before this criminal?

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,570
You're just afraid of clouding your Psycho-Pass,

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,582
so you're trying to ignore your hatred for him.

15
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:54,566
Your desire to kill won't just go away.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,525
I haven't always been able to protect the people I care about in the line of duty.

17
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,534
But still...

18
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:07,584
That doesn't mean I should 
give up on protecting the law.

19
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,512
Let's go.

20
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,522
Get back here, Tsunemori Akane!

21
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:15,585
Don't you dare mock me!

22
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:19,593
I won't let you disgrace my mother!

23
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,565
I will go insane

24
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:38,599
if the world keeps ruining my life

25
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,549
I've stopped breathing

26
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,508
from the nervousness every day

27
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:48,500
Enigmatic feeling

28
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:56,592
I have to be the aggressor

29
00:01:56,592 --> 00:01:59,559
The world has stopped making sense

30
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,547
It's dissolving

31
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:03,560
God has come to us

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,502
with sword in hand

33
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:10,585
The world has split in two

34
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:12,565
Half is mad,

35
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,565
and so am I

36
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:16,532
Where's the difference?

37
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:17,590
Where's the difference?

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,516
Only God can walk the borderline

39
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:24,583
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

40
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,537
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

41
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:31,550
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

42
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:34,579
I have no focus in my soul

43
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:38,542
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

44
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:41,547
I can't even look into the mirror

45
00:02:56,596 --> 00:02:58,507
Stand your ground!

46
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,520
Stop right there, Shisui!

47
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:12,559
I can still go on, Kamui!

48
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:15,543
A neuroactive drug? She'd go that far for him?

49
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:23,573
Soon, Kamui will change the world...

50
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,518
for us!

51
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,594
Why did you decide to show me the way?

52
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:32,561
So I can judge you the right way.

53
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:35,507
You could've gone outside the law for that.

54
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,557
That was never an option.

55
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:43,520
I can tell that that assertion 
is what's keeping you clear.

56
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:49,513
What do you expect Sibyl to do?

57
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:52,555
To bring an end to itself?

58
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:58,572
What is the right judgment in this “ideal” society where people are stripped of their humanity?

59
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,568
I want to see that thing judged!

60
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:06,548
There's another possibility.

61
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,519
You already...

62
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,527
Rather, all of you already know, right?

63
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:14,553
You may not get the answer you're looking for.

64
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:15,592
Will you still move forward?

65
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:19,541
I'm standing here now...

66
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,570
because I tried to find out why we died.

67
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,595
I wanted to find meaning in our undeath.

68
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:27,516
The hopes of many rest on us.

69
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,512
We are all suffering from the 
abuse they call “treatment.”

70
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:32,546
We must find peace.

71
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,567
Sibyl needs to be brought to justice.

72
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,555
That is our only path to salvation.

73
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:39,551
People's anger makes society clear.

74
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,509
This is a game...

75
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:44,531
between Sibyl and us!

76
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:50,576
You could've chosen a way that didn't mean becoming 
the champion of all those who hold a grudge against society.

77
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:54,515
That was never an option.

78
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:58,549
Even if I had been able to talk to you sooner.

79
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:07,566
Imagine my surprise when I discovered that 
my lab rat had caused such a commotion.

80
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,583
Tougane Misako.

81
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,560
They haven't come to a conclusion yet.

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,538
Am I wrong?

83
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:17,580
Tsunemori Akane, your rights as an Inspector have just been rescinded.

84
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,530
Now leave, and die like the dog you are.

85
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,578
First, I'll go beyond those doors 
and ask Sibyl if that's their answer.

86
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:28,504
Kamui?

87
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,540
Putting our lives on the line, we ask you:

88
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,511
Sibyl...

89
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,507
Can you see our color?

90
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,566
As long as I had Mother,

91
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,510
I didn't need anything else.

92
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,579
And yet...

93
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:58,596
I have to say goodbye to you, Sakuya.

94
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,572
I'm to join the entity that rules this society.

95
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:07,560
This is quite a wonderful thing.

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,514
You will eventually be led 
to the same place yourself.

97
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,550
Goodbye.

98
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,523
Sakuya?

99
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,561
You belong only to me!

100
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:38,575
...I got painted black.

101
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,526
Whether they're latent criminals, Enforcers,

102
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:46,572
or even the Inspectors you work with, you purposely 
cloud others' Hues and administer justice on them.

103
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,568
Why do you do that?

104
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:52,564
Because that's why I exist.

105
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:58,561
My role is to darken souls—even pure ones—
until they're pitch black.

106
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:02,586
That way, you can keep shining 
bright and beautiful, Mother.

107
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:05,561
I do it all out of love for you.

108
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:10,562
Mother...

109
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,534
Not a target for enforcement action.

110
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,576
The trigger will be locked.

111
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,528
It's no use.

112
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,594
Sibyl System.

113
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:39,523
If you fancy yourselves the god of judgment, there is only one choice before you.

114
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:45,519
The one you need to overcome in order to 
maintain the status quo is right in front of you!

115
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:47,566
Can you judge us?

116
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:49,512
What color are we?

117
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,508
What color are you?!

118
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,508
Crime Coefficient is over 300.

119
00:07:57,508 --> 00:08:00,500
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

120
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:05,542
So this is your color, is it, Tougane Misako?

121
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,539
I won't accept a change like this!

122
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,520
The time for judgment has come.

123
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,584
Crime Coefficient is over 300.

124
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:55,546
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

125
00:08:56,531 --> 00:08:59,531
So this is your color, Sibyl.

126
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:01,527
Welcome, Kamui Kirito.

127
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:08,507
Upon deliberation, we have decided to acknowledge all of you.

128
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:14,520
Additionally, as Tsunemori Akane suggested, 
we will introduce a collective Psycho-Pass.

129
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,552
Then, we will discard any elements that increase our Crime Coefficient.

130
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:30,563
We have obtained a new awareness and perfection now.

131
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:33,594
This is what evolving means for us.

132
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:40,543
Target's Threat Judgment has been updated.

133
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:41,598
Crime Coefficient is 0.

134
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:44,569
Not a target for enforcement action.

135
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,594
The trigger will be locked.

136
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:49,544
There's your answer.

137
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:50,598
Kamui Kirito...

138
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,516
You are under arrest.

139
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,542
Go!

140
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:21,570
Surrender! It's all over!

141
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:25,573
Stop this!

142
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:27,523
Shisui!

143
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:30,519
No... It's not over yet.

144
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:35,557
I'll be the path for Kamui.

145
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:41,508
Thanks to the bombs that Division 3 took such care in planting,

146
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,504
you'll the ones meeting your end here!

147
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:45,526
Don't!

148
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:47,567
Thank you...

149
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,510
Kamui.

150
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:58,551
Sorry I was late.

151
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,590
No kidding.

152
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:06,594
But you made it this time.

153
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:09,515
Yes.

154
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,557
It's okay. She's still alive.

155
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:19,526
We got your lieutenant back, Aoyanagi.

156
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:25,537
We're in the middle of an operation.

157
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:26,596
Shut up and do as I say!

158
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,542
You're an Inspector. You should know my location!

159
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,500
Get over here!

160
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:40,505
Mother...

161
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,582
Things can't stay like this.

162
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:54,500
This is all his fault.

163
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,503
It's him...

164
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,574
The Chief's ordered me to handle a different task.

165
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:03,545
You Enforcers, follow Inspector Doumoto's orders!

166
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:05,505
“A different task”?

167
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:10,554
Crime Coefficient is 400.

168
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:13,586
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

169
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:19,526
What color am I now?

170
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,522
Inspector Tsunemori.

171
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:24,518
It is recommended that you administer justice immediately.

172
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:27,569
Do not resist, and hand over that Dominator.

173
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:29,582
I can feel it.

174
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:34,515
Even as a part of that thing, some of them are happy to have their own color back.

175
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,515
Happy?

176
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:39,554
Why aren't you pointing that Dominator at Sibyl?

177
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:42,530
As a collective entity,

178
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,504
it encapsulates the one who wields the Dominator.

179
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,558
If someone else points it at them,

180
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:51,554
it may show a different color.

181
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:53,579
You...

182
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,571
Sibyl can't turn back now.

183
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,530
No matter how many brains it removes,

184
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,524
Sibyl's Crime Coefficient may remain high when a true judge appears someday.

185
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,573
This was your plan from the start?

186
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:14,515
Administer justice, Inspector Tsunemori.

187
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:16,519
Maybe that judge is actually...

188
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:20,561
the one who stands before me right now.

189
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:23,512
Stop it.

190
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,576
I'm not like you.

191
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:29,504
I don't live to satisfy anyone else's expectations.

192
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:34,559
If you had only found a way to do this without getting anyone hurt!

193
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,514
That was never an option.

194
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:42,513
Get out of there!

195
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,555
Desecrators!

196
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:46,510
Stop it!

197
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,581
I like the look in your eyes.

198
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,520
You know, don't you?

199
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,502
I was the one who killed Tsunemori Aoi.

200
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:59,572
She put up a pretty good fight for a shriveled old hag.

201
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:04,574
She kept calling your name. “Akane, Akane”...

202
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,542
There's another option.

203
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,529
You know it too, don't you?

204
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,590
You believe the spirit of 
the law should be respected.

205
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:25,580
If the spirit—not the letter—of the law were given the opportunity to weigh the scales of justice,

206
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:31,528
it may allow that monster to become a real god someday.

207
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:40,586
This isn't possible!

208
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:44,561
There's no way you can be purer than my mother!

209
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:13,571
Why isn't your soul turning black?!

210
00:15:14,553 --> 00:15:16,540
Tougane Sakuya.

211
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,554
You're under arrest for committing acts of rebellion 
and for the murder of Tsunemori Aoi.

212
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,529
Inspector Tsunemori Akane.

213
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,538
It is gratifying that, following your suggestion,

214
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:46,538
we have solved the problems we had been discussing among ourselves throughout this ordeal.

215
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:48,592
However, with our current processing ability,

216
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:54,510
we cannot judge the collective 
Psycho-Pass of this society quite yet.

217
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:01,538
In order for that day to come, we recommend that you continue to contribute to society and live a healthy life.

218
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:11,536
So you came.

219
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:15,544
Crime Coefficient is 899.

220
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:18,587
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

221
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:21,538
You're no child of Sibyl.

222
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:22,562
You're pitch black.

223
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,584
Mother...

224
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,562
In the end, you and I were merely slaves to Sibyl.

225
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:36,568
I can't forgive myself for obeying you.

226
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:39,577
I can't keep myself clear unless I do this.

227
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:49,518
So she's your new slave, huh?

228
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:57,566
Do everything you can, and live only to keep Sibyl beautiful.

229
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,563
Someone like you who would cloud my Psycho-Pass should disappear.

230
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:13,526
I won't go any further than this.

231
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:15,527
I'll keep the secret.

232
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:18,531
No, I'll forget everything!

233
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:19,577
I don't know anything!

234
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:23,536
I trust Sibyl!

235
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:27,569
I love this society!

236
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,590
Tsunemori Akane!

237
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,524
I've been informed that your rights as an Inspector have been rescinded for disobeying orders!

238
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:37,592
Do not resist, and put your hands behind your...

239
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:38,575
Don't!

240
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:39,570
Stop it!

241
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:43,524
H-Her rights have been reinstated.

242
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,563
What color am I now?

243
00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:02,512
As clear as crystal.

244
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,502
I located the escaped Enforcer Tougane Sakuya.

245
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,550
He died before I administered justice. That concludes my report.

246
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,545
Well, thanks for seeing me off.

247
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:20,532
Your Psycho-Pass is on its way to recovery.

248
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,591
You don't have to...

249
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:24,562
I know why it's recovering.

250
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,513
Being dependent doesn't quite suit me, though.

251
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,506
I'll come see you again!

252
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:36,509
Looking forward to it.

253
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,527
A man who clouds the Psycho-Pass of anyone he touches, huh?

254
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:45,527
Now that he's gone, I feel like I've missed my chance.

255
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,548
According to Kuwashima,

256
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:54,520
Tougane Sakuya was the one who leaked the 
information on Inspector Tsunemori's grandmother.

257
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:59,582
But now we'll never find out where he got that info in the first place.

258
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,587
That's unfortunate.

259
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,579
I'll never forgive the one responsible.

260
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:11,566
Neither will I.

261
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:18,564
Now that this whole affair is over, 
we have many vacancies in the system.

262
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:22,572
To tell you the truth, some of us suggested that we bring you in.

263
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:27,515
If change is what you strive for, 
why don't you try instituting it from the inside?

264
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,590
I know you're not that interested in me.

265
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,504
Are you trying to provoke me?

266
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:35,574
Are you turning it down?

267
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,560
For now, yes.

268
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,542
When you decide for yourselves that it's time to oust the system,

269
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,587
I'll go to hell with you.

270
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:46,525
A collective Psycho-Pass...

271
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:51,559
In the not-so-distant future, there will be a society in which groups become the standard unit for judgment.

272
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,526
When confronted with the idea that a group isn't clear despite the clarity of each individual,

273
00:19:57,551 --> 00:20:00,535
the resulting doubts and fears could lead to chaos.

274
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,547
People all over society may become targets in an unprecedented witch hunt.

275
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:05,548
As a result,

276
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,580
judgments may turn into massacres.

277
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:14,544
And you're the one who opened the door.

278
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:17,524
I'm not that pessimistic.

279
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:22,587
What comes of this may be righteous law and order, and peace and freedom.

280
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:26,500
You're as idealistic as ever.

281
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:30,592
Maybe it's idealistic, but we can't know unless we try.

282
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,594
It is not society that determines people's futures.

283
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:37,514
It is people who determine society's future.

284
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,590
That's what I believe.

285
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:44,510
All is calm, all is bright

286
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,585
A whispering angel falls to Earth

287
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:58,557
Now it eats your body whole

288
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:03,553
It's my fault

289
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,509
You open your eyes

290
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,542
and in their grey-blue depth

291
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,584
I see your coldness

292
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:24,530
Call my name and give me a kiss

293
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,593
Embrace me

294
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:33,573
with your empty body

295
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:36,532
There is still life of sorts

296
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:40,565
left within you

297
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,553
in blood red

298
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:46,524
I can see a brilliant eternity

299
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:48,550
You sing to me of it

300
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,542
What was I born for?

301
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:57,563
Love me

302
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:01,551
Don't let me go

303
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:19,582
