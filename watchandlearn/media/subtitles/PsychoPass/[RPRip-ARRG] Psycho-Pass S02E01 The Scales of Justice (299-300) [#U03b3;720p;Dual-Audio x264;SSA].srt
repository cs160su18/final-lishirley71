1
00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:05,027
Psycho-Pass treatment has evolved to the next level!

2
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:08,098
If your Hue takes a turn for the worse due to stress or mental disorders,

3
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:14,062
you could find yourself at risk of becoming a latent criminal and end up relocated to a rehabilitation facility.

4
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:19,095
However, with the new psychotropic medicine Lacouse, you have nothing to fear!

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,003
however

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,003
however

7
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,004
Lacouse

8
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,004
Lacouse

9
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,004
Lacouse

10
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,004
Lacouse

11
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,004
Lacouse

12
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,004
Lacouse

13
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,004
Lacouse

14
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,004
Lacouse

15
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,004
Lacouse

16
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,004
Lacouse

17
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,004
Lacouse

18
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,004
Lacouse

19
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,004
Lacouse

20
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,004
Lacouse

21
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:21,096
This is Lacouse!

22
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:25,046
Lacouse is available in six varieties, each designed to treat a specific type of stress that may be clouding your Hue.

23
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:24,025
Please give it a try!

24
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:30,071
Its unique ingredient, Admin, powerfully blocks undesirable mental substances.

25
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:28,025
This is Lacouse! Please give it a try!

26
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:31,097
Lacouse is all new. Please give it a try!

27
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:34,034
With Lacouse, you can keep your Psycho-Pass clear!

28
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:34,034
This is Lacouse!

29
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,047
This is Lacouse! Please give it a try!

30
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,083
At precisely 6 PM this evening,

31
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:09,092
someone posted a video claiming responsibility for this attack on a major web-streaming site,

32
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:12,026
which matches the MO 
of the last three incidents.

33
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:15,084
We're being deceived by the Sibyl System.

34
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:23,048
Right after the explosion, a cymatic scan of the crime scene detected an individual whose Hue had suddenly clouded.

35
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:19,081
“A system that makes everyone happy”?
 Don't make me laugh.

36
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:22,077
Getting pigeonholed and allowing our futures to be determined by a machine

37
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:24,069
is no way for humans to live.

38
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:28,019
The government is treating its citizens like cogs in a machine!

39
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,019
Suddenly clouded?

40
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:31,082
And OW Pharmaceuticals, the distributor of Lacouse,

41
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:34,015
Karanomori, run a match between 
that individual and the man in the video.

42
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:34,015
is simply milking this demented system.

43
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,020
If we extrapolate his vocal cords via his bone structure

44
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,012
and overlay the result on the voice in the video...

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,095
Bingo.

46
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:46,058
The man's name is Kitazawa Akira.

47
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:48,096
He's an on-site supervisor for a demolition company.

48
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:51,005
A demolition worker...

49
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:53,042
So he's an expert on explosives.

50
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:59,009
Please superimpose Kitazawa's 
movements over the detailed area map.

51
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,039
Roger.

52
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,039
We'll let the Drones handle the on-site inspection.

53
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,019
Inspector Shimotsuki, please change our route.

54
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,044
Understood.

55
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,026
This is where Kitazawa's employer stores its equipment.

56
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:45,064
A camera caught him entering 
the building 20 minutes ago.

57
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:50,073
He also hinted in the video 
that he's got more bombs.

58
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:53,015
Things couldn't be worse.

59
00:02:53,015 --> 00:03:00,020
Yeah. With the citizens already on edge, 
the Area Stress Level could rise in an instant.

60
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:04,037
We'll be coordinating with Division 2.

61
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:06,016
Ginoza.

62
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:09,062
Please assist Inspector Shimotsuki.

63
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:10,083
Roger.

64
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,056
Enforcer Tougane, Enforcer Hinakawa.

65
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:32,027
Sorry you have to start off with such a demanding case.

66
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:34,073
Try to be careful out there.

67
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:37,069
Understood.

68
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:46,062
Dominator Portable Psychological Diagnosis and Suppression System has been activated.

69
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:50,066
User authentication: Inspector Tsunemori Akane.

70
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,058
Affiliation: Public Safety Bureau, 
Criminal Investigation Department.

71
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,004
Dominator usage approval confirmed.

72
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,000
You are a valid user.

73
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:16,069
I will go insane

74
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,003
if the world keeps ruining my life

75
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:23,053
I've stopped breathing

76
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:26,012
in view of the end of days

77
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:28,004
Enigmatic feeling

78
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:36,096
I have to be the aggressor

79
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:39,063
The world has stopped making sense

80
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:41,051
It's dissolving

81
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:43,063
God has come to us

82
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:46,005
with sword in hand

83
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:50,089
The world has split in two

84
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,068
Half is mad,

85
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,069
and so am I

86
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,036
Where's the difference?

87
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,094
Where's the difference?

88
00:04:57,094 --> 00:05:01,019
Only God can walk the borderline

89
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:04,086
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

90
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:08,041
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

91
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:11,054
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

92
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:14,083
I have no focus in my soul

93
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:18,046
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

94
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:21,051
I can't even look into the mirror

95
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,001
the scales of justice

96
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,001
the scales of justice

97
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,002
the scales of justice

98
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,002
the scales of justice

99
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,002
the scales of justice

100
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,002
the scales of justice

101
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:34,064
Inspector.

102
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:34,002
the scales of justice

103
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:34,002
the scales of justice

104
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:38,061
Why are we just standing by instead of moving in?

105
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:43,099
Why do you think that Kitazawa's Psycho-Pass 
didn't get clouded by any of the previous bombings?

106
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,082
Kitazawa is a supervisor at demolition sites.

107
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:50,024
Making bombs wouldn't exactly
be stressful for someone like him.

108
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:53,029
Well, it's not quite the same
when done in service of his job.

109
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:56,008
No one asked you, Enforcer.

110
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:03,046
Normally, one's Psycho-Pass would be 
exacerbated by planning a terrorist attack.

111
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:08,043
There's no way to keep one's Hue clear while preparing an array of bombs.

112
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:14,039
But in this case, Kitazawa's Psycho-Pass 
only dropped after the bombs were set off.

113
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,086
In other words, he previously had 
some means of keeping his Hue clear.

114
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,082
Is that important right now?

115
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:26,011
Will that information help us resolve this case?

116
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,078
Inspector Tsunemori.

117
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:31,074
I'm in favor of moving in as well.

118
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:34,020
This is the Public Safety Bureau.

119
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,091
We are issuing an Area Stress Level warning.

120
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,017
The Area Stress Levels have gotten 
precariously high since these bombings started.

121
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:38,079
To all residents:

122
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,025
Please stay indoors and focus on managing your stress.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,038
We need to take care of this bomber 
before new latent criminals are created.

124
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,038
I repeat: This is...

125
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,063
But...

126
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:47,084
We shouldn't waste time.

127
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:49,080
Division 2, move in!

128
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,018
Please wait!

129
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:53,051
We should move with them, Inspector.

130
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,051
No.

131
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,077
Why?!

132
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:58,073
Please listen, Inspector Aoyanagi.

133
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,019
These serial bombings have yielded no casualties.

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,099
I can only conclude that the culprit has taken care to avoid harming citizens.

135
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,095
That being the case, what could he be after?

136
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:14,087
If you consider the potential fallout of an explosion,

137
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:17,041
one thing you can count on is an elevated Area Stress Level.

138
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:19,054
It's awfully cold.

139
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:25,080
It's also a sure bet that the 
Public Safety Bureau will pursue the culprit.

140
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,076
Does that mean...

141
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:33,018
It's very likely that the culprit is provoking us 
and is waiting in ambush inside.

142
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,069
Looks like you were right, Inspector Tsunemori.

143
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:58,045
Let's go, Yamatoya!

144
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,045
Roger!

145
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:06,017
Keep your guard up, Inspector Shimotsuki.

146
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,084
You don't have to tell me that!

147
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,059
Don't let him get away!

148
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,068
It's on autodrive?

149
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:20,002
Watch out!

150
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:28,036
Just a decoy.

151
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:31,057
Are you okay, Inspector?

152
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,074
Thank you.

153
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:41,016
Inspector!

154
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,080
I-I'm enforcing justice!

155
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,077
Wait! He's got a hostage!

156
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:09,057
Inspector Tsunemori!

157
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:11,028
Take a look at this guy's back.

158
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:18,066
Tougane and Hinakawa, I want you to go after the culprit.

159
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,070
I'll handle this.

160
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,000
What?

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,054
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

162
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:26,088
She should be using the Enforcers as a shield!

163
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,030
Target's Threat Judgment has been updated.

164
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,097
Enforcement mode is Destroy Decomposer.

165
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:42,093
Target will be completely eliminated.

166
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:44,089
Please exercise caution.

167
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,004
Are you okay, Inspector?

168
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,088
We're going after the culprit. Move out!

169
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:13,076
Excuse me for worrying about you...

170
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:29,052
Enforcers' hands are tied without an accompanying Inspector.

171
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:31,082
I'm sure you're aware of that!

172
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,079
The culprit is currently on Route 20 heading toward Shinjuku.

173
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,075
We'll limit his escape routes and 
drive him into the Yoyogi Park area.

174
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:55,051
Inspector Shimotsuki, please work with the Enforcers to help residents evacuate the neighborhood.

175
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:59,022
What, are you afraid that my 
Psycho-Pass will get clouded?

176
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,018
Don't underestimate me.

177
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:08,056
I have a year and a half of experience as an Inspector under my belt.

178
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:11,090
I'm plenty capable of keeping my Psycho-Pass clear.

179
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:14,065
She sure is confident.

180
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,099
This is Shisui from Division 2.

181
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:21,011
The situation has changed.

182
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,083
It appears the culprit has released 
the woman he was holding hostage.

183
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,029
The timing doesn't seem right.

184
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,075
I agree with you.

185
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:33,021
Karanomori.

186
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:36,017
Right here. I was wondering when you'd call.

187
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:45,018
Oh? Now this is a surprise.

188
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:49,039
The hostage that's walking away from the culprit...

189
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:55,011
No such person exists.

190
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:57,082
She's a hologram?

191
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:00,061
This is probably...

192
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:01,095
A trap?

193
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,007
Yes.

194
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,058
Despite the fact that Kitazawa was an excellent student,

195
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:14,029
his path to elite status hit a dead end when his occupational aptitude assessment revealed that his Hue was easily clouded.

196
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:21,051
Considering his past, that video, 
and his actions at the warehouse,

197
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:26,047
I'd say he's trying to retaliate against society...

198
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,043
by attacking the Public Safety Bureau.

199
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:35,044
The most effective way to eliminate us, his pursuers,

200
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:38,048
is to draw us in by releasing his hostage.

201
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:42,040
All that awaits us once we catch up to her...

202
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:44,057
is a bomb.

203
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:49,091
So he set this trap in order lure us out into the open where he could kill us?

204
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:55,013
Inspector Shisui, please locate and extract the bomb, and leave the culprit to us.

205
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,009
Understood. Consider it done.

206
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:21,032
Crime Coefficient is 302.

207
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:22,053
A target for enforcement action.

208
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:27,032
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

209
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:31,058
Aim carefully and eliminate the target.

210
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,091
Stay back!

211
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,058
Please, no!

212
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,058
Mommy!

213
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:46,089
Oh, no!

214
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:48,035
Inspector?

215
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:50,035
Hinakawa, get back!

216
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,073
A-Are you okay?

217
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,086
Wait!

218
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:11,024
It's not too late for him.

219
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:15,050
299.

220
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:24,076
I see. 299, huh?

221
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:27,005
Tsunemori sure is something.

222
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:28,005
That's...

223
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,022
Let's go.

224
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:30,097
We'll back up the Inspector.

225
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:40,086
What's the matter?! Why don't you just shoot already if that's what's right?!

226
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:42,069
I won't.

227
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:46,086
If I shoot you now, this gun will kill you.

228
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,062
Attention, please.

229
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:53,062
This is the Criminal Investigation Department,
part of the Public Safety Bureau.

230
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,012
Please evacuate immediately!

231
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:57,091
We are currently providing evacuation assistance in response to an emergency situation.

232
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:55,050
This way!

233
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:58,008
Please don't panic!

234
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:59,058
Please follow instructions and evacuate.

235
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,058
Why do I have to do this?

236
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:03,004
What are you doing, Ginoza?

237
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:08,013
Our goal is to eliminate the culprit.

238
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:09,063
Tsunemori is...

239
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,089
willing to take a chance.

240
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:17,073
Could you overlook her foolishness for the time being?

241
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:20,044
You've changed.

242
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,094
It's only natural after having 
worked with her for so long.

243
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:30,003
Ginoza, an Enforcer from Division 2 is heading to the adjacent building.

244
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:34,020
Wait!

245
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,070
What the heck is going on?

246
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:43,063
So that's what she meant by “299”?

247
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:48,001
She's unbelievable! Is this really 
appropriate behavior for an Inspector?

248
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:52,022
If you just avert your eyes and 
forsake those you don't understand,

249
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:54,060
you'll come to regret it someday.

250
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:58,006
Recognize what's happening before your eyes as fact.

251
00:15:58,006 --> 00:16:01,056
That's a shortcut to becoming an adult, missy.

252
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:14,012
S-Stay back!

253
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:23,054
We're controlled by the society that Sibyl created!

254
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:25,092
Doesn't that bother you?!

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,030
Our potential and our future are decided for us!

256
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,030
Only a select few reap any benefit from the system!

257
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,047
Does that mean the rest of us aren't needed?!

258
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:40,023
No, it doesn't.

259
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:41,056
You are needed.

260
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:44,044
And so are the bombs that you made.

261
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:47,015
What are you saying, Inspector?!

262
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:51,061
Society doesn't always do what's right.

263
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:55,099
That's precisely why it's up to us 
as individuals to live virtuous lives.

264
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,074
I...

265
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:07,004
Your expertise and desire to right a wrong are both needed in this society.

266
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:11,080
Society is comprised of individuals.

267
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:16,005
The virtue of the individual is ultimately what makes the society itself virtuous.

268
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,039
Your sense of justice is noble.

269
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:23,048
You're not just a cog in the machine.

270
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:26,019
Even if society oppresses you,

271
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:28,044
as long as you have the spirit to resist,

272
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,040
you are a human being.

273
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:33,036
Tougane...

274
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:39,028
What the hell's taking them so long?

275
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:39,028
Crime Coefficient is over 140.

276
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:42,008
An Enforcer registered at the CID.

277
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:44,021
This target has Enforce At Will status.

278
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:49,013
Put the gun down!

279
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,088
Ginoza.

280
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,001
What on earth is going on?

281
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:12,003
Crime Coefficient is 299.

282
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:15,003
Target's Threat Judgment has been updated.

283
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:18,099
Enforcement mode is Non-Lethal Paralyzer.

284
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,070
Aim calmly and disable the target.

285
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:27,046
I'm enforcing justice.

286
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,076
It was thanks to all of you.

287
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,031
Thank you very much.

288
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:54,069
An enforcement target's Crime Coefficient rarely goes down.

289
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:58,007
To think that you'd build your strategy around it all the same...

290
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:02,041
Sibyl had decided he wasn't worthy of living!

291
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,070
And yet...

292
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:10,004
But in the end, Sibyl reversed that decision.

293
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:16,013
We need to find out how he was able to 
keep his Hue clear while making those bombs.

294
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:19,047
I made a judgment call with 
the future in mind. That's all.

295
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:24,085
Inspector.

296
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,089
You're...

297
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:29,085
wrong.

298
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:33,014
All is calm, all is bright

299
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:39,076
A whispering angel falls to Earth

300
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:47,063
Now it eats your body whole

301
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:52,073
It's my fault

302
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:05,096
You open your eyes

303
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,041
and in their grey-blue depth

304
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,092
I see your coldness

305
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:13,027
Call my name and give me a kiss

306
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:15,091
Embrace me

307
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:22,074
with your empty body

308
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:25,016
There is still life of sorts

309
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:29,061
left within you

310
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,027
in blood red

311
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:35,005
I can see a brilliant eternity

312
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:37,023
You sing to me of it

313
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:42,029
What was I born for?

314
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:46,094
Love me

315
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:50,063
Don't let me go

316
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,029
Don't tell me... It's a Holo?!

317
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:17,021
The fact that something is false 
does not invalidate its existence.

318
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:19,046
You all failed to recognize that.

319
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,001
That's why...

320
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:36,044
I am here.

321
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,040
Crime Coefficient is 48.

322
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,036
An Inspector registered at the CID.

323
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:46,032
Warning: Any rebellious conduct by Enforcers
will be recorded and reported to headquarters.

324
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,016
Stop...

325
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,089
That's right. It was a new start.

326
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:15,002
The start of my own internal struggle to determine who I am.

327
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:46,067
This is a world where the mental state and personal tendencies of humans can be quantified. While all sorts of inclinations are recorded and policed, these measured numbers used to judge people's souls are commonly called "Psycho-Pass".
