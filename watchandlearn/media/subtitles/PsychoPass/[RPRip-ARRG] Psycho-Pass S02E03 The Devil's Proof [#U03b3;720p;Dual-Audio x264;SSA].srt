1
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:31,584
There are times when sensory overload works to purify one's Hue

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,546
even better than trying to maintain calm.

3
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:38,531
Wh-Who's there?

4
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:46,508
No!

5
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:49,571
Sorry.

6
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:53,532
I really needed an eye from an Inspector.

7
00:00:56,535 --> 00:01:01,533
Crime Coefficient is 129. 
A target for enforcement action.

8
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:08,521
No! No!

9
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,522
Your fear will end soon, Shisui Mizue.

10
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:17,543
I'll make you clear to atone for taking your eye.

11
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:22,517
I understand very well how you are suffering.

12
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:26,536
Your worries about your Hue 
worsening every time a crime occurs.

13
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:30,557
Your fears toward Enforcers, 
who may turn on you at any time...

14
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:34,532
The only one holding you back is yourself.

15
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,555
You have the strength to accept any circumstances.

16
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:43,550
But, that's precisely why you've been suffering.

17
00:01:57,522 --> 00:02:00,577
Now, I'm going to release you from yourself—

18
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:02,588
from Sibyl.

19
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,539
Remember...

20
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,562
Remember the true you from long ago.

21
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:09,548
The one you've come to forget.

22
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:15,586
Target's Thread Judgment has been updated.

23
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:18,586
Crime Coefficient is 85.

24
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:21,539
Not a target for enforcement action.

25
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:26,591
Who are you?

26
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:29,540
My name is Kamui Kirito.

27
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,526
I want to make you and this world clear.

28
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,597
So clear that they're completely invisible.

29
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:39,501

30
00:02:57,074 --> 00:03:00,069
I will go insane

31
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,503
if the world keeps ruining my life

32
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:02,553
I've stopped breathing

33
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:05,512
from the nervousness every day

34
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:07,503
Enigmatic feeling

35
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:15,596
I have to be the aggressor

36
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,563
The world has stopped making sense

37
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:20,551
It's dissolving

38
00:03:19,596 --> 00:03:22,563
God has come to us

39
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:25,505
with sword in hand

40
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,589
The world has split in two

41
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,568
Half is mad,

42
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:33,569
and so am I

43
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,535
Where's the difference?

44
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:36,594
Where's the difference?

45
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:40,519
Only God can walk the borderline

46
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:43,586
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

47
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:47,541
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

48
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:50,554
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

49
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,583
I have no focus in my soul

50
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,546
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

51
00:03:57,546 --> 00:04:00,550
I can't even look into the mirror

52
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:10,502
the devil's proof

53
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:10,502
the devil's proof

54
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,502
the devil's proof

55
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,502
the devil's proof

56
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:12,502
the devil's proof

57
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:12,502
the devil's proof

58
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:13,502
the devil's proof

59
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:13,502
the devil's proof

60
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:18,553
In any case, this place is quite a mess.

61
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:21,516
Excuse me for not being more organized.

62
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:25,587
Inspector, it may not be too late. 
Therapy could still help you.

63
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:29,583
You mean to say that I wrote 
this myself, Inspector Shimotsuki?

64
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:33,560
The scans for this area didn't detect anyone suspicious,

65
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,568
which means no one else entered your apartment.

66
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,572
You'd believe the same thing, Ginoza?

67
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,530
That I lost my mind and wrote this?

68
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:48,597
Then point your Dominator at me and check my Hue.

69
00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:50,535
That's...

70
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:00,573
What are you doing?

71
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:03,521
Didn't you just hear him say 
that no one else has been here?

72
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:06,530
There's no way that someone could've broken in.

73
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:13,513
But there's also no reason to think that the Inspector lost her mind.

74
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:17,510
So as things stand, we're faced with two impossible scenarios.

75
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:20,568
But one of them must have happened.

76
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:23,555
If the chances of each having occurred are equally probable,

77
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:26,576
Enforcers should trust the Inspector.

78
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:28,548
Tougane...

79
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:37,561
According to protocol, your family should be moved to a 

safe location and put under the protection of Guard Drones.

80
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,099
Though I have my doubts about how necessary a measure that is.

81
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,575
I guess my parents will be moved to a nearby Bureau facility,

82
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,587
although it might be difficult for my grandma.

83
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:50,537
Difficult?

84
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:52,563
She can't move.

85
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,579
I see.

86
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:58,584
Take a right at the next exit.

87
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,597
But the Bureau is straight ahead.

88
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:03,570
There's a stop I want to make first.

89
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:08,501
You could've just dropped me off and headed back.

90
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:11,527
What business does an Inspector have at an isolation facility?

91
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:14,598
I have a duty to find out.

92
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:18,544
This is a surprise. You're not 
exactly who I was expecting.

93
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,565
Saiga Jouji?!

94
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,526
You know him?

95
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,512
Yeah... I've seen his file.

96
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:34,528
Please excuse me, Inspector. 
I don't feel well, so I'm going to head back.

97
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,571
That girl seems quite scared of me.

98
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,526
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,568
The clearer one's Psycho-Pass is, 
the more they're afraid of having it clouded by others.

100
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:49,589
She must've thought that talking to me would raise her Crime Coefficient.

101
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:52,585
That's only natural for someone who's read my file.

102
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,585
You think so?

103
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:58,557
The outlier here is you.

104
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:00,523
You should realize that.

105
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:06,524
But my Psycho-Pass has never been clouded by talking to you, Professor Saiga.

106
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,502
Fair enough.

107
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:12,545
Well, then. What brings you here?

108
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,559
Please tell me...

109
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:17,542
Do I appear sane to you?

110
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:27,555
A message no one could've written, huh?

111
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:29,576
Right, save for one person.

112
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:35,573
True. Writing a message in your own room 
without it being logged would be a simple matter.

113
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,566
I see.

114
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:42,590
You want to use me as a mirror, then?

115
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:49,533
What you're after is probably better 
left in the hands of someone healthier.

116
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,572
I'm not suited for the job.

117
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:55,529
I don't know anyone better suited than you.

118
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:56,595
Good grief...

119
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,555
Well, then. First, tell me the answer.

120
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,579
You figured out what the message means, correct?

121
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:05,576
Yes. I'm convinced now that I've heard what he said.

122
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:12,514
Hey, tell me. What color am I now?

123
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:15,573
“WC” stands for “What color”.

124
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:19,506
“What color”?

125
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,569
That's a strange question in this day and age.

126
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:27,573
Right. If “color” suggests Hue, I don't see the point in asking humans such a thing.

127
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,581
A checker is all you'd need to verify that.

128
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:35,557
Let's start from the beginning. 
Who is the message for?

129
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:40,571
Someone at the scene as the crime took place, or the Bureau's people who would see it later,

130
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:41,567
or...

131
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,588
...a question asked inwardly.

132
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:50,513
One commonality between the two messages

133
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:55,506
is that neither could've been written by anyone but the Inspector at the scene.

134
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:59,506
Inspector Aoyanagi said it'd have to be a ghost.

135
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,504
A ghost who lost sight of its color 
and is searching for an answer about it?

136
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:05,552
Sounds like a fairy tale.

137
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:08,574
Could you tell me what you think?

138
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:15,564
A missing Inspector and messages that logically can't exist.

139
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:18,575
I'm going to investigate this case,

140
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,567
but I'm sure to have my work cut out for me.

141
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:25,555
So you thought you'd pay this old geezer 
a visit for some help, huh?

142
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:26,581
I'm flattered.

143
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:30,534
You're the only one who can help me.

144
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,597
Then let's start with the irrefutable facts of the case—

145
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:39,581
the events that are rooted in reality.

146
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,527
The messages written on the walls,

147
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:46,561
and the decrease in Kitazawa's Crime Coefficient.

148
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:51,582
Very well. Next, let's identify the elements that are only conjecture at this point.

149
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:56,520
The existence of a person who 
bypassed scans and wrote the messages,

150
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,529
and the existence of Kamui, who supposedly lowered Kitazawa's Crime Coefficient.

151
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,562
That's right.

152
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:05,504
But even if this Kamui doesn't exist,

153
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:11,547
the person who wrote the messages and the means of lowering Kitazawa's Crime Coefficient do.

154
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:17,597
It's called the Devil's Proof.

155
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,508
The Devil's Proof?

156
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:27,520
At this point, there's no way to prove that this ghost exists,

157
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,565
but at the same time, we aren't able to disprove its existence, either.

158
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,506
In other words, I don't know what to do.

159
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:38,558
Then if we can prove its existence, we can move forward, right?

160
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:41,508
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

161
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:46,528
Inspector Shisui from Division 2 is still missing and believed to be acting on her own.

162
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:50,531
Don't you have some thoughts on that?

163
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:56,515
After all, you felt compelled to turn yourself in 
out of guilt after helping Kougami.

164
00:10:57,502 --> 00:11:01,552
Do you think I'm the type to be swayed by appeals to the heart?

165
00:11:01,597 --> 00:11:05,586
You know the value of trying to do all one can despite overwhelming odds.

166
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:07,552
That's the kind of person you are.

167
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:10,544
You are an excellent student.

168
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:13,507
It's all thanks to your guidance.

169
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:23,575
Care for a drink? My father left this bottle behind.

170
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:27,579
Are you joking? I'm an Inspector.

171
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,525
You're also human.

172
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:33,544
Are you okay?

173
00:11:33,544 --> 00:11:36,576
That sounds sarcastic. How can I be okay?

174
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:43,514
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:44,560
It's all right.

176
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,593
After ten years of service as an Inspector,

177
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:50,528
there's a position waiting for you 
at the Ministry of Welfare.

178
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:53,588
My life from that point on would've been so secure.

179
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:57,501
But life isn't that simple.

180
00:11:58,524 --> 00:11:59,553
Are you being sarcastic?

181
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,574
What?

182
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:03,545
That's kind of a sore subject for me now.

183
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,561
I guess it must be.

184
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,597
I wonder where I screwed up.

185
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:18,566
When I assisted Division 1 in Kougami's escape?

186
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,539
Or when I shot that man?

187
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:24,522
You mean that Enforcer?

188
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,512
You shouldn't blame yourself.

189
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:31,506
It's an Inspector's duty to shoot a deserting Enforcer.

190
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,553
There are times when one's duty and one's feelings don't quite align, wouldn't you say?

191
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,591
Sometimes, I wonder...

192
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:53,538
if I put a lid on my feelings the moment I killed him.

193
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,571
A lid?

194
00:12:54,571 --> 00:13:01,555
When both my joy and my sadness reach a certain point, 
the lid makes sure they don't boil over.

195
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:04,541
Even when I try to feel with everything I've got,

196
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,599
it's as though I can only see from outside that lid...

197
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:10,552
with cold eyes.

198
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,548
However...

199
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:22,591
I can feel the lid start to come off while I'm holding a Dominator.

200
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:26,570
When it does, my rationality slams it shut.

201
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,552
Maintaining that composure is what 
allows me to function as an Inspector.

202
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:40,509
Back when I shot Kitazawa, I almost enjoyed it.

203
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,501
I guess that's a bit of a red flag.

204
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,501
All I have now is this job.

205
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,597
I have to hold on to it.

206
00:13:48,597 --> 00:13:51,566
Thanks for the drink. I enjoyed it.

207
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,597
We should've shared one sooner.

208
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:06,508
If I were my old self, I wouldn't be drinking in the first place.

209
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:16,508
Who's this?

210
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:19,509
Inspector Aoyanagi.

211
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:20,555
It's me, Shisui.

212
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:29,582
The investigations of the missing Inspector Shisui from Division 2

213
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:33,531
and the messages you believe were left by a third party.

214
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:38,573
I see. You want me to let Division 1 take the lead on both.

215
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:43,574
Yes. Of course, we won't neglect our usual operations as a result.

216
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,504
Very well. I'll allow it.

217
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:48,557
Thank you very much, Chief.

218
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:50,570
Inspector Shimotsuki, you can go.

219
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:52,573
You only want me to leave?

220
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:56,552
I'd like to speak with Inspector Tsunemori alone.

221
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:59,501
Understood. Please excuse me.

222
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:06,564
Well, then. What do you think of this case?

223
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:08,533
I have a question.

224
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,535
Is there someone out there who Sibyl doesn't recognize?

225
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,503
No such person can exist.

226
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:18,581
But with that question, you've made your thoughts clear to me.

227
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:21,540
Do you doubt my sanity?

228
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,577
That would be the usual judgment.

229
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:26,540
But at the same time, it's intriguing.

230
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,577
Can one lose their sanity when their Psycho-Pass is so clear?

231
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,526
If you just want to sit back and watch, be my guest.

232
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:39,568
One more thing. I have a question about Division 1's personnel.

233
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:45,539
Is the new muscle doing well?

234
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:48,599
You mean Enforcer Tougane and Enforcer Hinakawa?

235
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:51,580
Right. Tougane Sakuya.

236
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,593
I want you to report his status to me as often as possible.

237
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:55,589
Why?

238
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:59,504
Although it's been erased from the official documents,

239
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:04,528
he exhibited the highest Crime Coefficient we've ever had on record.

240
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:08,511
He's useful as a model case.

241
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:10,595
Be careful how you treat him.

242
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:16,557
I know this is asking a lot of each of you.

243
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:20,542
But an Enforcer died, an Inspector has disappeared,

244
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:23,517
and we can't even manage to locate one Dominator.

245
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,563
I hardly believe that we can just leave this case alone.

246
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,504
Tell us what you're really thinking, Tsunemori.

247
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,584
Your true concern is the ghost, right?

248
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,581
Don't let this get personal.

249
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:40,508
I'm going to ask Inspector Karanomori to assist us.

250
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:41,597
Please back me up on this.

251
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,595
This is an elevated Area Stress Level warning!

252
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:51,574
A Psycho-Pass above the regulation value has been detected inside the Daiba Tower Hotel in Minato.

253
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:50,542
I'll go. Kunizuka and Hinakawa, come with me.

254
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,574
Roger.

255
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,574
R-Roger.

256
00:16:51,574 --> 00:17:00,512
Inspector on duty, please bring your Enforcers and make your way to the scene immediately.

257
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:55,544
There's no way Kamui exists.

258
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:58,566
You can go ahead and chase after an imaginary culprit...

259
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:00,512
Inspector.

260
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:05,500
Let's begin our investigation too.

261
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:13,521
I've kept a close eye out, but nothing 
suspicious has turned up at the crime scene.

262
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:16,515
Suppose Kamui does exist.

263
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:20,524
He posed as a hostage to lure out the Bureau

264
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:23,544
and then killed an Enforcer and abducted an Inspector.

265
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,555
But why? What's his goal?

266
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,580
What's the meaning behind the message?

267
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,595
Why did he set his eyes on me?

268
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:33,537
Be careful.

269
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:35,510
You're getting too obsessed with this.

270
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,533
Inspector Tsunemori is fine.

271
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:41,583
It'd take more than this to cloud her Hue.

272
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:53,547
Now is the time for us to put the lessons we've 
learned to good use and carry out a new policy!

273
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:57,533
This is all to improve citizens' lives!

274
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:58,560
In order to do so, we must first...

275
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,503
It was a wonderful speech.

276
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:15,503
Representative Masuda Koutoku.

277
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:20,517
We're from the Public Safety Bureau.

278
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,588
We've detected a lapse in your Hue.

279
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:26,559
Per this diagnosis, you require emergency therapy.

280
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,523
Please come with us.

281
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,580
Th-There must be some mistake!

282
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,559
Restrain him, Hinakawa.

283
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,517
This is how it should be done.

284
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:42,502
What could the Chief see in someone like her?

285
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,552
So Inspector Shisui is here?

286
00:18:47,552 --> 00:18:50,569
Yeah. She told me so herself.

287
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,546
You two stay here.

288
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:58,517
You don't want to make things worse.

289
00:18:58,517 --> 00:18:59,526
Understood.

290
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,513
No! That won't work!

291
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:18,531
Medication can't save anyone.

292
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,546
It changes nothing!

293
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:21,564
But...

294
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:23,584
Everyone needs to open their eyes.

295
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:27,581
They can't just rely on medicine 
if they really want to be saved.

296
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:32,553
I have to save you all.

297
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:33,586
Stop it!

298
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,564
Crime Coefficient is 23.

299
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:38,595
Not a target for enforcement action.

300
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,591
The trigger will be locked.

301
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:42,562
This isn't possible...

302
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:53,530
What the hell?

303
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:57,578
Look.

304
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:58,572
Find something?

305
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:03,543
One of the Drones sent to defuse the bombs where the first message was left

306
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:07,573
was found some distance from the crime scene.

307
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,590
It had already been sent in for maintenance before.

308
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:15,555
The documentation says it was missing a part.

309
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:21,587
Looks like its impact absorber had been removed.

310
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,550
It's hard to think that it just came off by itself.

311
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:27,512
Could it be...

312
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:30,550
Inspector...

313
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,517
Inspector Shimotsuki? What's the matter?

314
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:36,567
Kamui! Call Kamui in here!

315
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:39,509
He can make me clear!

316
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,517
I want to be a savior.

317
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:46,552
I want to save everyone...

318
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,502
Just like Kamui does.

319
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:52,544
All is calm, all is bright

320
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:59,520
A whispering angel falls to Earth

321
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:06,591
Now it eats your body whole

322
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:11,588
It's my fault

323
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:25,542
You open your eyes

324
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,577
and in their grey-blue depth

325
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,520
I see your coldness

326
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,565
Call my name and give me a kiss

327
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:35,528
Embrace me

328
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:42,507
with your empty body

329
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,503
There is still life of sorts

330
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,503
There is still life of sorts

331
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,503
left within you

332
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,503
left within you

333
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,504
left within you

334
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,504
left within you

335
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:49,500
left within you

336
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:50,500
in blood red

337
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:51,500
in blood red

338
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:52,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

339
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:53,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

340
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:54,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

341
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,500
You sing to me of it

342
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:56,500
You sing to me of it

343
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:57,500
What was I born for?

344
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,500
What was I born for?

345
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,501
What was I born for?

346
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:00,501
What was I born for?

347
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:01,501
What was I born for?

348
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:05,555
Love me

349
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,531
Don't let me go

350
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:08,501
Don't let me go

351
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:09,502
Don't let me go
