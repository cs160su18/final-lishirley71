00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,510
Shit!

3
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,310
You fought quite well, considering your wounds.

4
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,670
They must have realized it the moment they set eyes on each other.

5
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,430
That this destiny had awaited them since long before they had even met.

6
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,240
They were not like mere ships passing in the night.

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,400
They understood each other better than anyone else,

8
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,180
and each was focused solely on the other.

9
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,950
You are Kougami Shinya.

10
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,680
You are Makishima Shougo!

00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,870
Excuse me! Are you Inspector Ginoza?

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,000
That's me.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,560
You've got rotten luck, having to deal with an incident right after getting posted.

75
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,760
I'm Tsunemori Akane. I've been assigned to the CID as of today.

76
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,460
Pleased to meet—

77
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,350
Sorry, but the CID is very short on manpower.

78
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,290
So you'll have to hit the ground running.

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,580
Our target is Okura Nobuo.

80
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,750
A street scanner flagged him while doing a Hue Check,

81
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,500
so a Security Drone ordered him to receive therapy,

82
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,970
but he refused and ran.

83
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,450
The Psycho-Pass it recorded for him was forest green.

84
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,430
His aggression and compulsion are expected to be high.

85
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,930
Why would he avoid treatment long enough for his Hue to get this cloudy?

86
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,100
It's also possible that he used incompatible drugs.

87
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,350
In any case, he's a latent criminal; one far enough gone that we don't need to wait for Sibyl Judgement.

88
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,240
The problem is that the place Okura ran to...

89
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,700
is this block.

90
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,050
Since this is an abolition block, there's no relay device, so Drones can't come in.

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,620
In addition...

92
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,920
I heard Okura abducted a passerby and is holding her hostage.

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,460
A hostage?!

94
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,480
According to a witness, it's a young woman.

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,990
We haven't been able to confirm her identity yet.

96
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,750
What about evacuating the residents?

97
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,680
Records state this is an uninhabited block,

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,060
but because of that, it's become a den of homeless people.

99
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,810
Be prepared.

100
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,570
A paddy wagon...

101
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,260
Don't think that the guys you're about to meet are human like us.

102
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,510
Their Psycho-Pass Crime Coefficients all exceed a specific value.

103
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,200
They are people of bankrupt character.

104
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,430
Normally, they would be completely isolated as latent criminals.

105
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,380
However, they're allowed into the outside world for the sole purpose

106
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,570
of flushing out criminals just like themselves.

107
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,390
They're hunting dogs.

108
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,650
They're beasts used to hunt beasts.

109
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,820
They're what we call "Enforcers."

110
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,960
They'll be your subordinates.

111
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,630
Is that cutie the newbie that everyone's been talking about, Gino?

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,480
This is Inspector Tsunemori Akane.

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,850
Starting today, she's your second owner.

114
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,390
P-Pleased to meet you!

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,680
You guys all looked through the target's data, right?

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,780
We're gonna tighten the noose around our cornered rat.

117
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
We'll divide into two groups and take turns.

118
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,750
Kunizuka and Kagari, come with me.

119
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,170
The other two...

120
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,180
will accompany Inspector Tsunemori.

121
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,020
Roger.

122
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,710
What?! I wanna go with the cutie!

123
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,970
Geez, no comeback? He's unbelievable.

124
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,630
It wasn't funny, that's why.

125
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,800
Later!

126
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,140
Well... Um... What should I do?

127
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,800
You could order us to stand by.

128
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,390
We wouldn't have any problems with that.

129
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,250
You oughta earn your paycheck, pops.

130
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,750
Hey, don't look so nervous, young lady.

131
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,050
You know how to use a Dominator, right?

132
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,130
I-I did receive training on it, more or less...

133
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,830
This is a gun that reads the Psycho-Pass of the target you're aiming at.

134
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,880
Its safety is released only when the target is a latent criminal.

135
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,290
You can just do what the Dominator tells you.

136
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,610
If it says shoot, just shoot.

137
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,610
"Just shoot"?

138
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,500
If it's set to basic mode, it'll use Paralyzer.

139
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,570
It'll only paralyze the target, so we'll take them into custody and that'll be that.

140
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,720
Well, you don't have to take it too seriously.

141
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,980
Dominator Portable Psychological Diagnosis and Suppression System

142
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,250
has been activated.

143
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,490
User authentication: Inspector Tsunemori Akane.

144
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,080
Affiliation: Public Safety Bureau,
Criminal Investigation Department.

145
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,240
Dominator usage approval confirmed.

146
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,850
You are a valid user.

147
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,720
Oh, that.

148
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,810
The current enforcement mode is Non-Lethal Paralyzer.

149
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,810
It's a directional voice, so only the holder of the gun can hear it.

150
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,380
Don't worry about it.

151
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,980
Aim calmly and disable the target.

152
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,320
It might be annoying at first, but you'll get used to it soon.

153
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,770
What about a briefing?

154
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,780
Aren't we going to have a meeting and come up with a plan?

155
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,460
We'll hunt the prey and you'll observe.

156
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,040
That's all there is to it.

157
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,540
Um, could you go into a bit more detail?

158
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,810
What he's saying is, leave it to us.

159
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,060
We might not look like it, but we're experts.

160
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,580
We have our own way of doing things.

161
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,100
But the one who's responsible for our actions is you, the Inspector.

162
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,890
So if you have a problem with the way I do things,

163
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,650
use that gun to shoot me.

164
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,570
Wha...

165
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,050
We're latent criminals too, just like the target.

166
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,350
The Dominator will work on us as well.

167
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,590
Oh, we haven't introduced ourselves yet.

168
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,070
That stubborn fool is Kougami Shinya.

169
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,140
And I'm Masaoka Tomomi.

170
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,820
Looking forward to working with you, young lady.

171
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,800
Y-Yes...

172
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,790
Well then, shall we go?

173
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,330
Up until today, I did everything by the book.

174
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,990
I spent my whole life walking on eggshells,

175
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,400
trying my hardest not to upset or bother anyone.

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,500
And yet, I get flagged by one little detector and boom!

177
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,250
They already treat me like I'm a criminal.

178
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,150
This is it for me. Now that it's come to this, it's all over.

179
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,060
I'll never be able to get a job, get married, or anything else.

180
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,490
Well, fine then.

181
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,130
I've restrained myself all this time.

182
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,580
So now, I'll just do whatever I want. I'll take whatever I want.

183
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,780
I'll kill anyone I don't like!

184
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,090
P-Please don't.

185
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,300
I've always wanted...

186
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,920
to have sex with a pretty woman like you.

187
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,020
With a real, flesh-and-blood woman, not a virtual one.

188
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,410
Kantou Chinese Restaurant

189
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,960
I wonder where Kougami went.

190
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,270
Crime Coefficient is under by 60.

191
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,370
Not a target for enforcement action.

192
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,840
The trigger will be locked.

193
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,610
Crime Coefficient is over by 120.

194
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,860
An Enforcer registered at the Criminal Investigation Department.

195
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,530
This target has Enforce At Will status.

196
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,000
The safety will be released.

197
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,840
So he really is a latent criminal...

198
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,640
And yet, he seemed pretty normal.

199
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,350
I've heard rumors about you.

200
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,600
They say you were the top student at the academy.

201
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,230
Well, kinda...

202
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,210
I'll give you some friendly advice.

203
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,320
Just forget everything you learned there.

204
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,280
None of that stuff is any use when you're actually working on a case.

205
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,670
Sounds irrational, right?

206
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,790
Get used to it. Our work's full of things that defy all logic.

207
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,030
People's thoughts, wishes, hopes and desires...

208
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,930
We live in a time where technology can read everything in your mind,

209
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,050
and yet, the world teems with people who hate, lie, steal, and try to harm others.

210
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,010
If that's not irrational, then what is it?

211
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,690
Everything you've been taught is based on theories and logic.

212
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,940
Soon, you'll likely come to realize how pointless they are.

213
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,570
Well, at least be prepared.

214
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,360
I...

215
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,370
This is Hound 4.

216
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,030
I found the target on the fourth floor of the KT Building. What are your orders?

217
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,720
Stay there and keep an eye on him.

218
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,500
Hound 2 and I will box him in.

219
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,420
Okay.

220
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,080
But considering how worked up he is,

221
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,260
the girl he took as a hostage may be at the end of her rope.

222
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,640
Should I go in by myself and secure him?

223
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,250
Okay. Don't mess it up.

224
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,970
Roger.

225
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,180
Crime Coefficient is over by 190.

226
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,430
He's a target for enforcement action.

227
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,400
The safety will be released.

228
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,400
My, my... What a bad boy.

229
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,760
Kagari! What are you doing?

230
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,440
The Paralyzer isn't working!

231
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,210
He's on stimulants or something!

232
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,670
The target's Threat Judgement has been updated.

233
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,050
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,890
Shit!

235
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,240
Well I'll be.

236
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,020
Th-This is...

237
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,500
An Oracle by the Sibyl System.

238
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,840
It says that Okura Nobuo is no longer someone who's needed in this world.

239
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,500
Oh no... All this because he was detected by a street scanner?

240
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,700
He probably drove himself into a corner.

241
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,420
Nothing, not even therapy, will work on him anymore.

242
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,380
The judgment on him is that there's no room for rehabilitation.

243
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,850
It's unfortunate that your first case had to be such an unpleasant one, young lady.

244
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:25,270
My Psycho-Pass has become so cloudy that it looks like mud.

245
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,240
What's more, your Psycho-Pass looks just like mine now.

246
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,620
You and I are alike.

247
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,890
If they catch you, it'll be all over for you too.

248
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,120
You'll be tortured by them as a latent criminal for the rest of your life.

249
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,380
We'd better resolve this quickly or it'll be all over for the hostage.

250
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,760
It's a Psycho-Hazard, right?

251
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,900
Yeah. A Crime Coefficient can be contagious.

252
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,420
Young people these days aren't good at dealing with stress,

253
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,290
so they're easily affected by violent urges and compulsions.

254
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,690
I wrote a thesis on that topic.

255
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,820
Let me tell you one thing, young lady. It could happen to any of us.

256
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:15,740
The reason we were made Enforcers in the first place is...

257
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,070
Stop right there!

258
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,460
Stay back!

259
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,610
Drop your guns!

260
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,810
Step back!

261
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,320
Die!

262
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,950
Wh-What the hell is this?!

263
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,750
My deepest sympathies.

264
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,220
This is Hound 3. Enforcement completed.

265
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,880
Using an old man and a newbie as a decoy, eh?

266
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,290
You sure got cojones, don't you, Ko?

267
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,300
Just earning my paycheck, pops.

268
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,480
We're with the Public Safety Bureau.

269
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,890
You're safe now. Please rest at ease.

270
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,600
Calm down!

271
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,500
We came to rescue you!

272
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,200
No... No...

273
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,250
Don't...

274
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,970
Please don't...

275
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,570
Masaoka...

276
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,180
Young lady...

277
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,450
check her with your gun.

278
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,100
Crime Coefficient is over by 160.

279
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,170
She's a target for enforcement action.

280
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,560
Well, I guess we have no choice.

281
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,520
Stop it!

282
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,280
No! Nooooo!

283
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,770
The hell's wrong with you?!

284
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,660
We should be protecting her!

285
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,780
That's exactly why the Paralyzer exists!

286
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,280
We'll put her to sleep right away and take her into custody!

287
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,290
She's just confused!

288
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,250
You don't have to use violence on her!

289
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,640
Listen. The Dominators are Sibyl's eyes.

290
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,210
This town's system itself has decided that she's a threat!

291
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,090
Think about what that means!

292
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,570
So you'd shoot a victim who hasn't even committed a crime yet?!

293
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,590
I can't accept that!

294
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,910
Stay away... Don't come any closer.

295
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,920
Stop it already...

296
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,250
I-I said stay away!

297
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,630
Kougami!

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,440
Please don't.

299
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,570
Please!

300
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,900
She's the victim here!

301
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,070
Target's Threat Judgement has been updated.

302
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,020
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

303
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,550
Aim carefully and eliminate the target.

304
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,580
No...

305
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,050
Don't!

306
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,250
Please stop.

307
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,400
Throw that lighter away.

308
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,610
Or... this gun will kill you.

309
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,170
Please! I want to help you!

310
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,160
So throw that lighter away.

311
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,920
Target's Threat Judgement has been updated.

312
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,240
Enforcement mode is Non-Lethal Paralyzer.

313
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,520
Aim calmly and bring the target under control.

314
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,200
Inspector Tsunemori.

315
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,010
I'll expect you to thoroughly explain your handling of this situation in your report.

316
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,310
This newbie we got sure is a piece of work.

317
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,850
This is a world where the mental state and personal tendencies of humans can be quantified.
While all sorts of inclinations are recorded and policed, these measured numbers used to judge people's souls are commonly called "Psycho-Pass".

318
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,850
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all individuals and organizations that appear
in this show are fictitious and any similarity to those in existence in the real world is purely coincidental.
