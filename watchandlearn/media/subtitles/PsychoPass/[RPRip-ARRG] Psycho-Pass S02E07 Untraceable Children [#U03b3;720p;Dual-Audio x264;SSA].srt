1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,595
This case isn't even over yet,

2
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:13,537
and we're already relying on Drones.

3
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,556
This is awesome!

4
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:38,589
Realistic games are way better.

5
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,585
Freeze! CID!

6
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,556
Hinakawa!

7
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:48,500
Crime Coefficient is 133.

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,572
A target for enforcement action.

9
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,520
I'm enforcing justice!

10
00:00:56,572 --> 00:01:01,529
The next Area Stress warning has been issued in a commercial area eight kilometers away.

11
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,579
Give me a break! It never ends!

12
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,576
In a society under constant surveillance by scanners, you can't pass yourself off as another person.

13
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,517
But that's not necessarily the case if one can take measures to keep his Psycho-Pass clear.

14
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,592
Through organ transplantation, for example.

15
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:23,540
Transplanting a lot of one's organs is like transplanting one's Psycho-Pass.

16
00:01:23,596 --> 00:01:28,586
If the Hue is clear, any discrepancy is likely to fall within the margin of error.

17
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:34,507
I've heard that quite a few organs were stored in Kamui's hideout.

18
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:36,578
Representative Masuda, I'm here to pick you up.

19
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:45,585
There are other impostors out there just like you.

20
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,563
Are they Kamui's accomplices?

21
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,551
Inspector.

22
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:59,543
Once again, I couldn't shoot.

23
00:01:59,543 --> 00:02:03,544
If it hadn't been for you, we'd all be dead.

24
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:07,565
What matters is that we were able to see the ghost with our own eyes.

25
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:13,503
If anyone's going to arrest Kamui, it'll be you after all.

26
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,503

27
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:36,071
I will go insane

28
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:34,505
if the world keeps ruining my life

29
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:38,555
I've stopped breathing

30
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:41,514
from the nervousness every day

31
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:43,506
Enigmatic feeling

32
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,598
I have to be the aggressor

33
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,565
The world has stopped making sense

34
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,553
It's dissolving

35
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,566
God has come to us

36
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:01,508
with sword in hand

37
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:05,591
The world has split in two

38
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,571
Half is mad,

39
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:09,571
and so am I

40
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,538
Where's the difference?

41
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:12,596
Where's the difference?

42
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:16,522
Only God can walk the borderline

43
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:19,589
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

44
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:23,543
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

45
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:26,556
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,585
I have no focus in my soul

47
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:33,548
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

48
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:36,553
I can't even look into the mirror

49
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,500
untraceable children

50
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,500
untraceable children

51
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,500
untraceable children

52
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,500
untraceable children

53
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:51,500
untraceable children

54
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:51,500
untraceable children

55
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,576
He tested an unauthorized user's ability to wield a Dominator.

56
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:52,500
untraceable children

57
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:52,500
untraceable children

58
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,551
That was the first case.

59
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,589
He then experimented with a Dominator's capacity to judge Inspectors.

60
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:04,577
That was the second one.

61
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:14,582
This time, he attacked the Bureau and obtained multiple Dominators, presumably to distribute to his accomplices.

62
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:19,541
In other words, his goal isn't something he can achieve on his own.

63
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:24,516
Who on earth are you trying to point those Dominators at?

64
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:29,517
And Dominators can't even recognize you, 
much less judge you.

65
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:30,553
But why?

66
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:35,551
When the impossible happens, 
there are only two possibilities.

67
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:41,540
Either your assumptions are wrong, 
or you have gone insane.

68
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,562
It'd make more sense if I were imagining all this, 
but that's not the case.

69
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:48,598
Kamui exists. That's an indisputable fact.

70
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,522
And yet Dominators don't even recognize him.

71
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:53,594
He's not just another Makishima.

72
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:59,590
He's unique, not criminally asymptomatic. 
There's something else that makes him invisible in this society.

73
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,544
He knows how to fool the system—

74
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:08,558
to exploit a weakness in this society of total control over the individual.

75
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:10,558
The...

76
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:13,504
The answer may be...

77
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,542
...closer than we think.

78
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,513
Something wrong?

79
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:23,538
Oh, sorry. I spaced out a bit.

80
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:24,535
What were you saying?

81
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:25,580
I was talking about Kamui.

82
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,598
I think that determining his bodily constitution, which isn't perceived by cymatic scans,

83
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:32,581
is the best way to solve this whole thing.

84
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:36,527
I agree. If we figure out why he isn't recognized,

85
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,573
we may be able to decipher his color.

86
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,599
How can Kamui persist as a ghost?

87
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:44,595
Let's examine the scene for clues.

88
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,529
What color... are you?

89
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:57,596
Transplant organs weren't all that Kamui was storing in his hideout.

90
00:05:57,596 --> 00:06:02,519
It seems they've found bio-contact lenses with a traced retinal pattern there, too.

91
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:05,562
The retinal pattern must belong to Shisui Mizue.

92
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:07,593
Very perceptive. I'm impressed.

93
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:15,540
The only way an unauthorized user can wield a Dominator is to have it falsely recognize them as authorized.

94
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,534
Kamui probably considers Shisui 
a pawn that can facilitate that, so...

95
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:23,558
So that's why we detected 
more than one Inspector Shisui.

96
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:26,542
Eight Dominators have been taken so far.

97
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:31,500
Therefore, we can assume that up to eight Shisui Mizues may be detected.

98
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,562
You don't sound very fazed.

99
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:36,528
Am I to assume you've already 
come up with a way to stop them?

100
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:37,575
Nope, I've got nothing.

101
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:43,576
Those Dominators will be put to use as long as Sibyl continues to recognize her actions as valid.

102
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:46,566
Oh, my. Is that a knock on Sibyl?

103
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:47,572
It's suspicion.

104
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,531
That's even worse.

105
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:56,515
Doppelgängers are roaming free without a care, and an Inspector aiding a criminal is at large.

106
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:59,527
I'm just stating the facts.

107
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:03,524
Well, then. Both of you should head back.

108
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,570
I'm going to stay behind for a bit and go through Kamui's hideout.

109
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,582
You should get some rest, Tsunemori.

110
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:12,516
I agree.

111
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:16,525
It's kind of hard to get any rest at my apartment,

112
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:18,596
since I've been leaving the crime scene untouched.

113
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:20,536
Wait a second!

114
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:23,514
You haven't moved?! What are you thinking?!

115
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:26,513
Are you trying to use yourself as bait?

116
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:30,518
I'm not that reckless.

117
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,560
I just haven't had the time.

118
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:34,549
You're unbelievable.

119
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,563
Grandma's...

120
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:49,578
There was a malfunction with the nursing Drones at the nursing home fostering Tsunemori Aoi's protective custody.

121
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:54,550
Grandma!

122
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:59,506
What's the matter? You look pale.

123
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:00,513
Grandma...

124
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,513
It's been a while, Akane.

125
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:06,559
Tsunemori Aoi

126
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:06,559
I'm so glad you're okay.

127
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,528
You're overreacting.

128
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:11,560
You didn't have to neglect your work and rush here over such a trifling matter.

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,593
Well, I wouldn't say I'm neglecting it.

130
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,518
You haven't changed a bit.

131
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:21,586
You relentlessly focus on the needs of others without even considering your own.

132
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,536
I'm sorry for always causing you trouble.

133
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:29,586
Don't be silly. I never think you cause me trouble.

134
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:33,587
You appreciate the value of human life.

135
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:39,571
You must always hold on to that, okay?

136
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:41,583
Grandma...

137
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,513
Thank you.

138
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:50,572
I've already been briefed on the case.

139
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:54,526
I came here today to hear Sibyl's thoughts.

140
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:59,546
Why haven't you deactivated the Dominators that Inspector Shisui is using?

141
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,542
I'm sure you've been keeping tabs on all of her actions.

142
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,548
Of course we have.

143
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:09,541
But Inspector Shisui's Psycho-Pass is still clear.

144
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:16,562
There's no reason for us to prevent an Inspector with a clear Psycho-Pass from taking action.

145
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:21,548
You mean you can't, because doing so 
would be admitting the system is flawed.

146
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:24,534
Watch your mouth, Inspector Tsunemori.

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,505
We can't bring this culprit to justice 
while being bound by the current rules.

148
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:30,580
You're talking about Kamui?

149
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:33,548
I've read your report.

150
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:37,501
You said the Dominators didn't even recognize him.

151
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:38,534
Yes.

152
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,548
That's not possible.

153
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:47,500
It'd one thing if he were criminally asymptomatic, but no irregularity can allow a person to bypass scans entirely.

154
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,557
But the reality is that this impossible irregularity has appeared.

155
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:54,508
How are we supposed to deal with someone like that?

156
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:58,566
It's simple. You tried to do it yourself, didn't you?

157
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:04,504
Are you suggesting that murder is appropriate?

158
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:08,532
Was stopping Enforcer Tougane really the right decision?

159
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,576
It's strange.

160
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:18,564
The Sibyl System has maintained itself by taking in irregular, criminally asymptomatic people.

161
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:24,539
But when it comes to Kamui, you'd rather remove the irregularity from society without even bothering to study it.

162
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:28,557
In other words, you've already come to your conclusion.

163
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:34,508
Kamui is the kind of outlier whom you cannot take in.

164
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,564
You're as interesting as ever.

165
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:39,554
Let's say your theory is correct. What's your next step?

166
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:46,596
I'll solve the mystery behind Kamui, arrest him, 
and make sure he faces rightful justice.

167
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,586
Any problem with that?

168
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:52,555
No. Continue to fulfill your duty to the best of your ability.

169
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:53,588
Excuse me.

170
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,541
You tried to cover your tracks,

171
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:26,508
but things are out of order and out of alignment.

172
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,579
You're not very thorough, are you?

173
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:33,546
Looks like whoever it was copied some data.

174
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,542
My background, huh?

175
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,538
I see.

176
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:48,577
You must really have it in for me, Inspector Shimotsuki.

177
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:53,519
An old personnel file?

178
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,536
He was previously assigned as an Enforcer eighteen years ago at age 23.

179
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:02,587
All the Inspectors he worked with became latent criminals and were executed with Eliminators.

180
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,533
This data wasn't made available to us.

181
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,529
What's with this guy?

182
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:17,588
All right. Is everyone here?

183
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,581
Yeah. I was told that Enforcer Sugou won't be making it back for a while.

184
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:29,594
Then let's begin.

185
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:34,597
The question right now is how to pursue Kamui after losing him at the port.

186
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:39,515
We searched for Representative Masuda Koutoku, 
thinking that he might report to Kamui,

187
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:42,568
but it looks like he died soon after his release.

188
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,564
He chose to die without a second thought.

189
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:49,504
That's how much he admired Kamui.

190
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:53,548
We knew he wasn't the real Masuda, and yet our hands were still tied.

191
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:55,513
We won't let Kamui have his way anymore.

192
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:58,559
First, let's talk about the evidence left at the scene.

193
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:03,553
What really stood out were the large number of organs

194
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:06,502
and the stockpile of stress-care medicine.

195
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,548
Th-This is amazing.

196
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,575
What is it, Hinakawa?

197
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:16,513
Th-These drugs are a product of clandestine chemistry.

198
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:18,568
I've never seen cocktails like them.

199
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:22,533
Plus, they should be impossible 
to adjust at this level of detail.

200
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,591
I don't understand.

201
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:30,580
Even I can do some basic, straightforward compounding, 
if that's what you're looking for.

202
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,582
But if these were his target results, 
his knowledge must be far beyond average.

203
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:38,586
So he has an extraordinary knowledge of drugs?

204
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:40,526
Y-Yes.

205
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:45,522
Maybe using a Holo to disguise himself as a pharmacist wasn't just a feint.

206
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:48,540
Kamui disguised himself as a pharmacist?

207
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,533
U-Uh, yes.

208
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,573
I discovered it during the barricade incident.

209
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:57,515
I only noticed it after looking very closely.

210
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:01,507
I-It was well made, but it was definitely a Holo.

211
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:07,537
Why didn't you report it?

212
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:12,552
I... I sent the data to Inspector Shimotsuki.

213
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:16,560
I have a log of the transmission.

214
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,500
Why didn't you report it verbally?!

215
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,597
You didn't notify me properly!

216
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,591
Operational improvement can wait.

217
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:27,564
Hinakawa, send the data to the Analysis Lab.

218
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,560
You know, I wonder if this one is the same as...

219
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:34,571
Look. I knew it.

220
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:40,564
This Holo is an approximated model of a younger person. 
I just cross-referenced it with the victims in that plane crash.

221
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:41,586
There's a perfect match.

222
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:44,520
The plane accident fifteen years ago.

223
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,595
Just like the female Holo Kamui used in the first incident.

224
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:52,555
Our assumptions were wrong.

225
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:55,517
It's not the first woman whom we should be focusing on.

226
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:58,563
It's all the children who died in this accident.

227
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:01,595
Can you pull up some more details on it, Karanomori?

228
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:02,584
Sure.

229
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:03,501
NIKKU AIRLINES FLIGHT 321 CRASHES!

230
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:03,501
Status of the 205 passengers 
and crew is currently unknown

231
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,509
NIKKU AIRLINES FLIGHT 321 CRASHES!

232
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,509
Status of the 205 passengers 
and crew is currently unknown

233
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,571
The crash happened fifteen years ago in May.

234
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:11,535
A plane carrying elementary-school students on a class trip crashed into Mt. Kumataka.

235
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:11,535
NIKKU AIRLINES FLIGHT 321 CRASHES!

236
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:11,535
NIKKU AIRLINES FLIGHT CRASHES WITH 205 ON BOARD

237
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:11,535
School Trip Tragedy: Nikku Plane Crashes

238
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,580
It says the cause was a problem with the airframe.

239
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,586
There was a total of 202 people on board.

240
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:20,575
Victims included 185 children along with chaperones, crew members, and pilots.

241
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,503
Wait!

242
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:24,599
There was one survivor.

243
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,550
This name...

244
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:30,539
Kamui Kirito.

245
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:36,583
He was the sole survivor.

246
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:39,533
It's no use.

247
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:45,505
Even the Bureau's clearance doesn't seem to be high enough to access records on Kamui Kirito.

248
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:49,540
It's citing medical confidentiality as the reason.

249
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,543
Let's check into the people involved with his surgery.

250
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:55,514
The one who would appear to be the most informed is...

251
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:58,510
Oh, his operating surgeon is still practicing.

252
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,520
I'll go see him immediately.

253
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,588
Inspector Shimotsuki, please come with me.

254
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:02,586
Roger.

255
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:05,507
Thank you, Hinakawa.

256
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:08,568
We couldn't have found him without you.

257
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,517
S-Sure...

258
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:14,571
I want you to work on approximating models of the 185 children

259
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,513
who were victims in the accident.

260
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:18,550
A-All of them?!

261
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:21,526
You expect one person to do all that?

262
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:24,534
We might be able to identify a third or even a fourth Holo.

263
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,542
Can you do it, Hinakawa?

264
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,564
I... I can, Akane.

265
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:35,571
Kunizuka, please look for anyone who has the same name as one of the victims.

266
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:36,560
Okay.

267
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,581
Ginoza and Tougane, I want you to use the organs we seized to identify any potential impostors out there.

268
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:42,577
Got it.

269
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,501
Understood.

270
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,566
I finished all the necessary preparations.

271
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,579
Once you receive them, all of you will be able to use the Dominators.

272
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,517
Thank you.

273
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:04,570
All I have to do now is find the one who makes this society what it is.

274
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:07,528
The Bureau people are here.

275
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,528
They say they want to talk to you, Dr. Masuzaki.

276
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:11,518
Show them in.

277
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:12,508
Right away.

278
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:13,586
Looks like they're here.

279
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,540
I really appreciate your help.

280
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,539
I should be the one thanking you.

281
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:23,568
I wish you all the best in your plan, Kirito.

282
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,532
You're Dr. Masuzaki Youhei, right?

283
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:32,524
Could I ask you to come with us voluntarily?

284
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:35,570
I'm rather a poor talker.

285
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,566
I'm worried that I won't be able to properly convey Kamui's gospel.

286
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:49,520
Inspector Shimotsuki, I want you to look into Kamui's medical records as soon as we get back.

287
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,517
Is that necessary?

288
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,539
We have a witness. All we need in order to get answers now is an interrogation.

289
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,521
If Kamui helps him maintain a clear Psycho-Pass as well,

290
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:01,535
we can't assume he'll be honest.

291
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:03,541
We need to corroborate his story.

292
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,503
Kunizuka, there's something I want you to...

293
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:17,562
help me with...

294
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:24,504
I guess you'll do. Give me a hand.

295
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:32,517
He suffered serious depression and became dependent on medication.

296
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:33,577
Poor thing.

297
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:40,520
He improved his skills to use as a defense mechanism, which helped him become a Holo designer.

298
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,500
How cute. That's just like him.

299
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,506
If that were the whole story, he wouldn't have been disposed to become an Enforcer.

300
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:54,595
The authorization level for the surgery records is quite high.

301
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:56,515
Why?

302
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,541
How should I know? I'll leave the rest to you.

303
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:02,588
One possibility is that it involved patents for drugs or technology.

304
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:04,519
Drug patents...

305
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:10,590
If I'm not mistaken, one of the leading organizations in drug patents in Japan is...

306
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:13,575
The Tougane Foundation.

307
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,572
On second thought, I'll handle this.

308
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:22,593
Keep working on the Holos as per Inspector Tsunemori's orders.

309
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,564
G-Got it.

310
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:31,528
Can I ask you to interrogate him, Professor?

311
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,513
I don't think there'll be much need for interrogation this time around.

312
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:38,517
He's planning to tell us everything. Right?

313
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:42,511
I won't talk to just anyone.

314
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:47,539
But fortunately, it seems that you're wise and trustworthy.

315
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:49,500
Thanks.

316
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:53,517
I'll tell you about Kamui.

317
00:19:55,513 --> 00:20:01,560
Shou just informed me via email that he finished with the 185 aged-up Holos.

318
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,590
He's...

319
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,545
That guy is...

320
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,587
the programmer at the Military Drone facility.

321
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,531
I remember seeing some others, too.

322
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:28,546
I think this guy was in charge of vehicle maintenance.

323
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,567
You probably think that one man, Kamui, has been making fools of you.

324
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:39,584
But that's wrong. He was never alone at all.

325
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:43,568
Forget the third or the fourth Holo.

326
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:46,538
Kamui...

327
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,572
has been right beside us this whole time.

328
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:52,556
All is calm, all is bright

329
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:59,532
A whispering angel falls to Earth

330
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:07,503
Now it eats your body whole

331
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:12,500
It's my fault

332
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:25,555
You open your eyes

333
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:27,589
and in their grey-blue depth

334
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:30,531
I see your coldness

335
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:32,577
Call my name and give me a kiss

336
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:35,540
Embrace me

337
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:42,519
with your empty body

338
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,503
There is still life of sorts

339
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,503
There is still life of sorts

340
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,503
left within you

341
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,503
left within you

342
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,503
left within you

343
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,503
left within you

344
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,503
left within you

345
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,504
in blood red

346
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,504
in blood red

347
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:52,500
in blood red

348
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

349
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:54,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

350
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,500
You sing to me of it

351
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:56,500
You sing to me of it

352
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:57,500
What was I born for?

353
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,500
What was I born for?

354
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,500
What was I born for?

355
00:21:59,596 --> 00:22:00,500
What was I born for?

356
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:01,500
What was I born for?

357
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:05,568
Love me

358
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:07,543
Don't let me go

359
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:08,501
Don't let me go

360
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:09,501
Don't let me go

361

This is a world where the mental state and personal tendencies of humans can be quantified. 
While all sorts of inclinations are recorded and policed, these measured numbers used to judge people's souls are commonly called "Psycho-Pass".
