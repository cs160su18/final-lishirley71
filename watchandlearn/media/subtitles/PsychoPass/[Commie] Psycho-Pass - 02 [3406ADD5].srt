00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,090
Good morning!

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,510
It's 8:15 on November 5th!

4
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,390
Tsunemori Akane, your Psycho-Pass Hue is powder blue this morning!

5
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,230
Have a wonderful day with that healthy mind of yours!

6
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,910
Oh man, I messed up...

7
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,460
My head is full of things

8
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,630
that I can never tell anybody of

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,180
In this perfect world

10
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,140
I roam, a lost being

11
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,030
The impossible is holding sway over me

12
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,990
All I know of the world is what I can see

13
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,070
Is that enough to find its faults?

14
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,200
Artificial, artificial

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,370
Hey, how can they stay so sane?

16
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,410
This is their artificial world

17
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,210
In this beautiful world

18
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,550
there is something

19
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,050
that obscures all light for me

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,430
My heart tries to make sense of it

21
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,810
and finds no answer

22
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,930
Secret kills for you

23
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,640
Secret kills for you

24
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,190
Secret image for you

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,570
Don't show me a dark future

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,910
with this gaudy land

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,540
Show me a way to fade

28
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,050
I'm not on the day shift today... right?

29
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,760
You're meeting up with Funahara Yuki and Minase Kaori at Akebonobashi Station at 11:00.

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,140
At 14:30, you start second shift duty at the Public Safety Bureau.

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,640
Oh, that's right.

32
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,230
What's your room preference today?

33
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,520
Victor Horta's Hotel Tassel.

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,530
Okay! I'll use the library as reference!

35
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,280
#02: Those Capable

36
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,790
Your dietary intake yesterday was 2200 kilocalories in total.

37
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,840
The recommended amount for today's breakfast is 240 kilocalories.

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,590
I'll have a 200 kilocalorie Chinese-flavored breakfast.

39
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,600
Certainly!

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,310
It was my very first day on the job...

41
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,150
Why me? What'd I do?

42
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,500
Today's weather will be morning clouds giving way to sunny skies.

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,250
There is a 0% chance of precipitation.

44
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,050
The anticipated group stress in the Shinjuku ward is Level 3.

45
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,760
I recommend taking a supplement to prevent mental contamination.

46
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,700
I guess this'll do.

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,660
All right, see you later.

48
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,330
Take care!

49
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,760
So...

50
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,260
You messed up, huh?

51
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,010
Yeah... though I can't give you the details

52
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,770
since I work for the Public Safety Bureau and all.

53
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,480
I don't know much about these things,

54
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,900
but what you did wasn't in violation of your duties, right?

55
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,730
I guess not.

56
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,610
Then you don't have to worry about it, right?

57
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,240
Besides, your Psycho-Pass isn't that clouded either.

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,120
I guess that means you're not that bothered by it after all?

59
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,910
C'mon, don't be mean!

60
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,250
I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.

61
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,500
I'm surprised the Hue Check showed such a clear color for you, considering what you went through.

62
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,210
You don't give yourself much psychological care,

63
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,800
and yet you're such a mental beauty.

64
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,340
How do you stay so healthy?

65
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,800
Well... Maybe I'm just thick-skinned, you know?

66
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,930
God really is unfair.

67
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,020
You said it.

68
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,770
I-In any case... It's not that I doubt the Sibyl System,

69
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,240
but I wonder if a career at the Public Safety Bureau is really right for me.

70
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,990
Jeez, you're lucky to even have the choice!

71
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,490
I know you like to speak without thinking, but that's pushing it even for you!

72
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,120
To start with, you were found to have an aptitude for jobs

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,540
at the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Technology,

74
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,840
and yet you rejected them both and picked the Public Safety Bureau, right?

75
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,840
The best I could do was C-rank scores across the board.

76
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,180
What's the problem? You're good at blue-collar work.

77
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,260
I'm a systems engineer, so my shoulders are always killing me.

78
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,230
Akane, you were an honor student who scored 700 points on the last exam.

79
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,440
You should be able to take on any job with ease, right?

80
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,570
Sorry. I guess we went a little too far.

81
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,870
But I think that if anyone can pull off that job, it's you.

82
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,790
And not just because of the aptitude the System indicated.

83
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,380
As a friend, I know you'll do well.

84
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,300
"That which needs to be done is carried out by those capable of doing it.

85
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,050
Such is the grace bestowed upon mankind by Sibyl."

86
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,260
Just kidding.

87
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,950
Excuse me!

88
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,490
Is Analyst Karanomori Shion here?

89
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,500
Yeah, yeah. Who are you?

90
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,630
I'm Tsunemori Akane. I've been assigned to the CID as of yesterday.

91
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,630
Oh! You're the new Inspector who shot Shinya, aren't you?

92
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,430
Wow... You're a lot cuter than I thought.

93
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,770
That cute face of yours hides how daring you can be, though!

94
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,230
What happened? Did Shinya grab your butt or something?

95
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,940
No. Um...

96
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,650
I was told I should come to you to find out how he's doing.

97
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,360
Oh, that.

98
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,990
While I do have a physician's license,

99
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,750
can you believe that's all it took for the government to delegate employee health care to the Analysis Lab?

100
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,120
Sure, I may be a latent criminal too,

101
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,340
but that doesn't mean they can just slave drive me as much as they want, right?

102
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,300
R-Right...

103
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,670
Let's see. Akane, was it?

104
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,930
If you're an Inspector, that puts you on the fast track at the Bureau, right?

105
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,140
Hurry up and become a high-ranking official so you can reform the system.

106
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,650
You can start by splashing out for a swimming pool and bar lounge at the CID.

107
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,810
I'm counting on you!

108
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,360
Right, well.. How's Kougami's treatment going?

109
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,450
Oh, that's right.

110
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,290
Well, you scored a direct hit on his spinal cord,

111
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,170
so he's still out of commission.

112
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:32,250
It'll be a little longer before he's able to stand, talk, or anything like that.

113
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,390
Of course, you wouldn't be able to join him in bed right now, either.

114
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,180
If you just want to peek in on him, that'd be okay.

115
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,020
What do you wanna do?

116
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,350
W-Well, I'd better not bother him.

117
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,980
If he spends today resting, the aftereffects should go away.

118
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,610
Come back tomorrow morning.

119
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,610
Okay.

Hmm?

147
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,700
Excuse me, are there any other tablets?

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,830
...undergoing treatment after taking a Paralyzer on the chin? Yep!

151
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,370
Ow!

152
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,040
That hurt...

153
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,960
Here.

154
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,880

155
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,180
O-Okay.

156
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,140
Sorry for getting in late.

157
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,100
Oh? You're on duty tonight, young lady?

158
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,600
Ah, yes.

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,640
It must be tough after what happened yesterday.

160
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,610
Well, let's hope that today's a little quieter—

A Psycho-Pass above the regulation value has been detected

163
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,740
inside Iko Gryce Hill in the Adachi ward.

164
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,500
Inspector on duty, please accompany the Enforcers to the site immediately.

165
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,790
And just when I was hoping today would be quiet...

166
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,540
Well, our shift just ended, so... good luck.

167
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,340
Would you like me to cover for Kougami?

168
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,130
No, that won't be necessary.

169
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,260
Let's get going, Ms. Inspector.

170
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,600
What?!

171
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,530
Drones have been watching the entrances to the mall since the warning was triggered.

172
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,700
They haven't caught anyone yet.

173
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,540
In other words, whoever's elevating the Area Stress level is still in the mall.

174
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,540
Are we going to use Dominators?

175
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,460
We'll have them delivered to us as a precaution.

176
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,800
but we probably won't need them.

177
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,260
Well then, shall we go?

178
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,730
Do you feel uncomfortable?

179
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,320
I thought your generation was used to playing with holo-suits on.

180
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,280
It feels a bit weird with my whole body as an Avatar.

181
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,530
It's okay, so let me see.

182
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,200
Oh, stop it.

183
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,240
Not a chance!

184
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,460
Oh, there's our man.

185
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,380
On the right, hiding behind the front column.

186
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,970
But... How can you tell without even using a scanner?

187
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,800
A beast can sniff out another beast's scent.

188
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,480
Excuse me. Could we please measure your Psycho-Pass?

189
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,300
Whoa... It's looking pretty cloudy.

190
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,170
My assessment is that you require emergency therapy.

191
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,300
Please come with me.

192
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,430
What? Why?

193
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,890
I haven't done anything yet...

194
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,390
So you really can identify latent criminals?

195
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,400
With experience, you'll intuitively know at first glance when someone's up to no good.

196
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,980
Committing crimes, or cracking down on them...

197
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,910
Either way, they're talents that deal with criminal behavior.

198
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,410
That's why my Crime Coefficient is so high.

199
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,750
Thanks to that, I'm now treated like a hunting dog who gets all the dirty work.

200
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,630
In the end...

201
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,340
I was pretty useless in there, wasn't I?

202
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,420
No, you were quite helpful.

203
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,300
Enforcers can't walk around outside without an accompanying Inspector.

204
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,600
But that's...

205
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,180
We talked about this, right?

206
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,440
After you bring Enforcers to the site,

207
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,190
all you need to do is keep an eye on them to make sure they don't slack off,

208
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,360
That's all you need to do.

209
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,990
In other words, you're telling me not to do anything, right?

210
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,550
Can I join you, Ms. Inspector?

211
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:08,920
Sure.

212
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,810
I thought you were already off duty today.

213
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,940
We Enforcers are prisoners, you know.

214
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,780
Even when we're off duty, there's nowhere else we can go besides the CID floor and our quarters.

215
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,820
Well, sorry about earlier.

216
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,830
I got kinda carried away.

217
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,540
As you can see, all the other women

218
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,540
who work here are scary as hell, so...

219
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,540
I'm just glad that a cute girl like you joined the CID, Akane.

220
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,750
Oh, can I call you Akane?

221
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,550
Yeah, sure.

222
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,890
But hell, an Inspector with the Public Safety Bureau? Crazy place to work, right?

223
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,850
Why here?

224
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,270
Do you think I'm not suited for it?

225
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,520
After what happened yesterday, anyone would probably think that way.

226
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,900
Sibyl's Judgment of my job aptitude

227
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,450
exceeded the Bureau's employment standards, so here I am.

228
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,450
That's the thing I don't get.

229
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,870
If you passed the Bureau's standards,

230
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,710
you must've gotten a good ranking for other places too, right?

231
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,000
Couldn't you have picked a different job?

232
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,710
Yeah.

233
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,550
I got an A ranking for all thirteen ministries and agencies, not to mention six companies.

234
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,180
What?

235
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,380
S-Seriously?

236
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,050
Yeah. But...

237
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,180
For all the other jobs, there were at least one or two people besides me

238
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,350
who got the same ranking.

239
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,770
I was the only one who got an A ranking for the Public Safety Bureau.

240
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,110
There were more than 500 students and I was the only one.

241
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:57,030
So I thought that there must have been something that only I could do at the Bureau.

242
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,200
If I went there, I thought I could find my purpose in life...

243
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,790
I thought I'd be able to find out why I was born here and now.

244
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,000
Do you think I'm wrong?

245
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,970
I don't know. What makes you think that someone like me would have any idea?

246
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,010
You could become anything.

247
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,970
You could choose any kind of life.

248
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,810
You've even agonized over it, right?

249
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,850
That's incredible.

250
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,020
You're just like those people from the days before Sibyl was created.

251
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,360
Nowadays, the Sibyl System reads your talent

252
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,690
and tells you the way of living that will bring you the most happiness.

253
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,820
And yet, you're talking about your purpose in life?

254
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,570
The reason you were born?

255
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,780
I never even imagined there were people who stressed over things like that!

256
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,000
I was flagged in a Psycho-Pass test when I was five.

257
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,790
I've been a latent criminal ever since.

258
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,880
No possibility for rehabilitation through treatment.

259
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,500
That's why I'm here now.

260
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,760
And I'd much rather be one of the Bureau's hunting dogs

261
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,260
and take on assassination jobs than spend the rest of my life in an isolation facility.

262
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,220
That was the only choice I had.

263
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,440
I wasn't planning to be mean to you or anything,

264
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,900
but I changed my mind. So I'll ask you again.

265
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,570
Why did you become an Inspector?

266
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,550
I'm so sorry!

267
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,010
You don't see many Inspectors who'd apologize to an Enforcer.

268
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,550
I guess you're angry, right?

269
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,600
That was your decision.

270
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,220
I have no right to complain.

271
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,310
Was my decision wrong?

272
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,190
Did I just stand in everyone's way and put them in danger?

273
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,910
I've been an Enforcer for a long time.

274
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:11,540
The hunting dogs' behavior of following orders to take down prey with neither hesitation nor doubt

275
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,500
is ingrained in my hands.

276
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,210
I just followed that gun's orders,

277
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,470
and shot many latent criminals.

278
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,510
It was for the good of society, I told myself.

279
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,310
It was easier to just accept that logic without question,

280
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,720
and past a certain point I didn't even think about it anymore.

281
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,190
I didn't even think to look back at myself and what I was doing.

282
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,190
I was a fool.

283
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,150
Being a detective isn't about bringing people down.

284
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,570
It's supposed to be about protecting people.

285
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,830
Kougami...

286
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,700
You decided what was right on your own.

287
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,040
You were able to put justice before your duty.

288
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,960
With a boss like you, I might be able to work as a detective, not just a dog.

289
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,640
Thank you very much!

290
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,640
You also don't see many Inspectors who'd bow to an Enforcer.

291
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
If you had time to think about it with a level head,

292
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,530
you would've tried not to shoot her, right?

293
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,280
I don't know.

294
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,570
I didn't hesitate at the time.

295
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,530
I thought I'd die if I hesitated.

296
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,030
I thought, "I don't want to die in a place like this.

297
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,040
I cannot die here, no matter what!"

298
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,920
That one thought consumed me.

299
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,130
I have unfinished business to take care of.

300
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,590
There's something I have to settle no matter what!

301
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,550
Kougami!

302
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,530
So, you're saying that you made the right decision at the time?

303
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,240
Is that your conclusion, Inspector Tsunemori?

304
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,910
Yes. Her Crime Coefficient was only temporarily elevated.

305
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,870
In fact, the therapy she's receiving after being taken into custody is going well,

306
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,370
and her Psycho-Pass is recovering.

307
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,290
Kougami, is there anything you want to say?

308
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,010
No. Inspector Tsunemori fulfilled her duty.

309
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,510
That is all.

310
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,450
It seems all fairy tales are dead

311
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,450
It seems all fairy tales are dead

312
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,790
In a hospital ward of brick stones

313
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,880
my voice is too coarse to sing

314
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,010
Outside in the foggy haze

315
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,600
a red moon glows

316
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,980
Look at me

317
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,520
Do not avert your gaze

318
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,820
Behind black bars

319
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,530
I was born

320
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,950
I wish there were a punishment for evil

321
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,830

nameless beasts

326
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,850
