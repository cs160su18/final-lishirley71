1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,521
Enforcement mode is Destroy Decomposer.

2
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:28,526
Target will be completely eliminated.

3
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:29,563
Please exercise caution.

4
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:41,569
Are you sure, Karanomori?

5
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,515
Yeah. The Drones are being remotely operated by...

6
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,587
Crap, where'd he go?

7
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:53,562
Find him!

8
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:54,587
There he is!

9
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:57,541
To the right!

10
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:05,521
They're civilians?

11
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,593
I'll send you to the scrap heap, you son of a bitch!

12
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:14,539
No! Don't go after it!

13
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,576
Hasuike!

14
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:17,552
Oh, crap!

15
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:19,531
Run away!

16
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:24,515
The fact that the Ministry of National Defense's Drones were hijacked is shocking enough on its own,

17
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:27,540
but for them to be controlled by a horde of random people?

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,540
That's unheard of.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,516
They probably aren't aware of what they're doing.

20
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:37,599
It's using a masking program made for border security drone operators.

21
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,545
That was close!

22
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:41,541
Masking program?

23
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,558
It converts video into a virtual Holo representation

24
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:46,535
to ensure that the operator's 
Psycho-Pass doesn't get affected.

25
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:51,501
It's making the video feed from the Drones look like a video game.

26
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,555
If you kill without intent,

27
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,576
what color are you?

28
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:58,556
Is that what you're trying to say...

29
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:02,564
Kamui?

30
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:03,502

31
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,070
I will go insane

32
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,504
if the world keeps ruining my life

33
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:26,554
I've stopped breathing

34
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:29,513
from the nervousness every day

35
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,505
Enigmatic feeling

36
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:39,597
I have to be the aggressor

37
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:42,564
The world has stopped making sense

38
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:44,552
It's dissolving

39
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,565
God has come to us

40
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:49,507
with sword in hand

41
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:53,590
The world has split in two

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,570
Half is mad,

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,570
and so am I

44
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,537
Where's the difference?

45
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:00,595
Where's the difference?

46
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:04,521
Only God can walk the borderline

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,588
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

48
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:11,542
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

49
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:14,555
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

50
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:17,584
I have no focus in my soul

51
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:21,547
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

52
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,552
I can't even look into the mirror

53
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:36,507
The game has been posted to multiple sites.

54
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,503
those who cast stones

55
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,503
those who cast stones

56
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,503
those who cast stones

57
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,503
those who cast stones

58
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,503
those who cast stones

59
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,503
those who cast stones

60
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,553
When we delete it, it gets re-uploaded within a few minutes.

61
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,503
those who cast stones

62
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,503
those who cast stones

63
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,500
It's like I'm chasing my tail.

64
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,503
Hungry Chicken!

65
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,503
Hungry Chicken!

66
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,503
Hungry Chicken!

67
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,503
Hungry Chicken!

68
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,503
Hungry Chicken!

69
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,503
Hungry Chicken!

70
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,503
Hungry Chicken!

71
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,503
Hungry Chicken!

72
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,504
Hungry Chicken!

73
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,504
Hungry Chicken!

74
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,504
Hungry Chicken!

75
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,504
Hungry Chicken!

76
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,504
Hungry Chicken!

77
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,504
Hungry Chicken!

78
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,504
Hungry Chicken!

79
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,504
Hungry Chicken!

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,521
It's only a matter of time before all the Drones at the port get hijacked.

81
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:51,554
Can't you gain control over them and shut them down?

82
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:56,513
It's a cloud-based app, so I'd need access to the cloud server.

83
00:03:56,588 --> 00:04:00,522
They've gone to a lot of trouble to mask the server's location,

84
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:01,585
so I'll need some time.

85
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,539
Please work as fast as you can so we can warn the players.

86
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,556
We need to stop this from spreading.

87
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,594
Dominators can only fire three Decomposer shots.

88
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:12,569
We're in a tight spot.

89
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,524
Yeah. In any case, we all need to get out of here.

90
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:25,591
You lured the Bureau into a game of cat and mouse.

91
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,558
No... There's more to it than that.

92
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:37,538
Kamui has been investigating how Dominators work.

93
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,501
He must know that we can disable Drones with Decomposer shots, and yet...

94
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,597
Does he have some other objective?

95
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:52,561
This is a warning to all Enforcers!

96
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:54,569
I forbid you to act alone!

97
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,503
You must coordinate with an Inspector!

98
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,528
The Drones are just decoys!

99
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:01,541
There's someone with a Dominator behind this!

100
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:14,525
Crime Coefficient is 322.

101
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:17,555
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

102
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,547
Y-You...

103
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:37,582
Inspector... Shisui?

104
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:41,565
Hunting dogs have no place 
in the world Kamui is creating.

105
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:48,579
How do you feel?

106
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,546
Very clear.

107
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:54,592
Even without a scan, I can tell that my Psycho-Pass isn't clouded at all.

108
00:05:56,521 --> 00:06:00,505
That's precisely your natural state of mind.

109
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:04,505
You've been set free. Congratulations.

110
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:07,547
It's all thanks to you, Kamui.

111
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:11,518
I don't deserve such kind words.

112
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:15,531
I did a terrible thing to you.

113
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,581
It's okay.

114
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,594
I...

115
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,586
I never liked my eyes anyway.

116
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:24,532
User authentication: Inspector Shisui Mizue.

117
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:26,528
Dominator usage approval confirmed.

118
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:33,533
That eye is essential to me.

119
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:38,521
It's perfect.

120
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:42,588
Now this Dominator will continue to recognize me as you.

121
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:46,539
I'm glad that my eye became yours.

122
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,522
If it can be of use to you, 
I want you to use my body as you please.

123
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:52,539
Thank you.

124
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,539
For now, let's proceed with our plan.

125
00:06:55,594 --> 00:07:00,502
His goal isn't to kill Enforcers?

126
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:04,520
Considering each incident so far, 
there's only one thing it could be.

127
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,507
Now I see.

128
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:12,508
So what you're actually after is...

129
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:16,517
Collecting Dominators.

130
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:28,564
He's been recording the progression of Inspector Tsunemori's Psycho-Pass?

131
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,593
He's been at it since he started here.

132
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:32,543
Every single day?!

133
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:34,502
How creepy!

134
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:42,502
Mika.

135
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:45,595
Where did you wander off to while your senior Inspector is in trouble?

136
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:47,520
Huh?

137
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,528
What in the...

138
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:55,504
Inspector Shisui activated two Dominators,

139
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:57,512
and they're heading in different directions?

140
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:01,554
It means someone else is using one of those Dominators in her place.

141
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:02,571
That doesn't make sense.

142
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:06,567
But there's no other way to explain it.

143
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,555
When Inspector Shimotsuki is ready, we'll go back them up.

144
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:11,589
Don't.

145
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,568
As long as our enemy has Dominators,

146
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,535
Enforcers need to stay away.

147
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:28,511
Aikawa!

148
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:56,552
Tsunemori!

149
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:57,598
Ginoza!

150
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,506
You all right?

151
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,598
We can't get through to the Inspectors from Division 3.

152
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:05,519
What should we do?

153
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,582
Karanomori.

154
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:11,557
Please send us the location of both the Dominators registered to Inspector Shisui.

155
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:13,562
Are you going after them?

156
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,591
All of you should prioritize your own safety and get out of here.

157
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,587
Don't tell me you're going alone!

158
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:23,571
Dominators can't kill Inspectors.

159
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:26,542
I'll have to capture Kamui on my own.

160
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,534
She's delusional!

161
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:35,505
I can't believe she's calling off Enforcers and moving herself to the front lines.

162
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:38,531
She thinks she's so great just because her Psycho-Pass is kinda clear.

163
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,548
I hope it gets clouded.

164
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:46,557
What am I saying?

165
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:50,574
That's reckless!

166
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:53,553
Those Dominators are surrounded by Drones!

167
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,599
Isn't it possible that the cloud server hosting that game is right in front of our eyes?

168
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:01,504
You're right.

169
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,521
Why didn't I think of that?!

170
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:10,597
If they're being controlled directly from the Drone 
management server at the Ministry of National Defense...

171
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:12,542
Bingo!

172
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:19,510
Now, crack the game program and terminate the Holo generated by the Psycho-Pass shielding program.

173
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,598
And show the players what's really going on?

174
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:25,540
That's the fastest route.

175
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,548
I'd expect no less from a Ministry of National Defense program.

176
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:31,574
Even terminating the Holo display 
seems to be quite the task.

177
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,570
I-I'll do it.

178
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,578
You can do it, Hinakawa?

179
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:40,516
Yeah... I have to help Akane.

180
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,541
I'll back him up.

181
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:45,529
Defeat the Evil Witch!

182
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:02,564
Akane, take a right at the hangar at the end of that path.

183
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:04,569
There are a few less Drones down there.

184
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,590
Eight playable Holos,

185
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,527
each constructed with fifteen different layers.

186
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,515
Analyze them quickly!

187
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:13,536
I-I'm on it.

188
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:31,592
Sugou!

189
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:33,563
Get up!

190
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:37,584
What the... Why can't I shoot?

191
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:41,518
Enforcement mode is Destroy Decomposer.

192
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:44,510
Target will be completely eliminated. 
Please exercise caution.

193
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:50,569
What the hell?!

194
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:56,511
Inspector!

195
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,511
Tougane?

196
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,524
Inspectors are supposed to do the babysitting.

197
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:01,574
Ginoza!

198
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,558
Don't make us do your job.

199
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,596
More importantly, what just happened?

200
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:08,579
That's a safety mechanism that 
keeps them from shooting each other.

201
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,500
The guns are designed to lock when multiple Drones of the same type

202
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,521
are within a certain shooting range.

203
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:17,580
You know this place like the back of your hand.

204
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:21,576
Yes. I've got a plan.

205
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:25,522
I might be able to incapacitate most of the Drones.

206
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:29,535
“Might"? And if you fail?

207
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:32,552
I'll die, that's all. It won't set you back.

208
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:38,536
Give me the details, Enforcer Sugou. I'll do it.

209
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:40,511
Tsunemori!

210
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,533
This is Shinjou from Division 3!

211
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:47,545
Everyone's dead. Please help me!

212
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:50,500
Calm down. We're headed your way now.

213
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:56,559
Crime Coefficient is 311.

214
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,568
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

215
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:02,505
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

216
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:05,501
Fuck!

217
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,502
Enforcer Shinjou!

218
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:09,510
Come in!

219
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:10,581
Shinjou!

220
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,590
Sugou, fill me in already!

221
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,561
That's an order!

222
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,586
An order?

223
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,536
Tsunemori, there's no need for you to...

224
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:22,557
Now! Before there are any more victims!

225
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,550
We need to get to the operations testing site up ahead.

226
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,546
Let's go.

227
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:33,575
Don't get ahead of yourself, Tsunemori!

228
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:43,564
Even under these circumstances, 
she's as clear as the sky.

229
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:47,531
And that's precisely why I want to color her black.

230
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:58,553
The Drones are all focusing on Inspector Tsunemori.

231
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,582
We'll use that to lure them in here.

232
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:03,520
What's this?

233
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:08,562
Drone firearms.

234
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,504
That's it, Akane. Keep it up.

235
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:17,546
What's going on?

236
00:14:56,508 --> 00:15:00,538
Enforcement mode is Destroy Decomposer.

237
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:03,526
Target will be completely eliminated.

238
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,522
Now!

239
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:34,596
Oh, crap! Game over!

240
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:41,530
There are five Dominators in Inspector Shisui's vicinity.

241
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,530
Kamui should be there too.

242
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,588
I think most of the Drones around here 
have been taken care of.

243
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:50,543
Given their current course, 
they may be planning to escape by sea.

244
00:15:53,543 --> 00:15:56,539
What are you going to do with that thing?

245
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,544
It's very likely that Dominators don't work on Kamui.

246
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:02,586
Are you trying to cloud your Psycho-Pass?

247
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,540
Call it a good luck charm.

248
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,503
What's going on?

249
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:17,500
"Continue"? All right!

250
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:22,525
They actually tampered with 
Public Safety's systems, too...

251
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:26,567
This just keeps getting worse.

252
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:38,594
I-It's...

253
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:40,548
It's done!

254
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:42,511
We're sending it your way, Shion!

255
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:43,590
You rock, Shou!

256
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,524
All right. Use it on the game program right away, and terminate the Holo being displayed.

257
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:53,591
Wait! Won't that show the players what's been happening in real life?

258
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:57,587
Do you have any idea how many people's Psycho-Passes will get clouded?!

259
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,592
Dealing with that is your job.

260
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:11,568
What do you think will happen if we just sit back and let them take control of every Drone?

261
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:17,598
This isn't how the Bureau operates!

262
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:21,560
You can't solve every problem by following the manual.

263
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,570
My Dominator's out of juice!

264
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,575
I'm sorry, Enforcer Ginoza.

265
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:46,513
Just shut up and run.

266
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,572
Okay!

267
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,518
Let's give it a whirl!

268
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,529
What the hell is this?!

269
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:39,501
The Drones have stopped moving!

270
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,510
All right!

271
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:45,502
An Area Stress warning has been issued.

272
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:46,556
I told you this would happen!

273
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:49,590
There's no way we can deal with all this!

274
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,594
Don't whine. You're an Inspector, aren't you?

275
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:55,586
Let's move out, Inspector Shimotsuki.

276
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:56,557
But...

277
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,595
Group Psycho-Pass pollution, huh?

278
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:08,504
It's as if Sibyl's weaknesses are being exposed one by one.

279
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:15,518
Kamui!

280
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:30,523
To think that the Dominator doesn't even recognize him...

281
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:32,598
A ghost...

282
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,599
Crime Coefficient is 28.

283
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,541
Not a target for enforcement action.

284
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,541
The trigger will be locked.

285
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:45,566
So this is your color. Remarkably clear, as I thought.

286
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,538
Who are you?

287
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,546
What are you after?

288
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:54,555
Inspector Tsunemori.

289
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:57,543
When judgment comes, I want you to see it with your own eyes.

290
00:19:58,518 --> 00:19:59,564
Judgment?

291
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,506
Wait!

292
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:07,556
I know you can't shoot.

293
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:16,536
Stop!

294
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,507
Tougane!

295
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:23,516
Leave the dirty work to us.

296
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,521
No!

297
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:52,548
All is calm, all is bright

298
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:59,524
A whispering angel falls to Earth

299
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:06,595
Now it eats your body whole

300
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:11,592
It's my fault

301
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:25,547
You open your eyes

302
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,581
and in their grey-blue depth

303
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,523
I see your coldness

304
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,569
Call my name and give me a kiss

305
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:35,532
Embrace me

306
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:42,511
with your empty body

307
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,503
There is still life of sorts

308
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,503
There is still life of sorts

309
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,503
left within you

310
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,503
left within you

311
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,504
left within you

312
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,504
left within you

313
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:49,500
left within you

314
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:50,500
in blood red

315
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:51,500
in blood red

316
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:52,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

317
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:53,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

318
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:54,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

319
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,500
You sing to me of it

320
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:56,500
You sing to me of it

321
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:57,500
What was I born for?

322
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,500
What was I born for?

323
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,501
What was I born for?

324
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:00,501
What was I born for?

325
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:01,501
What was I born for?

326
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,560
Love me

327
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:07,535
Don't let me go

328
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:08,501
Don't let me go

329
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:09,502
Don't let me go

330

This is a world where the mental state and personal tendencies of humans can be quantified. 
While all sorts of inclinations are recorded and policed, these measured numbers used to judge people's souls are commonly called "Psycho-Pass".

333
