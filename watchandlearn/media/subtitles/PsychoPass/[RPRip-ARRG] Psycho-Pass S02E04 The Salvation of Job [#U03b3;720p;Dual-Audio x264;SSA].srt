1
00:00:01,096 --> 00:00:04,083
Inspector Aoyanagi, come in.

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:06,081
Inspector Aoyanagi!

3
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:26,000
The medicine they give you here modulates your Hue,

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,055
but in doing so, it slowly drains you of what makes you feel alive.

5
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:43,073
I will free you from this false cure...

6
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:45,088
just like Kamui does.

7
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:50,011
If you help me, I'll make it worth your while!

8
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:53,041
I'll put in a good word for you 
at the Ministry of Welfare!

9
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,010
Just call Kamui in already!

10
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,013
Inspector Shimotsuki, please bring Representative Masuda to me.

11
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,012
I'll handle the interrogation.

12
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:06,008
Because you're unwilling to defer to someone who doubts Kamui's existence?

13
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:11,005
It's because we should question him 
based on the evidence left at the scene.

14
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:14,051
Understood.

15
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:21,021
It's hard to think that this is a coincidence, but we need some hard evidence.

16
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:23,056
Otherwise, we'll make the same mistake we made with Kitazawa.

17
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,087
Take a look at this.

18
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:28,052
This space was left open when the 
Drone's impact absorber was removed.

19
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:32,094
Don't you think a person could easily fit in there?

20
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:37,091
The Drone was discovered about two kilometers away from the crime scene.

21
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:41,005
Although it's quite rare, Drones can malfunction.

22
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:44,012
But if this was a result of human tampering, there should've been a record of it.

23
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:49,008
In that case, Kamui must have a 
means of doctoring a Drone's logs.

24
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:52,018
So you're sticking with the assumption that he exists?

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,068
Will you not explore this under that premise?

26
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:58,026
No, I'll play along until you're satisfied.

27
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,086
This was a calculated maneuver.

28
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:05,085
We're left trying to dig up some definitive proof while Kamui is out there making his next move.

29
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,088
There's no more doubt in my mind.

30
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,015
Kamui does exist.

31
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:28,087
I will go insane

32
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:31,021
if the world keeps ruining my life

33
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:35,071
I've stopped breathing

34
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,030
in view of the end of days

35
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,022
Enigmatic feeling

36
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:49,014
I have to be the aggressor

37
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,081
The world has stopped making sense

38
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:53,069
It's dissolving

39
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,082
God has come to us

40
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:58,024
with sword in hand

41
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,011
Who are you?

42
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,007
The world has split in two

43
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:04,087
Half is mad,

44
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:06,087
and so am I

45
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,054
Where's the difference?

46
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,012
Where's the difference?

47
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:13,038
Only God can walk the borderline

48
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:17,005
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

49
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:20,059
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

50
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:23,072
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

51
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:27,001
I have no focus in my soul

52
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:30,064
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

53
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:33,069
I can't even look into the mirror

54
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,001
the salvation of job

55
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,001
the salvation of job

56
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:48,058
No luck accessing either the security cameras or the scanners.

57
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,002
the salvation of job

58
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,002
the salvation of job

59
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:45,002
the salvation of job

60
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:45,002
the salvation of job

61
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,002
the salvation of job

62
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,002
the salvation of job

63
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:50,083
The entire building is dead.

64
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,084
Has anything like this 
ever happened before?

65
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:57,033
The only cases I can think of are 
big disasters like fires breaking out.

66
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,053
This doesn't exactly fit the bill, though.

67
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:00,038
Hey.

68
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:04,008
The Area Stress Level has 
climbed into the warning range.

69
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,050
What on earth is the Inspector doing?

70
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:15,048
These are your natural selves, as you were born.

71
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,094
Do you feel the joy of being alive?

72
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:23,035
That's right. Good.

73
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,004
I understand your pain all too well.

74
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:33,046
Rather than having your minds healed, 
you're on the verge of being killed by false medication.

75
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:39,038
Let the stress in. It's the proof 
that we are alive in this world.

76
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,088
Feel!

77
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:44,089
Feel the pain!

78
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:46,025
Feel your heart beating!

79
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:47,050
Feel your life!

80
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:56,035
It's so great to be alive.

81
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,078
Let's request assistance.

82
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:06,009
In any case, we're sidelined 
without an Inspector present.

83
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,024
Oh, I'm well aware.

84
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:12,041
I'll handle the assistance request from Division 2.

85
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:17,033
Thanks. Given the timing, 
please make sure you use discretion.

86
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,040
This isn't a big deal.

87
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,063
I'm sure the people who got 
trapped inside have just panicked.

88
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:29,022
It's certainly easy for confusion and fear 
to spread within mental care facilities, but...

89
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:34,056
Do you think that even something like this is too overwhelming for a tenderfoot Inspector?

90
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:36,000
Huh?

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,066
I'm sure you're quite pleased now that 
someone else has mentioned Kamui, aren't you?

92
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,046
It's rather the opposite.

93
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:49,020
Thanks for bringing him in. 
Leave the rest to me.

94
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,012
And be careful.

95
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:53,062
You sure are confident.

96
00:05:55,087 --> 00:06:00,015
Why would Aoyanagi go to a 
mental care facility, of all places?

97
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:03,099
I don't know, but let's focus 
on the interrogation for now.

98
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:10,008
Thank you for your cooperation, Representative Masuda Koutoku.

99
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:14,006
Who is Kamui?

100
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,006
That doesn't ring any bells.

101
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:21,001
I hear you wanted us to call Kamui in.

102
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,097
I don't recall.

103
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:30,062
You relied on someone named Kamui 
in order to keep your Psycho-Pass clear.

104
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,043
How did you communicate with him?

105
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,075
Where did you make contact?

106
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,049
So suddenly he's got nothing to say?

107
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:45,096
This is strange.

108
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,031
Don't move.

109
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:05,072
What are you doing?

110
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,033
I'm sorry. He... He ordered me to do it.

111
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,044
You are all alive!

112
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,092
Everyone... Everyone is alive!

113
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,084
Life is wonderful.

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,030
This is terrible.

115
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:34,025
No.

116
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:35,095
Don't do it.

117
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:36,093
But...

118
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:38,072
Don't worry. Just trust me.

119
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,069
I'm going to save them all.

120
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,011
Because it's my job.

121
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,055
What's the situation?

122
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:53,055
We still don't know what's 
going on inside the facility.

123
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:59,064
There haven't been any incidents reported nearby, but the Area Stress Level keeps going up.

124
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:03,013
It's almost certain that 
this place is the source.

125
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:04,075
We should force it open 
from the outside.

126
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:09,064
No. We need to pinpoint the cause 
of the stress before taking any action.

127
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:14,024
If we carelessly release them, 
the situation might get worse.

128
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:18,043
So our only option is to find a way 
to make contact with someone inside.

129
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:23,089
I narrowed the Area Stress check 
down to the building's immediate vicinity.

130
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:25,084
See for yourselves.

131
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,082
It's way over the emergency threshold.

132
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,078
I wouldn't be surprised if everyone 
in there were a target for enforcement.

133
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,049
Someone else mentioned Kamui's name.

134
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,075
In addition, one of the Drones sent to defuse the bombs had been moved and was missing a part.

135
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,009
This could be a breakthrough for the Devil's Proof.

136
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,054
Is that what you're implying?

137
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:51,051
The man we brought in is hiding something.

138
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:55,004
Can you help me, Professor?

139
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:03,083
I want to be a savior!

140
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,060
I want to save people, just like Kamui does!

141
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:31,017
That's enough!

142
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:36,000
So this representative, Masuda,

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,085
experienced a clouding in his Hue 
before giving his speech.

144
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,032
And you're certain of that?

145
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,043
Yes.

146
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:48,006
After the speech, Inspector Shimotsuki took him into custody.

147
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,035
It's often the case that this sort of person's Hue 
will consistently worsen under like circumstances.

148
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,054
Look into the days he gave speeches over the past several months.

149
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:00,002
His phone records, too.

150
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:02,047
A savior? Don't make me laugh.

151
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:06,096
You're just a crazy latent criminal. Either surrender now and be sent to a facility, or be judged where you stand.

152
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:09,065
Crime Coefficient is 76.

153
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:11,092
Not a target for enforcement action.

154
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:13,038
The trigger will be locked.

155
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:13,038
Why?!

156
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:15,092
Good. Keep it up.

157
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:20,034
You of all these people should 
understand very well what I'm saying.

158
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:24,056
Fuck... Why is this...

159
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:24,025
Crime Coefficient is 112.

160
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,056
A target for enforcement action.

161
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,052
No! Not him!

162
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,098
I'm detecting the use of a Dominator.

163
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:33,072
Is Inspector Aoyanagi the user?

164
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:36,020
There's a target for enforcement inside.

165
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,056
What should we do?

166
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:39,032
Nothing.

167
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:42,007
We'll await contact from Inspector Aoyanagi.

168
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:47,079
If we act on our own and something goes wrong, it'll be on my shoulders.

169
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:51,065
We've received a response from the Analysis Lab.

170
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:57,021
They've identified the device Representative Masuda 
was contacting one day before each of his speeches.

171
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,072
Who's the user?

172
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,025
That's still unknown,

173
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:06,014
but the device is currently at 
the mental care facility in Shibuya.

174
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:11,038
The place where Division 2 requested assistance?

175
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,056
That means...

176
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:14,002
Kamui is there!

177
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,047
Inspector Aoyanagi. We're currently standing by in front of the facility.

178
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:34,071
Please report back with the status inside.

179
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,080
To those who use force to suppress those trying to live healthy lives:

180
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,064
Heed my words!

181
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:45,010
What?!

182
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:56,094
I know full well what becomes of those who have 
all their stress taken away by erroneous medication.

183
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,086
Eustress deficiency.

184
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:07,012
I no longer responded to stimuli, and I felt numb inside.

185
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:10,089
I was ready to give up on my own life.

186
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:20,014
The reality of destructive mental care that sucks 
the joy of living out of people must be overthrown!

187
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:23,032
And I will save them, just as Kamui has saved me!

188
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,022
Kamui?!

189
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:29,023
Not again... What is this, some kind of shared psychosis?!

190
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:33,058
He's even bringing up a stupid 
urban legend like eustress deficiency.

191
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,019
An urban legend?

192
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:38,058
Did you hear back from Inspector Aoyanagi?

193
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,090
Not yet, even though 
she was online at one point.

194
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:49,062
Couldn't the man we just heard have restrained everyone? 
If so, we should subdue him and rescue them right away.

195
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:53,008
But no one's called for anything like that yet.

196
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,000
Kamui again...

197
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,033
What the hell is going on?

198
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,084
Hinakawa, come in.

199
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,025
Y-Yes, ma'am.

200
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:07,073
Look around for anyone with an active Holo in the area.

201
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:09,056
What kind of Holo?

202
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:13,067
I don't know if it's the same woman from the Kitazawa case or not,

203
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,002
but you're the only one who can figure it out.

204
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:17,013
Please.

205
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,098
U-Understood.

206
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:23,023
I see. Considering that the Holo 
we saw was abnormally elaborate,

207
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:26,070
Kamui could very well have 
a strong obsession with them.

208
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,091
Like the clothing a ghost would wear?

209
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:34,020
If this is all part of Kamui's plan, 
then what could he be after?

210
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,050
Why is he going this far?

211
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:40,049
No, not here.

212
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,088
No, not here...

213
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:46,025
No. No...

214
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,089
Excuse me. What are you doing?

215
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:52,047
I... I got an order from Inspector Tsunemori...

216
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:56,038
Don't act on your own. I'm the commanding officer here.

217
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:57,049
But...

218
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:14,067
Division 3 will take over from here.

219
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,083
Just follow our instructions.

220
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,042
What?! By what authority do you...

221
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:23,022
These orders come straight from Chief Kasei.

222
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:25,040
We'll carry out enforcement immediately.

223
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,009
Chief Kasei took me off? Why?

224
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:35,034
Yes, that's right.

225
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:40,000
Scatter the crowd and don't let any media organizations into the area.

226
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,098
It'll be problematic if a groundless delusion 
such as eustress deficiency is allowed to spread.

227
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:54,016
Though no one in this society 
would believe in such a thing.

228
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:57,058
There's one common thread 
between this case and the first one.

229
00:14:57,058 --> 00:15:00,087
They separated and isolated 
an Inspector from her team.

230
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:03,012
Kamui's targeting Inspectors?

231
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:06,005
Or maybe not Inspectors themselves, but rather...

232
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,062
Dominators instead.

233
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:16,067
It wouldn't be possible under normal circumstances, but it may not have been Inspector Shisui who shot Enforcer Yamatoya.

234
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,002
It was Kamui?

235
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,023
Someone was somehow able to use a Dominator without authorization.

236
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,072
That case itself was an experiment for that.

237
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,099
That's enough, Tsunemori.

238
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,028
Your Psycho-Pass will get clouded!

239
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,016
A ghost...

240
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:37,024
Even if we can't see it, 
we can still follow its trail.

241
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,020
Okay, commence operation!

242
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,043
The Public Safety Bureau. How foolish.

243
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:06,014
I am... an Inspector.

244
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,053
Elevated Area Stress Level

245
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,053
m 0 0 l 100 0 100 100 0 100

246
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,053
Special Warning Issued

247
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:17,080
An elevated Area Stress Level hazard warning!

248
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,099
There's no way that anyone inside 
can sustain a stable Psycho-Pass now.

249
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:22,052
An experiment...

250
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:25,071
Kamui is trying to learn 
how to use a Dominator.

251
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:29,017
But he's already shot one Enforcer.

252
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:33,025
If being surrounded by Bureau officers was also part of his design,

253
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,015
his goal this time isn't to pull the trigger himself.

254
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,006
Are you saying that he wants someone else to shoot, then?

255
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:43,078
With such a roundabout way of doing things, 
who the hell is he trying to...

256
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:11,055
In order to protect citizens and the law, I will...

257
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,039
They shot through the wall?

258
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:27,031
That's the Bureau's new armament, the Assault Dominator.

259
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:31,020
When walls hinder access to the crime scene, 
we've got this to fall back on.

260
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,014
Looks like it went extremely well.

261
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:34,028
"Extremely well"?

262
00:17:34,028 --> 00:17:40,078
You think something that can elevate the stress of those inside 
so severely as to trigger Eliminator mode is a good thing?

263
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,025
Kunizuka...

264
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:46,021
I'm just following orders.

265
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:49,066
You're certain the one you shot was the culprit?

266
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:54,063
I don't know. I just shot the one 
with the higher Crime Coefficient.

267
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,029
Help!

268
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:04,002
We're the victims!

269
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:08,012
Crime Coefficient is 322.

270
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:11,012
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

271
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:12,090
What the hell is this number?!

272
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:18,032
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

273
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:20,032
Everyone is a target for enforcement!

274
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,049
Don't let them escape!

275
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,030
How terrible...

276
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,001

Inspector Shimotsuki!

277
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:39,034
What can I do? This case no longer belongs to Division 1.

278
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,047
We have nothing to do with it.

279
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,019
Stop!

280
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,011
What are you...

281
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,047
What are you doing?!

282
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,080
I now know the answer.

283
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,046
Inspectors can be judged by the Dominators too.

284
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:12,034
Thank you.

285
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:16,085
With your help, we were able 
to move one step forward.

286
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,020
Let's go.

287
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,043
I've prepared our escape route.

288
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,089
I wonder what color I am now.

289
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:29,016
When I met you,

290
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:34,080
I was a walking corpse whose life had 
lost its color due to eustress deficiency.

291
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,078
But I'm different now.

292
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:40,090
I was finally able to get my presence back.

293
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,069
Please let me stay here.

294
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:49,083
I've done all I can.

295
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:53,085
You can change the world.

296
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:56,012
I'm glad that I met you, Kamui.

297
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:57,040
Thank you.

298
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:05,053
Can you see it?

299
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:09,038
The color of the blood we shed?

300
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,010
Why don't you tell me: What color are we?

301
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,060
It can't be... Aoyanagi...

302
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,087
Inspector Tsunemori.

303
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:40,005
This question may be directed toward all of society.

304
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,016
All of society?

305
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,063
Asking each of us to question our color. As well as...

306
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:50,010
Sibyl... What color are you?

307
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:52,077
All is calm, all is bright

308
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:59,053
A whispering angel falls to Earth

309
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:07,024
Now it eats your body whole

310
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:12,037
It's my fault

311
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:25,076
You open your eyes

312
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,010
and in their grey-blue depth

313
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,052
I see your coldness

314
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:32,098
Call my name and give me a kiss

315
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:35,061
Embrace me

316
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:42,040
with your empty body

317
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,003
There is still life of sorts

318
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,003
There is still life of sorts

319
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,003
left within you

320
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:46,003
left within you

321
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:47,003
left within you

322
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,003
left within you

323
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,004
left within you

324
