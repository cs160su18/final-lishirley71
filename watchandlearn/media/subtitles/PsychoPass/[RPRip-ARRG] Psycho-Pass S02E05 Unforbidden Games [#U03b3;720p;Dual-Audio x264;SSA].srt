1
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,599
So it went well?

2
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:13,508
Yeah.

3
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,512
Did you kill her?

4
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:20,513
An Enforcer did.

5
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:21,542
Does it hurt to know she's dead?

6
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,551
I don't know.

7
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:27,588
Although I do feel a little sad.

8
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:30,584
Looks like you've been following my dosage instructions.

9
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:33,560
How about I check your Hue?

10
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:36,591
It's clear.

11
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:42,546
I can't believe how little medicine it took to make me feel this much better

12
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:44,544
despite it supposedly being ineffective.

13
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:47,519
Prescriptions should be unique to the individual.

14
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,561
Ignoring that fact and prescribing heavy doses

15
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:52,587
is no better than using violence.

16
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:57,537
Why are you helping me become clear?

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,554
Because I want you to keep your own free will.

18
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,529
My own will?

19
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:04,503
Yeah.

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,596
Stay by my side.

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,526
I'll do anything you ask.

22
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:18,541
Thank you.

23
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:21,539
Sibyl...

24
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:24,561
It won't be long

25
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,536
before I bring you to justice.

26
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:33,507
I'll go check the back door.

27
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:35,555
Okay.

28
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:58,564
Crime Coefficient is 26.

29
00:01:58,564 --> 00:02:00,564
An Inspector registered at the CID.

30
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:02,527
Warning.

31
00:02:02,527 --> 00:02:05,510
Any rebellious conduct by Enforcers

32
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,507
will be recorded and reported to headquarters.

33
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,557
How very clear.

34
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:19,595
What's with him?

35
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:36,568
I will go insane

36
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:39,501
if the world keeps ruining my life

37
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:43,552
I've stopped breathing

38
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:46,510
from the nervousness every day

39
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,502
Enigmatic feeling

40
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,595
I have to be the aggressor

41
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:59,562
The world has stopped making sense

42
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,549
It's dissolving

43
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:03,562
God has come to us

44
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:06,504
with sword in hand

45
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,588
The world has split in two

46
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,567
Half is mad,

47
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,567
and so am I

48
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,534
Where's the difference?

49
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:17,593
Where's the difference?

50
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:21,518
Only God can walk the borderline

51
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,585
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

52
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:28,540
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

53
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,552
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

54
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:34,582
I have no focus in my soul

55
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:38,545
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

56
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:41,549
I can't even look into the mirror

57
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:51,500
unforbidden games

58
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:51,500
unforbidden games

59
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:53,559
Impressive as usual.

60
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:52,500
unforbidden games

61
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:52,500
unforbidden games

62
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:53,500
unforbidden games

63
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:53,500
unforbidden games

64
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,563
Already finished reading the case files?

65
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:54,501
unforbidden games

66
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:54,501
unforbidden games

67
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:59,555
I should be the one telling you that.

68
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:00,535
Huh?

69
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:05,502
It's only been a day since that truly awful incident,

70
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:08,539
and yet you're so calm.

71
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,575
Are you really human?

72
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,513
Some people might take that the wrong way.

73
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:19,528
I'd be lying if I said it didn't shock me.

74
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:23,595
More than that, it makes me feel like I have to work even harder.

75
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:25,533
I see.

76
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,546
Sorry, but I'll get straight to the point.

77
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:30,554
I'd like to ask you to interrogate Representative Masuda.

78
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,584
The representative, huh?

79
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:36,526
He's calm at this point, right?

80
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:38,597
Unnaturally so.

81
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:43,560
He could be part of a trap...

82
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,593
Is that what you're thinking?

83
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:48,531
By analyzing the logs,

84
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:52,540
we think we've succeeded in pinpointing Kamui's hideout.

85
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,553
We've already sent in Drones, but...

86
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,595
You'll probably end up going there yourself anyway.

87
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:05,554
There's no doubt that it was 
Inspector Shisui's voice on the phone.

88
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:09,529
She's the one who called Inspector Aoyanagi to the scene.

89
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,570
If Kamui is capable of winning over an Inspector,

90
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,550
there's no way he'd leave a trace 
for us to get a lead on him this easily.

91
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:21,547
So you think he's really that good.

92
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:24,521
Enough to think that we should be on guard.

93
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:29,579
Just yesterday, we couldn't detect his Psycho-Pass 
despite the fact that he had to have been at the crime scene.

94
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,519
Is that not reminiscent of someone?

95
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,536
Makishima Shougo.

96
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,565
I suppose he does give off a similarly eerie vibe.

97
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:43,507
But there's something different this time.

98
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,549
If we can figure out what that something is,

99
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,500
we'll probably get closer to Kamui's true identity, right?

100
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,546
That's one of the reasons I came to you.

101
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:56,579
Sorry, but I'm not a magician.

102
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,530
I can't pull on a string and turn it into flowers.

103
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:03,526
You're just being modest.

104
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:08,501
Are you leaving?

105
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,568
Be very careful.

106
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,523
Division 3 will be joining us for this investigation.

107
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:16,556
That should give us enough firepower.

108
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,590
I'm surprised the Chief is going along with this.

109
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,586
Well...

110
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:23,534
She probably isn't keen on the strategy itself,

111
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:26,599
but she must've decided the 
best option was to hedge her bets.

112
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:31,525
Like I said, impressive as usual.

113
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:37,513
I do understand that there's no 
basis whatsoever for her actions.

114
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:46,501
However, she's easier to handle as a part of the chain of command rather than as an autonomous entity.

115
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:50,577
In any event, our losses thus far aren't 
so substantial as to warrant taking action.

116
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:56,502
Though it will take some time to replace the Inspectors that have fallen.

117
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,594
As for the surplus Enforcers, 
assigning them to other Inspectors

118
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,561
will allow us to keep them operational.

119
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:10,516
The name's Hasuike Kaede. I've been transferred to Division 1 as of today.

120
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,529
What a warm welcome.

121
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:34,568
I hear you've been transferred to Division 1.

122
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:36,535
Yes.

123
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:39,531
You were a friend of Inspector Aoyanagi's.

124
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:42,513
You both started working here in the same year.

125
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:45,511
She was also your boss.

126
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,503
I...

127
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,528
You carried out enforcement 
on a latent criminal. That's all.

128
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:52,541
You did nothing wrong.

129
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:54,511
But...

130
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,550
Just...

131
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:58,596
I don't want you showing your 
face around me for a long time.

132
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,526
I'm scared.

133
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:09,522
I saw such a terrible thing happen right before my eyes.

134
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:13,576
I want to tell myself that this won't change me, but...

135
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:17,591
Kunizuka...

136
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:25,519
It's okay.

137
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:28,524
Even Inspectors have the right to cry.

138
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,524
Right.

139
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:34,570
Yayoi.

140
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,558
Yes?

141
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:41,521
What do you think of Tougane Sakuya?

142
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:47,538
I think he's an excellent Enforcer 
with outstanding judgment and ability.

143
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:50,543
I guess you're right.

144
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,518
I see.

145
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:59,564
So I'm in charge of this case, am I?

146
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:05,569
But no matter how much you blame me,
 I can't take responsibility for it all...

147
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,557
because we can't change the past.

148
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,553
Let's just do our best to make use of that which was brought to life...

149
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,545
in order that we may evolve.

150
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,525
Besides, aren't you curious?

151
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,585
It will be interesting to see how this affects her.

152
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,551
We'll be arriving soon.

153
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,547
Our destination is a military Drone testing site.

154
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,589
Our purpose is strictly investigation.

155
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,589
However, equipment with Hazard Level B 
has been permitted as a precautionary measure.

156
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:45,519
Also, this operation is being carried out in tandem by Division 1 and Division 3.

157
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:51,574
Enforcers are expected to consider the situation and follow any appropriate instructions,

158
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:54,537
regardless of who your lead Inspector is.

159
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:58,595
I didn't think I'd ever come back here.

160
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:03,517
Inspector, is there a point in taking so many people with you?

161
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:06,513
The Chief assigned all personnel herself.

162
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:09,551
The interrogation of Representative Masuda,

163
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,584
the analysis of the barricade incident site,

164
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:15,543
and the Holo analysis you requested...

165
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:18,539
We've got so much to do that 
we're about to explode over here.

166
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:23,535
I only gave everyone tasks that I determined they could handle.

167
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:26,531
I'm saying that it might actually be too much to handle.

168
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:30,569
Besides, Drones have already 
investigated that site, haven't they?

169
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:33,578
There are things that can only be discovered by seeing a scene in person.

170
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:36,520
That way of thinking is out of date.

171
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,587
Just because an approach is new 
doesn't necessarily mean it's right.

172
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:42,554
We've arrived at the site. I'm going to hang up.

173
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,541
Inspector Shimotsuki.

174
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:55,522
The Ministry of Welfare has instructed us to release Representative Masuda given the improvement in his Hue.

175
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,522
What?

176
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:00,589
No matter how you look at it, 
someone's putting pressure on us.

177
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:07,523
Japanese society has always been 
held up by the vitality of its citizens.

178
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:11,519
We can't just dismiss the Ministry of Welfare's orders.

179
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:11,519
I have been stressing that, in order to maintain that vitality,

180
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,515
we need to provide security and well-being above all else.

181
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:16,520
Even feigning ignorance would probably buy us no more than a day or two.

182
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,537
This place used to be a trading port.

183
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:25,533
After the port was closed, it was used as an unmanned warehouse.

184
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:31,584
Then, the Ministry of National Defense's Military Drones Research and Development department set their sights on it.

185
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:41,560
There's enough space to store parts and equipment, 
not to mention the Drones themselves.

186
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,547
In addition,

187
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:45,527
it's unmanned, so accidents are unlikely.

188
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:49,561
There's no better place for conducting active military Drone experiments.

189
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:53,511
I see.

190
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,532
Whoa!

191
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:14,571
Next up is the test on data synchronization between two Drones.

192
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,503
Is that you, Sugou?

193
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,539
It's been a while!

194
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:26,543
I don't think I've seen you 
since you went to the facility.

195
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:28,514
When did you come back?

196
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:30,598
I didn't exactly come back.

197
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:31,577
What?

198
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:34,507
I'm an Enforcer with the Public Safety Bureau.

199
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:38,536
Oh... I see.

200
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:39,574
I have to get back to my post.

201
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:41,541
I'll see you later.

202
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:47,541
I see. So he used to work here.

203
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,535
Nothing out of the ordinary, huh?

204
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:54,513
Can't we just stand by for orders?

205
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:59,509
Why don't we leave the rest to Division 1,
 since they're so gung-ho about this?

206
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,505
Chief Kasei's favorite, huh?

207
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:05,510
Having to work with her is such a pain in the ass.

208
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:11,523
No one can enter this area without authorization, 
and there's no chance that anyone's been living here.

209
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:14,569
That's what the operations manager said, right?

210
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:18,515
Yeah. There's no record of anyone 
other than the staff having been present.

211
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:23,524
Cymatic scans are inconsequential to a ghost.

212
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,529
What he really needs to look out for are human eyes.

213
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,546
Somewhere that has scanners installed

214
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,579
and is also deserted.

215
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:37,534
Dead end.

216
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:42,530
Tougane?

217
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,530
The building on the left

218
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:48,527
has emergency exits facing the street.

219
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:54,540
That being the case, it's unnatural that the building next to it would have nothing but a wall.

220
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,565
A structurally unnecessary wall, at that.

221
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:00,562
It's within the range of cymatic scans' monitoring,

222
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:05,532
and it's the deepest end of a deserted path.

223
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:07,545
It's a Holo.

224
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,541
I think this is what they call a detective's intuition.

225
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:18,521
I've submitted my reports to you plenty of times, Chief.

226
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,597
There's a problem with the way 
Inspector Tsunemori conducts herself.

227
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,518
What do you think about that?

228
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:29,564
Oh, it doesn't concern me much.

229
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:34,598
Don't you think that kind of behavior can be dangerous?

230
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,556
Oh?

231
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,536
She's excessively hands-on,

232
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:42,549
her judgment is easily compromised due to her groundless obsessions,

233
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,503
and the way she treats Enforcers...

234
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:50,599
Inspector Tsunemori has major issues in all these areas.

235
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,562
And your point is?

236
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:58,571
I believe that helping a colleague 
come to her senses is part of my job.

237
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,505
Is that all you wanted to discuss?

238
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:03,597
No. There's one more thing.

239
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,505
I am concerned about a troubling action taken by Enforcer Tougane Sakuya.

240
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:15,573
Are you referring to his pointing 
a Dominator at an Inspector?

241
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:16,544
Yes.

242
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,548
He might have been concerned about 
Inspector Tsunemori's mental state, just as you are.

243
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,507
Though it's true that it wasn't 
the best way to go about it.

244
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:31,537
Inspector Tsunemori pays no mind to the risk posed by Enforcers, who are latent criminals.

245
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,571
I have no doubt that this will escalate eventually.

246
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,579
When that happens, could you...

247
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:40,579
consider giving her treatment?

248
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,542
I'll think about it.

249
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:47,505
Please do not forget what you just said.

250
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:50,535
Excuse me.

251
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:55,502
That girl will be eaten alive.

252
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:05,561
This is...

253
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:13,549
A face transplant mask?

254
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:15,579
This is strange.

255
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,521
What did he need these for?

256
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,584
In order to maintain Japan's vitality,

257
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:26,555
we must ensure the security and well-being of its people.

258
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:30,564
I have consistently held this position

259
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:29,572
What a complete farce.

260
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,564
Huh?

261
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:32,568
ever since I was first elected.

262
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,560
Japan has always been supported by the vitality of its citizens...

263
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:43,502
I've watched videos of all your speeches over the past three years.

264
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:45,578
You certainly have a way with words.

265
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:52,532
Charisma is a necessary skill 
for a politician, wouldn't you say?

266
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:58,508
One of the distinguishing characteristics 
you've had ever since becoming a representative

267
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,575
would have to be that masterful enunciation of yours.

268
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:06,571
You purposely dial it down for the vital points, and as a result, the audience is captivated.

269
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:09,555
The balance is superb.

270
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:10,572
No...

271
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,518
It was, I should say.

272
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:15,514
In the videos of your past speeches, at least.

273
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:21,523
Your recent speeches have paled in comparison, though I'll give your imitation points for effort.

274
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:23,502
Just...

275
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,511
Who are you?

276
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,553
Oh?

277
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:32,586
Is something wrong?

278
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:37,520
The new Hungry Chicken is already out!

279
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,583
Seriously? Did they even announce it?

280
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,500
Hungry Chicken!

281
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,500
Hungry Chicken!

282
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,500
Hungry Chicken!

283
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,500
Hungry Chicken!

284
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,591
A video game?

285
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,583
I keep telling you to put that stuff away while on duty, don't I?

286
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,525
Come on, just let me play a little.

287
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:47,500
Hungry Chicken!

288
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:47,500
Hungry Chicken!

289
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:47,500
Hungry Chicken!

290
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:47,500
Hungry Chicken!

291
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:53,584
Whoa...

292
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:07,596
What the hell?!

293
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:20,545
Die, small fries.

294
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:32,592
I won't let you get away!

295
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,556
Inspector!

296
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,590
Looks like he was expecting us.

297
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:53,536
You are a messenger.

298
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:56,595
You got arrested on purpose and lured in the Bureau with the information you provided.

299
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:00,574
But what's your goal?

300
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:03,500
What are you trying to achieve

301
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:04,596
by roping in the CID?

302
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:06,500
SENDING SHUTDOWN SIGNAL

303
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:10,563
It's not stopping!

304
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:11,588
Why?!

305
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:32,507
What the hell's going on?!

306
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,503
Hungry Chicken!

307
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,503
Hungry Chicken!

308
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,503
Hungry Chicken!

309
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,503
Hungry Chicken!

310
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,500
What're you doing?!

311
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,512
Stop them already!

312
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,529
It's not working!

313
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,504
The shutdown signal keeps getting rejected!

314
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:52,509
Three Drones have just been activated in Block F!

315
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:56,501
All Drones in Block G and Block H are active!

316
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,513
This can't be...

317
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:03,581
I'm in luck!

318
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:23,512
Game on, Bureau.

319
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,571
This is...

320
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:33,525
Door unlocked by Inspector's request.

321
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:49,581
What the hell is this?

322
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:52,548
All is calm, all is bright

323
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:59,524
A whispering angel falls to Earth

324
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:06,595
Now it eats your body whole

325
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:11,592
It's my fault

326
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:25,547
You open your eyes

327
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,581
and in their grey-blue depth

328
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,523
I see your coldness

329
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,569
Call my name and give me a kiss

00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:42,511
with your empty body

332
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,503
There is still life of sorts

333
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,503

334
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,503
left within you

335
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,503

00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:51,500

343
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:54,500
I can see a brilliant eternity

344
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,500
You sing to me of it

345
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:56,500
You sing to me of it

346
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:57,500
What was I born for?

347
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,500
What was I born for?

348
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,501

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,560
Love me

352
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:07,535
Don't let me go

353
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:08,501
Don't let me go

354

Don't let me go
