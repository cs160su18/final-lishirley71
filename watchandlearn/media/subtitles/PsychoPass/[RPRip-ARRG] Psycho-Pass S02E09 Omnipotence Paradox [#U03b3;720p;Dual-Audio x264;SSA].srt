1
00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:07,532
That is the reality of the Sibyl System, which maintains order in this society.

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,562
Incredible!

3
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:12,578
That's incredible!

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,529
This is the true fruit of man's intellect!

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:17,571
I can't believe the criminally 
asymptomatic provide judgment.

6
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:22,596
It's amazing that such a wonderful system protects our society!

7
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:28,542
She unconditionally accepts 
what society considers right.

8
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:32,543
She's a model citizen if there ever was one, wouldn't you agree?

9
00:00:32,543 --> 00:00:35,568
Yes, her Hue is quite clear.

10
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:39,502
Unlike your own.

11
00:00:54,566 --> 00:01:01,592
He is the only criminally asymptomatic person 
 successfully created through artificial means.

12
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:10,572
Mom!

13
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:17,560
You really are a good boy.

14
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,545
Wonderful!

15
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,583
I'm so moved!

16
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,567
This is an ideal form of law!

17
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:53,509
Mother, if she keeps you pure, 
we no longer have to color her.

18
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:56,526
We can find another use for her.

19
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,577
Oh? Like what?

20
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,522
To color Tsunemori Akane...

21
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,573
black.

22
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,566
I will go insane

23
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:25,500
if the world keeps ruining my life

24
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:29,550
I've stopped breathing

25
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,509
from the nervousness every day

26
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,501
Enigmatic feeling

27
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,593
I have to be the aggressor

28
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:45,560
The world has stopped making sense

29
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:47,548
It's dissolving

30
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:49,561
God has come to us

31
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:52,503
with sword in hand

32
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,586
The world has split in two

33
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:58,566
Half is mad,

34
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:00,566
and so am I

35
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,533
Where's the difference?

36
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,591
Where's the difference?

37
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:07,517
Only God can walk the borderline

38
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:10,584
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

39
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:14,538
Will I find you killed by my own hand?

40
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:17,551
Crazy, crazy, floating on the water

41
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:20,580
I have no focus in my soul

42
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,543
Shake me, shake me, floating on the water

43
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:27,548
I can't even look into the mirror

44
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,582
Professor,

45
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,504
omnipotence paradox

46
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,504
omnipotence paradox

47
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:41,562
suppose there's a perfect being 
that passes judgment on others.

48
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,504
omnipotence paradox

49
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,504
omnipotence paradox

50
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,500
omnipotence paradox

51
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,500
omnipotence paradox

52
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:41,508
omnipotence paradox

53
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:41,508
omnipotence paradox

54
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:44,537
Is it possible to judge that being?

55
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:46,566
“A perfect being”...

56
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,583
Are you talking about God or something?

57
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,547
They call that the omnipotence paradox.

58
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:03,501
Can an omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that even he cannot lift it?

59
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:04,560
A paradox?

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,535
Right. If he can create a rock that cannot be lifted,

61
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:13,519
then he's surrendering his omnipotence the moment it is created.

62
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,524
And if he cannot create the rock, 

then he was never omnipotent to begin with.

63
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:26,066
Either way, it leads to a contradiction.

64
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,583
As does the question you asked earlier.

65
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,588
If the being casting judgment is perfect,

66
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:29,558
then it has to be constantly judging itself as well.

67
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:34,505
Is there any way to resolve the paradox?

68
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:38,555
There's a mistake somewhere in the 
assumption, process, or conclusion.

69
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:43,568
That, or you need to prove that 
one of them is actually correct.

70
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,514
A mistake or a correct answer...

71
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,510
I have to wonder what brought this on.

72
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,553
I thought we were talking about Sibyl.

73
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:11,571
“What color”?

74
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:15,563
You want to know what Sibyl's color is.

75
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:18,517
And your own.

76
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:22,559
If the two happen to be the same...

77
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:30,502
The god of this world, huh?

78
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:34,544
I should be telling her to avoid 
discussing such dangerous topics,

79
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:37,515
and yet I'm looking forward to her answer.

80
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:40,590
Guess I'm not exactly a model citizen.

81
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,529
Dependent, am I?

82
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:53,571
This must be how Kamui's sympathizers felt.

83
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,547
Who are you?

84
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:04,530
It's been a while, Dr. Masuzaki.

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,535
I don't believe we've met since Kirito's surgery.

86
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:11,535
So you really are still alive,

87
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,539
Director Tougane!

88
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,544
How does one resolve the omnipotence paradox?

89
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:28,516
One possibility is that the omnipotent being doesn't have to be omnipotent every single moment.

90
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:34,550
After creating a rock that even he cannot lift, he makes it lighter.

91
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,588
This way, he maintains his omnipotence.

92
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:42,509
The Sibyl System takes this approach too.

93
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:49,543
By taking in criminally asymptomatic people—the ones it cannot judge—

94
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,539
it maintains its perfection.

95
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,518
But by clearing people's Hues, Kamui himself created stones that cannot be lifted,

96
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:59,557
effectively making all those people criminally asymptomatic.

97
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:03,507
As a result, he's invalidated that as a possible resolution to the paradox.

98
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,587
Going beyond that, he further asks,

99
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,524
“Can Sibyl judge Sibyl”?

100
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:17,563
If it cannot judge itself, then Sibyl 
becomes an exception to its own rules.

101
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:21,538
The solution in that case would be for Sibyl to be integrated into itself.

102
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,530
Of course, such a thing isn't possible, and thus the perfection is lost.

103
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,543
What if they can judge themselves, then?

104
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:37,514
In terms of judging everyone without exception, the perfection is maintained.

105
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,599
But in this scenario, those who comprise Sibyl cannot be criminally asymptomatic.

106
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,520
Therefore, the system didn't judge 
people who should've been judged.

107
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,504
There's only one way to resolve this paradox.

108
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:08,593
Someone shot him with a Dominator.

109
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:12,551
It seems I've lost another conversation partner.

110
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,597
If a Dominator was used,

111
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:18,514
we should assume that Kamui was behind this.

112
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,565
The Bureau's surveillance logs from 10 PM onward

113
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:30,532
have been overwritten with feed from a different date.

114
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:34,512
So they accessed the Bureau's systems?

115
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:38,596
Yeah. They left some sort of trace, but...

116
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:41,592
it's pretty bizarre.

117
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,550
Masuzaki knew too much.

118
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,501
We need to eliminate those 
who know my mother's secret.

119
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:50,597
So it really was you.

120
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,593
What's the matter? Are you scared of me?

121
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,569
You shouldn't feel that way.

122
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,581
After all, I am my mother's child—

123
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:05,511
a child of Sibyl.

124
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,545
My will is society's will.

125
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:12,570
My eyes are society's eyes.

126
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:18,533
Since you vowed to respect the law, you cannot deny me...

127
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:22,504
no matter how much you despise latent criminals.

128
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,579
What do you want?

129
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,500
There's something I want you to look into.

130
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:30,542
Find Tsunemori Akane's grandmother.

131
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:31,501
What?

132
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:37,593
We'll have the Inspector play the role of Kamui's killer.

133
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:41,581
There's one thing I'm concerned about.

134
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:47,502
An official from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has been holding a lot of meetings lately.

135
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:49,574
His name is Kuwashima Koichi.

136
00:09:49,574 --> 00:09:51,536
23 years old.

137
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:55,574
People call him the young hope of the Ministry.

138
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,558
I looked into him and found out that he went to the same elementary school as the students from that plane crash,

139
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:05,575
but he transferred to a different school one week before the field trip.

140
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:10,526
So he escaped the accident right before it happened.

141
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,580
That's his connection to Kamui.

142
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,563
Yeah.

143
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:18,585
Kuwashima is also a stockholder of the company that manages the port where we found Kamui's hideout.

144
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,564
And he's an official at the MLIT as well.

145
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:23,581
If we can assume he's working with Kamui,

146
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:28,577
it would explain how Kamui's been able to get in touch with influential figures from every sector of society.

147
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:31,553
Let's ask this official about it directly.

148
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,574
Find out his current location.

149
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:37,553
We'll take Kuwashima Koichi into custody right away.

150
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,571
To the dawn of a new society!

151
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:48,534
Cheers!

152
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,563
Sorry for the trouble.

153
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:54,538
That's okay.

154
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:58,539
I'm well suited to be the Master of Ceremonies for such a charade.

155
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:03,510
We can finally eliminate the Sibyl System.

156
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:04,573
That's right!

157
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:07,510
At long last, it will be our time!

158
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:11,565
Thanks to you, they feel free to openly denounce Sibyl.

159
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:13,565
That's revolutionary in itself.

160
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:16,566
Let's get on with it.

161
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:18,557
I can't bear to see this.

162
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:19,528
Yeah.

163
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:24,587
Thank you for all your help.

164
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:27,567
You have now fulfilled your roles.

165
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:32,513
Gentlemen.

166
00:11:32,513 --> 00:11:35,572
To conclude this meeting, 
we offer you tonight's main dish.

167
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,543
We hope you enjoy it.

168
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:08,504
Crime Coefficient is over 250.

169
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:10,513
A target for enforcement action.

170
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:11,563
Poor thing.

171
00:12:12,504 --> 00:12:14,546
Wh-Why?

172
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,505
Why are you...

173
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:19,518
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

174
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:22,520
Each of you turned a blind eye during the Season of Hell

175
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,572
and rose to power by taking advantage of its many victims.

176
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:31,531
As if that wasn't enough, you played with 
people's lives in order to keep Hue clear.

177
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,527
Crime Coefficient is 313.

178
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:37,553
Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator.

179
00:12:37,553 --> 00:12:39,503
Help me, Kamui!

180
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:43,508
This is your true color.

181
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,529
S-Stop it!

182
00:12:54,513 --> 00:12:57,530
Inspector Shisui's Dominator has been used.

183
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,597
The location is Central Hall in Chiyoda Ward.

184
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:02,572
Isn't that where we're headed right now?

185
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,572
Have the Drones form a perimeter 
and seal off the area. Hurry!

186
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:19,532
Thank you. I can finally pay my respects.

187
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,591
You shouldn't feel responsible for what happened.

188
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:27,587
I almost became a latent criminal as a child 
through the guilt I felt for escaping the crash.

189
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:32,508
The Sibyl System maintains order in this society.

190
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:38,517
The reality principle got 184 of my friends killed and almost removed me from society.

191
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,538
I won't let you get clouded.

192
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,530
Let's go see judgment carried out together.

193
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,552
I cannot guide people like you do.

194
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,590
In the end, I'm just like these men.

195
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,523
I'm one of the saved.

196
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:02,578
I see.

197
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,545
Do the rest as we planned.

198
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:11,571
I had my doubts about the intel, 
but we had no issue getting our trump card.

199
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:15,546
I thought I told you that wasn't necessary.

200
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:19,538
Tsunemori Akane is the biggest potential threat to our plans.

201
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:22,526
We're better off containing her movements.

202
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,593
That wouldn't be enough to stop her.

203
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:31,518
She keeps her color no matter 
what kind of situation she's in.

204
00:14:31,518 --> 00:14:33,585
That's exactly why I want her 
to bear witness to the judgment.

205
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:38,527
Then consider this a test.

206
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:40,548
Koichi...

207
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:41,574
Go, Kirito.

208
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,595
I'll stay here and do my part.

209
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:52,541
Kamui! The Bureau is coming.

210
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:59,559
You were already our precious friend long before you and I were reunited.

211
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:04,505
You guys can change the world.

212
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:07,501
All of you... 

213
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,576
Go and judge Sibyl!

214
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,569
That was rather quick.

215
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:23,557
I'd expect no less from the Bureau.

216
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,528
Where is Kamui?

217
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:29,524
He left.

218
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,516
But coming here wasn't a waste of time.

219
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:38,538
You get to see these people off in lieu of him.

220
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,539
This is terrible... How could you...

221
00:15:57,514 --> 00:15:59,535
How could human beings have done this?

222
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,582
A veritable vision of Hell, isn't it?

223
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:04,557
Really makes your blood curdle.

224
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,565
Did Kamui do this?

225
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,553
Don't be silly.

226
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:13,504
It's those dead officials in there who were unable to keep their Psycho-Passes clear

227
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:16,504
without playing these sorts of games.

228
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,596
And you're saying this is retaliation for what they did?

229
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:24,596
The ones burning are all illegal aliens.

230
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,543
They abandoned their own countries for some reason or another.

231
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:31,589
Officials used sweet talk to gather them together...

232
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:34,585
and then toyed with them.

233
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:42,581
They committed terrible acts like this, but when their 
Crime Coefficients rose, they sought help from Kamui.

234
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,565
That brought Kamui's wrath on them.

235
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:51,587
These people who were turned into livestock asked to be burned themselves!

236
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:54,574
They couldn't go back to their former selves.

237
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,541
Just as Kamui can't.

238
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,546
Could you come with us?

239
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:05,550
Of course.

240
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,559
But before that, please take a look at this.

241
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:30,590
What did you do?!

242
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,574
Tsunemori!

243
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,595
What did you do?!

244
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,537
Tsunemori! Stop it!

245
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:39,533
What did you do?!

246
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:41,500
Kunizuka!

247
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,568
Tsunemori Aoi...

248
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:53,509
What?!

249
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:11,545
I'm Saiga Jouji.

250
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:14,566
I'll be in charge of your interrogation.

251
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:19,537
There's an odd rumor about me spreading around.

252
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:23,537
They say that one's Psycho-Pass gets clouded by talking to me.

253
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:30,584
This is the first time I've 
wanted to see if they're right.

254
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:33,568
What is it that you want?

255
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:38,593
Tsunemori Akane has closed in on Kamui.

256
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:43,548
She's a bother to us. A sacrilege, you could say.

257
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,573
I want her to behave herself for a while.

258
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,590
Do your associates share that opinion?

259
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:52,536
After all, Kamui wants Tsunemori to come, right?

260
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,557
Where's Kamui?

261
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:59,579
He's in the guts of this city.

262
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,581
The subway?!

263
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,548
Security cameras captured Kamui 15 minutes ago.

264
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,540
Who are the people with him?

265
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,532
They're of various ages and occupations.

266
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:42,512
Check to see if any of them lost someone close to them in traffic or plane accidents 15 years ago.

267
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:43,529
Got it.

268
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:49,529
Hasebe Ryousuke lost his parents in an 
accident caused by a defective runway light.

269
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:54,526
Ogi Shinichi's older brother died in a rear-ender caused by a malfunctioning crossing gate.

270
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:59,522
Oura Yukiho lost her father in a plane crash, too.

271
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:00,593
Just as I thought.

272
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,543
The Season of Hell is the link between them all.

273
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,511
Kamui has been operating as an invisible man up until now,

274
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,565
but he has now made a move out in the open.

275
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:15,582
Which means...

276
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:28,529
He wants to settle this once and for all.

277
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,542
All is calm, all is bright

278
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:37,517
A whispering angel falls to Earth

279
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:44,589
Now it eats your body whole

280
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:49,585
It's my fault

281
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,541
You open your eyes

282
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,574
and in their grey-blue depth

283
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:08,516
I see your coldness

284
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,562
Call my name and give me a kiss

285
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,525
Embrace me

286
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:20,505
with your empty body

287
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:21,501
There is still life of sorts

288
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:22,501
There is still life of sorts

289
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:23,501
left within you

290
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:24,501
left within you

291
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:25,501
left within you

292
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:26,501
left within you

293
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:27,502
in blood red

294
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:28,502
in blood red

295
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:29,502
in blood red

296
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:30,502
I can see a brilliant eternity

297
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:31,502
I can see a brilliant eternity

298
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:32,502
I can see a brilliant eternity

299
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:33,502
You sing to me of it

300
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:34,502
You sing to me of it

301
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:35,502
What was I born for?

302
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:36,502
What was I born for?

303
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:37,503
What was I born for?

304
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,503
What was I born for?

305
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,503
What was I born for?

306
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:43,553
Love me

307
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:45,528
Don't let me go

308
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,503
Don't let me go

309
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,504
Don't let me go

310
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:10,531
Are you one of Akane's colleagues?

311
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,523
This story is a work of fiction. The names of all individuals and organizations that appear in this show are fictitious and any similarity to those in existence in the real world is purely coincidental.

This is a world where the mental state and personal tendencies of humans can be quantified. While all sorts of inclinations are recorded and policed, these measured numbers used to judge people's souls are commonly called "Psycho-Pass".
